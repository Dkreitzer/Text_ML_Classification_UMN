[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.. Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting. These include:. .  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic and business conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcurrency exchange rate fluctuations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe overall demand for enterprise software and services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcustomer acceptance of cloud-based solutions;. 11. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgovernmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral political developments.. The global economic climate continues to influence our business. This includes items such as, a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, and extreme volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets. These macroeconomic developments negatively affected, and could continue to negatively affect, our business, operating results or financial condition which, in turn, could adversely affect our stock price. A general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce their technology budgets or be unable to fund software or services purchases, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services.. Our revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future, and because we recognize revenue from subscriptions over a period of time, downturns in revenue may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.. Because we recognize recurring revenue and maintenance revenue ratably over the terms of the related subscription agreements and maintenance support agreements, most of our revenue each quarter results from recognition of deferred revenue related to agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, declines in new or renewed subscription agreements and maintenance agreements that occur in one quarter will largely be felt in future quarters, both because we may be unable to generate sufficient new revenue to offset the decline and because we may be unable to adjust our operating costs and capital expenditures to align with the changes in revenue. In addition, our subscription model makes it more difficult for us to increase our revenue rapidly in any period, because revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. It is difficult to forecast the expediency of the transition of our license customers to our cloud delivery model. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as definitive indicators of future performance.. Other factors that may cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttiming of customer budget cycles;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe priority our customers place on our products compared to other business investments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsize, timing and contract terms of new customer contracts, and unpredictable and often lengthy sales cycles;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduced renewals;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompetitive factors, including new product introductions, upgrades and discounted pricing or special payment terms offered by our competitors, as well as strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttechnical difficulties, errors or service interruptions in our solutions that may cause customer dissatisfaction with our solutions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconsolidation among our customers, which may alter their buying patterns, or business failures that may reduce demand for our solutions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toperating expenses associated with expansion of our sales force or business, and our product development efforts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcost, timing and management efforts related to the introduction of new features to our solutions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to obtain, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights and adequately safeguard the information imported to our solutions or otherwise provided to us by our customers; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\textraordinary expenses such as impairment charges, litigation or other payments related to settlement of disputes.. Any of these developments may adversely affect our revenue, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In such cases, we may be required to defer revenue recognition on sales to affected customers. In the. 12. Table of Contents. future, we may have to record additional reserves or write-offs, or defer revenue on sales transactions, which could negatively impact our financial results.. If we are unable to increase the profitability of our recurring revenue products and services, if we experience significant customer attrition, or if we are required to defer recognition of revenue, our operating results could be adversely affected.. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, substantial resources to expand, market, and implement and refine our recurring revenue products and services offerings. Our business model shift to recurring revenue, and our subscription services in particular, has generally generated much lower gross margins than our traditional perpetual license sales. If we are unable to increase the volume of our subscription business to offset the lower margins, we may not be able to achieve sustained profitability.. Factors that could harm our ability to improve our gross margins, which may affect our operating profitability, include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased costs to license and maintain third party software embedded in our software applications or the cost to create or substitute such third party software if it can no longer be licensed on commercially reasonable terms;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour inability to maintain or increase the prices customers pay for our products and services based on competitive pricing pressures and general economic conditions limiting customer demand;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased cost of third party services providers, including data centers for our cloud operations and professional services contractors performing implementation and technical support services to cloud customers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcustomer contractual requirements that delay revenue recognition until customer implementations commence production operations or customer-specific requirements are met;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsignificant attrition as customers decide for their own economic or other reasons to not renew their subscription  contracts when they are up for renewal negatively impacting the efficiency of our data centers and leading to the costs being spread over fewer customers negatively impacting gross margin; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability to implement, or delays in implementing, technology-based efficiencies and efforts to streamline and consolidate processes to reduce operating costs.. We cannot accurately predict subscription renewal rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results.. Even though our subscription contracts are typically structured for auto-renewals, we do allow our customers to elect not to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, our customers may choose to renew for fewer subscriptions (in quantity or products) or renew for shorter contract lengths. We cannot accurately predict renewal rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multiyear subscription contracts. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our service, decreases in customers' spending levels, decreases in the number of users at our customers, pricing changes and general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer.. Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services. If our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful and negative reaction occurs, our business may suffer.. 13. Table of Contents. Our credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that may limit our operational flexibility. Furthermore, if we default on our obligations under the credit agreement, our operations may be interrupted and our business and financial results could be adversely affected.. In November 2014, we entered into a credit agreement (Credit Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (Wells Fargo), under which Wells Fargo agreed to provide a term loan in the amount of $10.0 million and revolving loans to us in an amount not to exceed $10.0 million (Revolving Loans). In September 2015, we increased the maximum borrowing amount of the Revolving Loans to $15.0 million. The Credit Agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants, and its terms may restrict our current and future operations, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\taffecting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\taffecting our ability to use our cash flows, or obtain additional financing, for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreasing our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.. In addition, if we fail to comply with the covenants or payment obligations specified in the Credit Agreement, we may trigger an event of default, in which case Wells Fargo would have the right to: (i) terminate its commitment to provide additional loans under the Credit Agreement, and (ii) declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, Wells Fargo would have the right to proceed against the collateral under the Credit Agreement, which consists of substantially all our assets. If the debt under the Credit Agreement were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to sell sufficient collateral to repay this debt, which would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Our lengthy sales cycles and the difficulty in predicting timing of sales or delays may impair our operating results.. The long sales cycle for our products may cause license and subscription revenue and operating results to vary significantly from period to period. The sales cycle for our products can be six months or more and varies substantially from customer to customer. Because we sell complex and deeply integrated solutions, it can take many months of customer education to secure sales. Because our potential customers may evaluate our products before, if ever, executing definitive agreements, we may incur substantial expenses and spend significant management and legal effort in connection with a potential customer.. Our multi-product offering and the increasingly complex needs of our customers contribute to a longer and unpredictable sales cycle. Consequently, we often face difficulty predicting the quarter in which expected sales will actually occur. This contributes to the uncertainty and fluctuations in our future operating results. In particular, the corporate decision-making and approval process of our customers and potential customers has become more complicated. This has caused our average sales cycle to further increase and, in some cases, has prevented the closure of sales that we believed were likely to close.. Our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms in the future may limit our ability to grow our business and expand our operations.. Our working capital requirements in the foreseeable future are subject to numerous risks and will depend on a variety of factors. We may seek additional funding to finance our operations or should we make acquisitions. We may also need to secure additional financing due to unforeseen or unanticipated market conditions. We may try to raise additional funds through public or private financings, strategic relationships, or other arrangements. Such financing may be difficult to obtain on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, then the issuance could result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, these new securities would have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock. The terms of these securities could impose restrictions on our operations.. 14. Table of Contents. Because we depend on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue, the loss of any of these customers or our failure to attract new significant customers could adversely impact our revenue and harm our business.. We have in the past and expect in the future to derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales to a relatively small number of customers. The composition of these customers has varied in the past, and we expect that it will continue to vary over time. The loss of any significant customer or a decline in business with any significant customer would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. If we acquire companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business benefits, the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operations.. As part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. In August 2014, we acquired Exony Ltd. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties in and the cost of integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trisks of entering new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential loss of key employees;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and maintaining the security standards consistent with our other services for such technology;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnegative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe need to implement controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchallenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tin the case of foreign acquisitions, the challenges associated with integrating operations across different cultures and languages and any currency and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe tax effects of any such acquisitions.. We must compete successfully in our market segment.. The market for customer engagement software is intensely competitive. Other than product innovation and existing customer relationships, there are no substantial barriers to entry in this market, and established or new entities may enter this market in the future. While software internally developed by enterprises represents indirect competition, we also. 15. Table of Contents. compete directly with packaged application software vendors, including Avaya, Inc., Genesys Telecommunications, LivePerson, Inc., and Moxie Software, Inc. In addition, we face actual or potential competition from larger software companies such as Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Salesforce.com, Inc. and similar companies that may attempt to sell customer engagement software to their installed base.. We believe competition will continue to be fierce as current competitors increase the sophistication of their offerings and as new participants enter the market. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, broader brand recognition, and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources. With more established and better-financed competitors, these companies may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, and make more attractive offers to businesses to induce them to use their products or services. If we are unable to compete successfully, our business will be adversely affected.. If we fail to expand and improve our sales performance and marketing activities, we may be unable to grow our business, negatively impacting our operating results and financial condition.. Expansion and growth of our business is dependent on our ability to expand our sales force and on the ability of our sales force to increase sales. If we are not able to effectively develop and maintain awareness of our products in a cost-effective manner, we may not achieve widespread acceptance of our existing and future products. This may result in a failure to expand and attract new customers and enhance relationships with existing customers. This may impede our efforts to improve operations in our other areas and may result in declines in the market price of our common stock.. Due to the complexity of our customer engagement hub platform and related products and services, we must utilize highly trained sales personnel to educate prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products and services as well as provide effective customer support. If we have turnover in our sales and marketing teams, we may not be able to successfully compete with our competitors, and our results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.. Our failure to develop and expand strategic and third party distribution channels would impede our revenue growth.. Our success and future growth depends in part upon the skills, experience, performance and continued service of our distribution partners, including software and hardware vendors and resellers. Our distribution partners engage with us in a number of ways, including assisting us to identify prospective customers, distributing our products in geographies where we do not have a physical presence and distributing our products where they are considered complementary to other third party products distributed by the partner. We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and expand strategic, long-term and profitable partnerships and reseller relationships. If we are unable to do so, or if any existing or future distribution partners fail to successfully market, resell, implement or support our products for their customers, or if distribution partners represent multiple providers and devote greater resources to market, resell, implement and support competing products and services, our future revenue growth could be impeded. Our failure to develop and expand relationships with systems integrators could harm our business.. We sometimes rely on systems integrators to recommend our products to their customers and to install and support our products for their customers. We likewise depend on broad market acceptance by these system integrators of our product and service offerings. Our agreements generally do not prohibit competitive offerings and systems integrators may develop market or recommend software applications that compete with our products. Moreover, if these firms fail to implement our products successfully for their customers, we may not have the resources to implement our products on the schedule required by their customers. To the extent we devote resources to these relationships and the partnerships do not proceed as anticipated or provide revenue or other results as anticipated, our business may be harmed. Once partnerships are forged, there can be no guarantee that such relationships will be renewed in the future or available on acceptable terms. If we lose strategic third party relationships, fail to renew or develop new relationships, or fail to fully exploit revenue opportunities within such relationships, our results of operations and future growth may suffer.. 16. Table of Contents. Our international operations involve various risks.. We derived 48% of our revenue from international sales for the fiscal year 2018 compared to 51% for the fiscal year 2017 and 50% for fiscal year 2016. In addition to those discussed elsewhere in this section, our international sales operations are subject to a number of specific risks, such as:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic conditions in each country or region in which we do or plan to do business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforeign currency fluctuations and imposition of exchange controls;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpenses associated with complying with differing technology standards and language translation issues;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulty and costs in staffing and managing our international operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thealth or similar issues, such as a pandemic or epidemic;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvarious trade restrictions and tax consequences;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thostilities in various parts of the world; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduced intellectual property protections in some countries.. As of June 30, 2018, approximately 49% of our workforce was employed in India. Of our employees in India, 36% are allocated to research and development. Although the movement of certain operations internationally was principally motivated by cost cutting, the continued management of these remote operations requires significant management attention and financial resources that could adversely affect our operating performance. In addition, with the significant increase in the numbers of foreign businesses that have established operations in India, the competition to attract and retain employees there has increased significantly. As a result of the increased competition for skilled workers, we experienced increased compensation costs and expect these costs to increase in the future. Our reliance on our workforce in India makes us particularly susceptible to disruptions in the business environment in that region. In particular, sophisticated telecommunications links, high-speed data communications with other eGain offices and customers, and overall consistency and stability of our business infrastructure are vital to our day-to-day operations, and any impairment of such infrastructure will cause our financial condition and results to suffer. The maintenance of stable political relations between the United States, the European Union and India are also of great importance to our operations.. Any of these risks could have a significant impact on our product development, customer support, or professional services. To the extent the benefit of maintaining these operations abroad does not exceed the expense of establishing and maintaining such activities, our operating results and financial condition will suffer.. Difficulties in implementing our products could harm our revenue and margins.. We generally recognize license or subscription revenue from a customer sale when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product or access to the product has been delivered, the arrangement does not involve significant customization of the software, the license or subscription fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is probable. If an arrangement requires significant customization or implementation services from us, recognition of the associated license or subscription and service revenue could be delayed. The timing of the commencement and completion of these services is subject to factors that may be beyond our control, as this process may require access to the customer's facilities and coordination with the customer's personnel after delivery of the software. In addition, customers could cancel or delay product implementations. Implementation typically involves working with sophisticated software, computing and communications systems. If we experience difficulties with implementation or do not meet project milestones in a timely manner, we could be obligated to devote more customer support, engineering and other resources to a particular project. Some customers may also require us to develop customized features or capabilities. If new or existing customers cancel or have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of our professional services, support, or customized features, revenue recognition could be cancelled or further delayed and our costs could increase, causing increased variability in our operating results.. 17. Table of Contents. Our reserves may be insufficient to cover receivables we are unable to collect.. We assume a certain level of credit risk with our customers in order to do business. Conditions affecting any of our customers could cause them to become unable or unwilling to pay us in a timely manner, or at all, for products or services we have already provided them. In the past, we have experienced collection delays from certain customers, and we cannot predict whether we will continue to experience similar or more severe delays in the future. Although we have established reserves to cover losses due to delays or inability to pay, there can be no assurance that such reserves will be sufficient to cover our losses. If losses due to delays or inability to pay are greater than our reserves, it could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.. We may be subject to legal liability and/or negative publicity for the services provided to consumers through our technology platforms.. Our technology platforms enable representatives of our customers as well as individual service providers to communicate with consumers and other persons seeking information or advice on the Internet. The law relating to the liability of online platform providers such as us for the activities of users of their online platforms is often challenged in the U.S. and internationally. We may be unable to prevent users of our technology platforms from providing negligent, unlawful or inappropriate advice, information or content through our technology platforms, or from behaving in an unlawful manner, and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for negligent, fraudulent, unlawful or inappropriate activities carried out by users of our technology platforms.. Claims could be made against online services companies under both U.S. and foreign law such as fraud, defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated by users of our technology platforms. In addition, domestic and foreign legislation has been proposed that could prohibit or impose liability for the transmission over the Internet of certain types of information. Our defense of any of these actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources.. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, is intended, among other things, to reduce the liability of online service providers for listing or linking to third party web properties that include materials that infringe copyrights or rights of others. Additionally, portions of The Communications Decency Act, or CDA, are intended to provide statutory protections to online service providers who distribute third party content. A safe harbor for copyright infringement is also available under the DMCA to certain online service providers that provide specific services, if the providers take certain affirmative steps as set forth in the DMCA. Important questions regarding the safe harbor under the DMCA and the CDA have yet to be litigated, and we cannot guarantee that we will meet the safe harbor requirements of the DMCA or of the CDA. If we are not covered by a safe harbor, for any reason, we could be exposed to claims, which could be costly and time-consuming to defend.. Unplanned system interruptions and capacity constraints and failure to effect efficient transmission of customer communications and data over the Internet could harm our business and reputation.. Our customers have in the past experienced some interruptions with eGain cloud operations. We believe that these interruptions will continue to occur from time to time. These interruptions could be due to hardware and operating system failures. As a result, our business will suffer if we experience frequent or long system interruptions that result in the unavailability or reduced performance of our hosted operations or reduce our ability to provide remote management services. We expect to experience occasional temporary capacity constraints due to sharply increased traffic or other Internet-wide disruptions, which may cause unanticipated system disruptions, slower response times, impaired quality, and degradation in levels of customer service. If this were to continue to happen, our business and reputation could be seriously harmed.. The growth in the use of the Internet has caused interruptions and delays in accessing the Internet and transmitting data over the Internet. Interruptions also occur due to systems burdens brought on by unsolicited bulk email or \"Spam,\" malicious service attacks, denial of service attacks and hacking into operating systems, viruses, worms and a \"Trojan\" horse, the proliferation of which is beyond our control and may seriously impact our and our customers' businesses.. 18. Table of Contents. Because we provide cloud-based software, interruptions or delays in Internet transmissions will harm our customers' ability to receive and respond to online interactions. Therefore, our market depends on ongoing improvements being made to the entire Internet infrastructure to alleviate overloading and congestion.. Our success largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware and network systems. A significant amount of our computer and communications systems are located in Sunnyvale, California. Due to our location, our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure and similar events. Customer data that we store in third party data centers may also be vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rate and our ability to attract new customers.. We maintain a business continuity plan for our customers in the event of an outage. We maintain other co-locations for the purposes of disaster recovery as well as maintaining backups of our customer's information. We provide premium disaster recovery and standard disaster recovery to our customers.  If a customer opts not to pay for premium disaster recovery, we will only assure that their data is available within 72 hours. This delay could cause severe disruptions to our customers' customers and may result in customer termination of our solutions.  Our premium disaster recovery service provides for an alternative data center and a return to operations within one business day.. We have entered into service agreements with some of our customers that require minimum performance standards, including standards regarding the availability and response time of our remote management services. If we fail to meet these standards, our customers could terminate their relationships with us, and we could be subject to contractual refunds and service credits to, and exposure to claims for losses by, customers. Any unplanned interruption of services may harm our ability to attract and retain customers.. If our cybersecurity systems or the systems of our vendors, partners and suppliers are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer's data or our data or our IT systems, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.. Our service involves the storage and transmission of customers' proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, loss of access, litigation and possible liability. These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers (which may involve nation states and individuals sponsored by them), employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our IT systems. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers' data or our data or IT systems.. Employees or contractors have introduced vulnerabilities in, and enabled the exploitation of, our IT environments in the past and may do so in the future.  These cybersecurity attacks threaten to misappropriate our proprietary information, cause interruptions of our IT services and commit fraud. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Further, if unauthorized access or sabotage remains undetected for an extended period of time, the effects of such breach could be exacerbated.. In addition, our customers may authorize third party access to their customer data located in our cloud environment. Because we do not control the transmissions between customer authorized third parties, or the processing of such data by customer authorized third parties, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing.. Cybersecurity attacks could require significant expenditures of our capital and diversion of our resources. If these attacks are successful, they could result in the theft of proprietary, personally identifiable, confidential and sensitive information of ours, our employees, our customers and our business partners, and could materially disrupt business for us, our customers and our business partners. A successful cybersecurity attack involving our data center, network or software. 19. Table of Contents. products could also negatively impact the market perception of the effectiveness of our products or lead to contractual disputes, litigation or government regulatory action against us, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, reputation and resulting operations.. The terms we agree to in our Service Level Agreements or other contracts may result in increased costs or liabilities, which would in turn affect our results of operations.. Our Service Level Agreements provide for service credits for system unavailability, and in some cases, indemnities for loss, damage or costs resulting from use of our system. If we were required to provide any of these in a material way, our results of operations would suffer.. We have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights.. We are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. These may include claims, suits, and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, and commercial, labor and employment, and other matters.. The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received and may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we or our customers have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. In addition we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. Our technologies and those of our customers may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. Many of our agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.. The outcome of any litigation, regardless of its merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices or pay monetary damages, or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements.. Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our service to customers, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. In addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, a resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our future results of operation or cash flows or both.. We rely on trademark, copyright, trade secret laws, contractual restrictions and patent rights to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and if these rights are impaired, then our ability to generate revenue will be harmed.. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology, and our business might be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense. Any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have some U.S. patents and pending U.S. patent applications, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. In addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.. 20. Table of Contents. We might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel.. Our failure or inability to develop non-infringing technology or license proprietary rights on a timely basis would harm our business.. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. Our products may infringe issued patents that may relate to our products because patent applications in the United States are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued, and hence applications may have been filed which relate to our software products. Intellectual property litigation is expensive, time consuming, and could divert management's attention away from running our business. Litigation could also require us to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements. These royalty or license agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, in the event of a successful claim of infringement.. Software errors could be costly and time-consuming for us to correct, and could harm our reputation and impair our ability to sell our solutions.. Our solutions are based on complex software that may contain errors, or \"bugs,\" that could be costly to correct, harm our reputation and impair our ability to sell our solutions to new customers. Moreover, customers relying on our solutions may be more sensitive to such errors, and potential security vulnerabilities and business interruptions for these applications. If we incur substantial costs to correct any errors of this nature, our operating margins could be adversely affected. Because our customers depend on our solutions for critical business functions, any service interruptions could result in lost or delayed market acceptance and lost sales, higher service-level credits and warranty costs, diversion of development resources and product liability suits.. Our stock price has demonstrated volatility and continued market conditions may cause declines or fluctuations.. The price at which our common stock trades has been and will likely continue to be highly volatile and show wide fluctuations due to factors such as the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttransition to a recurring revenue model;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconcerns related to liquidity of our stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, our ability to meet announced or anticipated profitability goals and changes in or failure to meet securities analysts' expectations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements of technological innovations and/or the introduction of new services by us or our competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelopments with respect to intellectual property rights and litigation, regulatory scrutiny and new legislation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconditions and trends in the Internet and other technology industries; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral market and economic conditions.. Furthermore, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stock of technology companies, regardless of the specific operating performance of the affected company. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.. Our insiders who are significant stockholders may control the election of our board of directors and may have interests that conflict with those of other stockholders.. Our directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates and members of their immediate families, beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 35% of our outstanding capital stock as of August 31, 2018, of which our Chief Executive Officer, Ashutosh Roy, beneficially owned approximately 30% as of such date. As a result of these concentrated. 21. Table of Contents. holdings, Mr. Roy individually or together with this group has the ability to exercise significant control over most matters requiring our stockholders' approval, including the election and removal of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or sale of our company or its assets.. Our offshore product development, support and professional services may prove difficult to manage or may not allow us to realize our cost reduction goals, produce effective new solutions and provide professional services to drive growth.. We use offshore resources to perform new product and services development and provide support and professional consulting efforts, which requires detailed technical and logistical coordination. We must ensure that our international resources and personnel are aware of and understand development specifications and customer support, as well as implementation and configuration requirements and that they can meet applicable timelines. If we are unable to maintain acceptable standards of quality in support, product development and professional services, our attempts to reduce costs and drive growth through new products and margin improvements in technical support and professional services may be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Outsourcing services to offshore providers may expose us to misappropriation of our intellectual property or that of our customers, or make it more difficult to defend intellectual property rights in our technology.. If we are unable to hire and retain key personnel, our business and results of operations would be negatively affected.. Our success will depend in large part on the skills, experience and performance of our senior management, engineering, sales, marketing and other key personnel. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer and co-founder, Ashutosh Roy, could harm our business. Additionally, attrition in the Indian workforce on which we rely for research and development could have significant negative effects on us and our results of operations. If we cannot hire and retain qualified personnel, our ability to expand our business would be impaired and our results of operations would suffer.. Changes in the European regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations, such as the  European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), could expose us to risks of noncompliance and costs associated with compliance.. We have in the past relied on adherence to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor Privacy Principles and compliance with the U.S.-European Union (EU) and U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as agreed to and set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the EU and Switzerland, which established a means for legitimating the transfer of personally identifiable information (PII) by U.S. companies doing business in Europe from the European Economic Area (EEA) to the U.S. As a result of the October 6, 2015 EU Court of Justice (ECJ), opinion in Case C-362/14 (Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner) regarding the adequacy of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework, the U.S.  -  EU Safe Harbor Framework is no longer deemed to be a valid method of compliance with restrictions set forth in European law regarding the transfer of data outside of the EEA requiring us to rely on alternative mechanisms permitted under European law, such as consent and EU-specified standard contractual clauses.  The U.S. - EU Safe Harbor was replaced with the EU - U.S. Privacy Shield (Privacy Shield) in July 2016 and, starting on August 1, 2016, the Privacy Shield was made available to companies for self-certification. We have self-certified with the Privacy Shield. Nevertheless, some of the mechanisms permitting transfer of data from the EU to the U.S. have been subject to challenges, whose outcomes remain uncertain.. Furthermore, on May 25, 2018, the EU's GDPR became enforceable, imposing new obligations directly on us as both a data controller and a data processor, as well as on many of our customers. It is possible that these new laws may be interpreted or applied in a manner that is adverse to us, unforeseen, or otherwise inconsistent with our practices or that we may not adequately adapt our internal policies and/or procedures to evolving regulations, any of which could result in litigation, regulatory investigations and potential legal liability (including potential liability exposure through higher potential penalties for non-compliance),  require us to make changes to our services to enable us and/or our customers to meet the new legal requirements, require us to change our practices in a manner adverse to our business or limit access to our products and services in certain countries.. We may be unsuccessful in establishing legitimate means of transferring data from the EEA, we may experience hesitancy, reluctance, or refusal by European or multi-national customers to continue to use our services due to the potential risk. 22. Table of Contents. exposure to such customers as a result of the ECJ ruling or the implementation of GDPR, and we and our customers are at risk of enforcement actions taken by an EU data protection authority until such point in time that we ensure that all data transfers to us from the EEA are legitimized. We may find it necessary to establish systems to maintain EU-origin data in the EEA, which may involve substantial expense and distraction from other aspects of our business. We publicly post our privacy policies and practices concerning our processing, use and disclosure of PII. Our publication of our privacy policy and other statements we publish that provide promises and assurances about privacy and security can subject us to potential governmental action if they are found to be deceptive or misrepresentative of our practices. Further, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.. Privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our solutions and adversely affect our business.. Regulation related to the provision of services on the Internet is increasing, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage and use of personal information. Further, laws are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, such as the EU's e-Privacy Directive (which is set to be replaced in the coming months by a new EU e-Privacy Regulation which will have a \"direct effect\" in each EU Member State), and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive. Such laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements could reduce demand for our solutions or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our services and solutions in certain locations.. In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification or other standards established by third parties, such as TRUSTe. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business.. The costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance.. Furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers' customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our subscription solution.. Industry-specific regulation is evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions could harm our business.. Our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit customers' use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. For example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our service where required, our business may be harmed. In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards, may have an adverse impact on our business. If we are unable to achieve or maintain these industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business.. 23. Table of Contents. In some cases, industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business.. We may need to license third-party technologies and may be unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms.. To the extent we need to license third-party technologies, we may be unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may fail to successfully integrate any licensed technology into our products or services. Third-party licenses may expose us to increased risks, including risks associated with the integration of new technology, the diversion of resources from the development of our own proprietary technology, and our inability to generate revenue from new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs. Our inability to obtain and successfully integrate any of these licenses could delay product and service development until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed and integrated. This in turn would harm our business and operating results.. Changes to current accounting policies could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way in which we conduct our business.. Generally accepted accounting principles and the related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations for some of our significant accounting policies are highly complex and require subjective judgments and assumptions. Some of our more significant accounting policies that could be affected by changes in the accounting rules and the related implementation guidelines and interpretations include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trecognition of revenue;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontingencies and litigation; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\taccounting for income taxes.. Changes in these or other rules, or scrutiny of our current accounting practices, or a determination that our judgments or assumptions in the application of these accounting principles were incorrect, could have a significant adverse effect on our reported operating results or the way in which we conduct our business.. We depend on broad market acceptance of our applications and of our business model.. We depend on the widespread acceptance and use of our applications as an effective solution for businesses seeking to manage high volumes of customer interactions across multiple channels, including Web, phone, email, print and in-person. While we believe the potential to be very large, we cannot accurately estimate the size or growth rate of the potential market for such product and service offerings generally, and we do not know whether our products and services in particular will achieve broad market acceptance. The market for customer engagement software is rapidly evolving, and concerns over the security and reliability of online transactions, the privacy of users and quality of service or other issues may inhibit the growth of the Internet and commercial online services. If the market for our applications fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, our business will be seriously harmed.. Furthermore, our business model is premised on business assumptions that are still evolving. Our business model assumes that both customers and companies will increasingly elect to communicate through multiple channels, as well as demand integration of the online channels into the traditional telephone-based call center. If any of these assumptions is incorrect or if customers and companies do not adopt digital technology in a timely manner, our business will be seriously harmed and our stock price will decline.. We may be unable to respond to the rapid technological change and changing customer preferences in the online sales, marketing, customer service, and/or online consumer services industries and this may harm our business.. If we are unable, for technological, legal, financial or other reasons, to adapt in a timely manner to changing market conditions in the online sales, marketing, customer service and/or e-commerce industry or our customers' or Internet users' requirements or preferences, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. Business on the Internet is characterized by rapid technological change. In addition, the market for online sales, marketing, customer service and expert advice solutions is relatively new. Changes in customer and Internet user. 24. Table of Contents. requirements and preferences, frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices such as but not limited to security standards could render our services and our proprietary technology and systems obsolete. The rapid evolution of these products and services will require that we continually improve the performance, features and reliability of our services. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenhance the features and performance of our services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelop and offer new services that are valuable to companies doing business online as well as Internet users; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trespond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices in a cost-effective and timely manner.. If any of our new services, including upgrades to our current services, do not meet our customers' or Internet users' expectations, our business may be harmed. Updating our technology may require significant additional capital expenditures and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. If new services require us to grow rapidly, this could place a significant strain on our managerial, operational, technical and financial resources. In order to manage our growth, we could be required to implement new or upgraded operating and financial systems, procedures and controls. Our failure to expand our operations in an efficient manner could cause our expenses to grow, our revenue to decline or grow more slowly than expected and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. We may engage in future acquisitions or investments that could dilute our existing stockholders, cause us to incur significant expenses or harm our business.. We may review acquisition or investment prospects that we believe may complement our current business or enhance our technological capabilities. Integrating any newly acquired businesses or their technologies or products may be expensive and time-consuming, and may not result in benefits to our business. To finance any acquisitions, we may raise funds through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, if at all, and, in the case of equity financings, may result in dilution to our existing stockholders. We may not be able to operate acquired businesses profitably. If we are unable to integrate newly acquired entities or technologies effectively, our operating results could suffer. Future acquisitions by us could also result in large and immediate write-offs, incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, or amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our operating results.. We may not be able to realize the benefits of offering the limited \"Try & Buy\" free version of our service.. We offer a limited version of our subscription service to customers or potential customers free of charge (known as \"Try & Buy\") in order to promote usage, brand and product awareness, and adoption, and we invest time and resources for such initial engagements without compensation from the customers. Some customers never enter into a definitive contract for our paid subscription service despite the time and effort we may have expended on such Try & Buy initiatives.  To the extent that these customers do not become paying customers, we will not realize the intended benefits of this marketing effort, and our ability to grow our business and revenue may be harmed.. The uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of Brexit may cause increased economic volatility, affecting our operations and business.. On June 23, 2016, voters in the United Kingdom (UK) approved an advisory referendum to withdraw membership from the EU, which proposed exit (referred to as Brexit) could cause disruptions to, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business in the UK and EU, including affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees. As a result, Brexit could have an adverse effect on our future business, financial results and operations. The formal process for UK leaving the EU began in March 2017, when the UK served notice to the European Council under Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon. The long-term nature of the UK's relationship with the EU is unclear and there is considerable uncertainty when any relationship will be agreed and implemented. The political and economic instability created by Brexit has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets and uncertainty regarding the regulation of data protection in the UK. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people between the UK, the EU, and elsewhere. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements. 25. Table of Contents. the UK makes to retain access to EU markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Further, uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the UK and the other economies in which we operate. There can be no assurance that any or all of these events will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition."
