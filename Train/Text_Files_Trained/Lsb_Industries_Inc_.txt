[1] "ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and may be required to take other actions to satisfy the obligations under our debt agreements or to redeem our preferred stock, which may not be successful.. Our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations and on our redemption obligations for the Series E cumulative redeemable Class C preferred stock (\"Series E Redeemable Preferred\") depends on our financial condition and operating performance, prevailing economic and competitive conditions, and certain financial, business and other factors, some of which may be beyond our control.  We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows sufficient to pay the principal and interest on our debt, including the $375 million principal amount of our Senior Secured Notes (the \"Senior Secured Notes\"), or if and when applicable, the outstanding amount of the Working Capital Revolver Loan or to pay the cumulative dividends and redemption payment on the Series E Redeemable Preferred should the holder choose to redeem it.. If cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt, dividend or preferred stock redemption obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and will need to seek additional capital through the issuance of debt, the issuance of equity, asset sales or a combination of the foregoing.  If we are unsuccessful, we will need to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to dispose of other assets or operations, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance debt or redeemable equity.  These alternative measures may not be successful, may not be completed on economically attractive terms, or may not be adequate for us to meet our debt or preferred stock redemption obligations when due.  Additionally, our debt agreements and the operating agreements associated with our Series E Redeemable Preferred limit the use of the proceeds from many dispositions of assets or operations.  As a result, we may not be permitted to use the proceeds from these dispositions to satisfy our debt or preferred stock redemption obligations.. Further, if we suffer or appear to suffer from a lack of available liquidity, the evaluation of our creditworthiness by counterparties and rating agencies and the willingness of third parties to do business with us could be materially and adversely affected.  In particular, our credit ratings could be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely at any time by the rating agencies.  Downgrades in our long-term debt ratings generally cause borrowing costs to increase and the potential pool of investors and funding sources to decrease and could trigger liquidity demands pursuant to the terms of contracts, leases or other agreements.  Any future transactions by us, including the issuance of additional debt, the sale of any operating assets, or any other transaction to manage our liquidity, could result in temporary or permanent downgrades of our credit ratings.. 9. Our substantial level of indebtedness, including dividend requirements relating to our preferred stock, could limit our financial and operating activities, and adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs.. We currently have a substantial amount of indebtedness and dividend requirements relating to our preferred stock.  As a result, this level could, among other things:. •  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal (primarily relating to 2019), interest and dividends, thereby reducing the funds available for operations and future business opportunities;. •  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, including our repurchase obligations;. •  limit our ability to borrow additional money if needed for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes, on satisfactory terms or at all;. •  limit our ability to adjust to changing economic, business and competitive conditions;. •  place us at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who may have less indebtedness or greater access to financing;. •  make us more vulnerable to an increase in interest rates, a downturn in our operating performance or a decline in general economic conditions; and. •  make us more susceptible to changes in credit ratings, which could affect our ability to obtain financing in the future and increase the cost of such financing.. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.. Our debt agreements and our preferred stock contain covenants and restrictions that limit flexibility in operating our businesses.  A breach of these covenants or restrictions could result in an event of default under one or more of our debt agreements or contracts at different entities within our capital structure, including as a result of cross acceleration or default provisions.. Our debt agreements and our preferred stock contain various covenants and other restrictions that, among other things, limit flexibility in operating our businesses.  A breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a significant portion of our debt becoming due and payable or could result in significant contractual liability.  Our ability to comply with certain of our covenants and restrictions can be affected by events beyond our control.  These covenants and other restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:. •  incur additional debt or issue preferred shares;. •  pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make other restricted payments;. •  make investments;. •  sell or transfer assets;. •  create liens on assets to secure debt;. •  consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;. •  enter into transactions with affiliates;. •  designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and. •  repay, repurchase or modify certain subordinated and other material debt.. We may pursue various transactions and initiatives to address our highly leveraged balance sheet and significant cash flow requirements.. If our existing financing sources are insufficient for our financing needs, or if we are unable to refinance debt and redemption obligations as they become due, we may be required to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, dispose of assets or operations, seek additional capital, restructure or refinance debt, or undertake a combination of some or all of these.  Any transactions and initiatives that we may pursue may have significant adverse effects on our business, capital structure, ownership, liquidity, credit ratings and results of operations.  These measures may not be successful, may not produce the desired outcome if completed, may not be completed on economically attractive terms, and may not be adequate for us to meet our debt or redemption obligations when due.  This could ultimately adversely affect us, our debtholders, and our shareholders in a material manner.. 10. There are a number of important limitations and exceptions to the covenants and restrictions contained in our debt agreements and our preferred stock.. In addition, certain failures to make payments on significant contract obligations when due constitute a cross-default of some of our debt instruments, including the indenture governing our Senior Secured Notes (the \"Senior Secured Notes Indenture\").  A breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in an event of default under one or more of our debt agreements at different entities within our capital structure, including as a result of cross acceleration or default provisions.  Upon the occurrence of an event of default under one of these debt agreements, our lenders or noteholders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under that debt agreement to be immediately due and payable and/or terminate all commitments to extend further credit.  Such actions by those lenders or noteholders could cause cross defaults or accelerations under our other debt.  If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders or noteholders could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure such debt.  In the case of a default under debt that is guaranteed, holders of such debt could also seek to enforce the guarantees.  If lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of all borrowings, we would likely not have sufficient assets and funds to repay those borrowings.  Such occurrence could result in our or our applicable subsidiary going into bankruptcy, liquidation or insolvency.. Despite continuing investment to upgrade and replace equipment on an ongoing basis, the age of our chemical manufacturing facilities increases the risk for unplanned downtime, which may be significant.. Our business is comprised of operating units of various ages and levels of automated control.  While we have continued to make significant annual capital improvements, potential age or control related issues have occurred in the past and may occur in the future, which could cause damage to the equipment and ancillary facilities.  As a result, we have experienced and may continue to experience additional downtime at our chemical facilities in the future.. The equipment required for the manufacture of our products is specialized, and the time for replacement of such equipment can be lengthy, resulting in extended downtime in the affected unit.  Although we use various reliability and inspection programs and maintain a significant inventory of spare equipment, which are intended to mitigate the extent of production losses, unplanned outages may still occur.  As a result, these planned and unplanned downtime events at our chemical facilities have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our operating results, liquidity and financial condition.. LSB is a holding company and depends, in large part, on receiving funds from its subsidiaries to fund our indebtedness.. Because LSB is a holding company and operations are conducted through its subsidiaries, LSB's ability to meet its obligations depends, in large part, on the operating performance and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of its subsidiaries to make distributions and pay dividends to LSB.. We have not paid dividends on our outstanding common stock in many years.. We have not paid cash dividends on our outstanding common stock in many years, and we do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends on our outstanding common stock in the near future.  Although our Board has not made a decision whether or not to pay dividends on our common stock in 2018, it is unlikely we will pay dividends on our common stock until we have repaid or refinanced our debt and our preferred stock.  In addition, there are certain limitations contained in our loan and securities purchase agreements that may limit our ability to pay dividends on our outstanding common stock.. Future issuances or potential issuances of our common stock or preferred equity could adversely affect the price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings and could dilute the percentage ownership or voting power of our common stockholders.. Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, preferred stock or equity-related securities in the public market, or the issuance of a substantial amount of our common stock as the result of the conversion of our outstanding convertible preferred stocks, or the perception that such sales or conversions could occur, could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock and could dilute the value of common stock held by our existing stockholders.  No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of common stock, preferred stock, or equity-related securities, conversions of our outstanding preferred stocks into shares of common stock, or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale will have on the trading price of our common stock.  Such future sales or conversions could also significantly reduce the percentage ownership and voting power of our existing common stockholders.. Deterioration of global market and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.. A slowdown of, or persistent weakness in, economic activity caused by a deterioration of global market and economic conditions could adversely affect our business in the following ways, among others: conditions in the credit markets could impact the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations; the failure of our customers to fulfill their. 11. purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and affect our working capital; and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses. We also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to our customers' reluctance to replenish inventories.  The overall impact of a global economic downturn on us is difficult to predict, and our business could be materially adversely impacted.. In addition, conditions in the international market for nitrogen fertilizer significantly influence our operating results.  The international market for fertilizers is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the U.S. currency and its impact on the importation of fertilizers, foreign agricultural policies, the existence of, or changes in, import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and other regulatory policies of foreign governments, as well as the U.S. laws and policies affecting foreign trade and investment.. Seasonality can adversely affect our business.. If seasonal demand is less than we expect, we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored (in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs) or liquidated (in which case the selling price may be below our production, procurement and storage costs).  The risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are exacerbated by the volatility of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers.  If prices for our products rapidly decrease, we may be subject to inventory write-downs, adversely affecting our operating results.  If seasonal demand is greater than we expect, we may experience product shortages, and customers of ours may turn to our competitors for products that they would otherwise have purchased from us.. Ammonia can be very volatile and extremely hazardous.  Any liability for accidents or intentional acts such as terrorism involving ammonia or other products we produce or transport that cause severe damage to property or injury to the environment and human health could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions.  In addition, the costs of transporting ammonia could increase significantly in the future.. We manufacture, process, store, handle, distribute and transport ammonia, which can be very volatile and extremely hazardous.  Major accidents or releases involving ammonia could cause severe damage or injury to property, the environment and human health, as well as a possible disruption of supplies and markets.  Such an event could result in civil lawsuits, fines, penalties and regulatory enforcement proceedings, all of which could lead to significant liabilities.  Any damage to persons, equipment or property or other disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in operating revenues and significant additional cost to replace or repair and insure our assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  We periodically experience minor releases of ammonia related to leaks from our equipment.  Similar events may occur in the future.. A major factor underlying the current high level of demand for our nitrogen-based fertilizer products is the production of ethanol.  A decrease in ethanol production, an increase in ethanol imports or a shift away from corn as a principal raw material used to produce ethanol could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions.. A major factor underlying the solid level of demand for our nitrogen-based fertilizer products is the production of ethanol in the United States and the use of corn in ethanol production.  Ethanol production in the United States is highly dependent upon a myriad of federal statutes and regulations and is made significantly more competitive by various federal and state incentives and mandated usage of renewable fuels pursuant to the federal renewable fuel standards (\"RFS\").  To date, the RFS has been satisfied primarily with fuel ethanol blended into gasoline.  However, a number of factors, including the continuing \"food versus fuel\" debate and studies showing that expanded ethanol usage may increase the level of greenhouse gases in the environment as well as be unsuitable for small engine use, have resulted in calls to reduce subsidies for ethanol, allow increased ethanol imports and to repeal or waive (in whole or in part) the current RFS, any of which could have an adverse effect on corn-based ethanol production, planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand. Therefore, ethanol incentive programs may not be renewed, or if renewed, they may be renewed on terms significantly less favorable to ethanol producers than current incentive programs.. Furthermore, most ethanol is currently produced from corn and other raw grains, such as milo or sorghum, especially in the Midwest.  The current trend in ethanol production research is to develop an efficient method of producing ethanol from cellulose-based biomass, such as agricultural waste, forest residue, municipal solid waste and energy crops (plants grown for use to make biofuels or directly exploited for their energy content).  If an efficient method of producing ethanol from cellulose-based biomass is developed, the demand for corn may decrease significantly, which could reduce demand for nitrogen fertilizer products and have a material adverse effect on the prices we receive on sales of our ammonia products and our results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions.. 12. Our business and customers are sensitive to adverse economic cycles.. Our business can be affected by cyclical factors such as inflation, currency exchange rates, global energy policy and costs, global market conditions and economic downturns in specific industries.  Certain sales are sensitive to the level of activity in the agricultural, mining, automotive and housing industries.  Therefore, substantial changes could adversely affect our operating results, liquidity, financial condition and capital resources.. Weather conditions adversely affect our business.. The products (primarily agricultural) produced and sold by us have been in the past, and could be in the future, materially affected by adverse weather conditions (such as excessive rain or drought) in the primary markets for our fertilizer and related agricultural products.  In addition, weather can cause an interruption to the operations of our chemical facilities.  Many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events.  These climate changes might also occur as the result of other phenomena that human activity is unable to influence, including changes in solar activity and volcanic activity.  Regardless of the cause, if any of these unusual weather events occur during the primary seasons for sales of our agricultural products (March-June and September-November), this could have a material adverse effect on our agricultural sales and our financial condition and results of operations.. There is intense competition in the markets we serve.. Substantially all of the markets in which we participate are highly competitive with respect to product quality, price, distribution, service, and reliability.  We compete with many companies, domestic and foreign, that have greater financial, marketing and other resources.  Specifically, the overall nitrogen market is being affected as a result of the number of announced, started and recently completed nitrogen expansion projects in the U.S.  Competitive factors could require us to reduce prices or increase spending on product development, marketing and sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.. We compete with many U.S. producers and producers in other countries, including state-owned and government-subsidized entities.  Some competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from chemical sales, which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities.  Our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources sufficiently either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions, joint ventures or partnerships.  An inability to compete successfully could result in the loss of customers, which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.. A substantial portion of our sales is dependent upon a limited number of customers.. For 2017, seven customers accounted for approximately 46% of our consolidated net sales.  One of these customers is Covestro, which sales are pursuant to the Covestro Agreement under which one of our subsidiaries operates a nitric plant located within Covestro's chemical manufacturing complex as discussed above under Industrial Acids and Other Chemical Products of Item 1 - Business.  This agreement: (a) allows us to pass-through most of the costs of producing the nitric acid that Covestro purchases, including the cost of ammonia; (b) to receive management fees for managing the operations and marketing nitric acid at the Baytown Facility and; (c) to receive a portion of any carbon credits that are sold.  The loss of, or a material reduction in purchase levels by, one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity if we are unable to replace a customer with other sales on substantially similar terms.. Cost and the lack of availability of raw materials could materially affect our profitability and liquidity.. Our sales and profits are heavily affected by the costs and availability of primary raw materials.  These primary raw materials are subject to considerable price volatility.  Historically, when there have been rapid increases in the cost of these primary raw materials, we have sometimes been unable to timely increase our sales prices to cover all of the higher costs incurred.  While we periodically enter into futures/forward contracts to economically hedge against price increases in certain of these raw materials, there can be no assurance that we will effectively manage against price fluctuations in those raw materials.. Natural gas represents the primary raw material feedstock in the production of most of our chemical products.  Although we enter into contracts with certain customers that provide for the pass-through of raw material costs, we have a substantial amount of sales that do not provide for the pass-through of raw material costs.  Also, the spot sales prices of our agricultural products may not correlate to the cost of natural gas but rather reflect market conditions for similar and competing nitrogen sources.  This lack of correlation can compromise our ability to recover our full cost to produce the products in this market.  As a result, in the future, we may not be able to pass along to all of our customers the full amount of any increases in raw material costs.  Future price fluctuations in our raw materials may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.. 13. Additionally, we depend on certain vendors to deliver natural gas and other key components that are required in the production of our products.  Any disruption in the supply of natural gas and other key components could result in lost production or delayed shipments.. The price of natural gas in North America and worldwide has been volatile in recent years and has declined on average due in part to the development of significant natural gas reserves, including shale gas, and the rapid improvement in shale gas extraction techniques, such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling.  Future production of natural gas from shale formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or hydraulic fracturing or increase its cost or by reduction in oil exploration and development prompted by lower oil prices and resulting in production of less associated natural gas.  Additionally, increased demand for natural gas, particularly in the Gulf Coast Region, due to increased industrial demand and increased natural gas exports could result in increased natural gas prices.. We have suspended in the past, and could suspend in the future, production at our chemical facilities due to, among other things, the high cost or lack of availability of natural gas and other key components, which could adversely affect our competitiveness in the markets we serve.  Accordingly, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially affected in the future by the lack of availability of natural gas and other key components and increase costs relating to the purchase of natural gas and other key components.. We may have inadequate insurance.. While we maintain liability, property and business interruption insurance, including certain coverage for environmental contamination, it is subject to coverage limits and policies that may exclude coverage for some types of damages.  Although there may currently be sources from which such coverage may be obtained, the coverage may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or the possible types of liabilities that may be incurred by us may not be covered by our insurance.  In addition, our insurance carriers may not be able to meet their obligations under the policies, or the dollar amount of the liabilities may exceed our policy limits.  Even a partially uninsured claim, if successful and of significant magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.. Furthermore, we are subject to litigation for which we could be obligated to bear legal, settlement and other costs, which may be in excess of any available insurance coverage.  If we are required to incur all or a portion of the costs arising out of any litigation or investigation as a result of inadequate insurance proceeds, if any, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.  For further discussion of our litigation, please see \"Other Pending, Threatened or Settled Litigation\" in Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.. Loss of key personnel could negatively affect our business.. We believe that our performance has been and will continue to be dependent upon the efforts of our principal executive officers.  We cannot ensure that our principal executive officers will continue to be available.  Although we have employment agreements with certain of our principal executive officers, including Daniel D. Greenwell and Mark T. Behrman, we do not have employment agreements with all of our key personnel.  The loss of some of our principal executive officers could have a material adverse effect on us.  We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel.. Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war, and natural disasters (such as hurricanes, pandemic health crises, etc.), have negatively affected and could negatively affect U.S. and foreign companies, the financial markets, the industries where we operate, our operations and our profitability.. Terrorist attacks in the U.S and elsewhere and natural disasters (such as hurricanes or pandemic health crises) have in the past and can in the future negatively affect our operations.  We cannot predict further terrorist attacks and natural disasters in the U.S. and elsewhere.  These attacks or natural disasters have contributed to economic instability in the U.S. and elsewhere, and further acts of terrorism, violence, war or natural disasters could affect the industries where we operate, our ability to purchase raw materials, our business, results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, terrorist attacks and natural disasters may directly affect our physical facilities, especially our chemical facilities, or those of our suppliers or customers and could affect our sales, our production capability and our ability to deliver products to our customers.  In the past, hurricanes affecting the Gulf Coast of the U.S. have negatively affected our operations and those of our customers.  As previously noted, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events.  If any such effects, whether anthropogenic or otherwise, were to occur in areas where we or our clients operate, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.. 14. Cyber security risks could adversely affect our business operations.. As we continue to increase our dependence on information technologies to conduct our operations, the risks associated with cyber security also increase.  We rely on our enterprise resource planning software (\"ERP\") and other information systems, among other things, to manage our manufacturing, supply chain, accounting and financial functions.  This risk not only applies to us, but also to third parties on whose systems we place significant reliance for the conduct of our business.  We are significantly dependent upon internet connectivity and a third-party cloud hosting vendor.  We have implemented security procedures and measures in order to protect our information from being vulnerable to theft, loss, damage or interruption from a number of potential sources or events.  Although we believe these measures and procedures are appropriate, we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate, prevent, or recover from rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks.  Compromises to our information systems could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.. Our transportation and distribution activities rely on third party providers, which subject us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations.. We rely on railroad, trucking, pipeline and other transportation service providers to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities, to coordinate and deliver finished products to our storage and distribution system and our retail centers and to ship finished products to our customers.  These transportation operations, equipment and services are subject to various hazards, including adverse operating conditions, extreme weather conditions, system failures, work stoppages, equipment and personnel shortages, delays, accidents such as spills and derailments and other accidents and operating hazards.. In the event of a disruption of existing transportation or terminaling facilities for our products or raw materials, alternative transportation and terminaling facilities may not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our customers or facilities.  An extended interruption in the delivery of our products to our customers or the supply of natural gas, ammonia or sulfur to our production facilities could adversely affect sales volumes and margins.. These transportation operations, equipment and services are also subject to environmental, safety, and regulatory oversight.  Due to concerns related to accidents, terrorism or increasing concerns regarding transportation of potentially hazardous substances, local, provincial, state and federal governments could implement new regulations affecting the transportation of raw materials or our finished products.  If transportation of our products is delayed or we are unable to obtain raw materials as a result of any third party's failure to operate properly or the other hazards described above, or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment, or if there are significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment, our revenues and cost of operations could be adversely affected.  In addition, we may experience increases in our transportation costs, or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors.. Future technological innovation could affect our business.. Future technological innovation, such as the development of seeds that require less crop nutrients, or developments in the application of crop nutrients, if they occur, could have the potential to adversely affect the demand for our products and results of operations.. We are reliant on a limited number of key facilities.. Our nitrogen production is concentrated in four separate complexes.  The suspension of operations at any of these complexes could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Moreover, our facilities may be subject to failure of equipment that may be difficult to replace and could result in operational disruptions.. Potential increase of imported agricultural products.. Russia and Ukraine both have substantial capacity to produce and export fertilizer grade AN. Producers in these countries also benefit from below-market prices for natural gas, due to government regulation and other factors.  Historically, the U.S. Department of Commerce (\"DOC\") has restrained AN imports from Russia and Ukraine with anti-dumping tariffs.  However, these tariffs were resolved by the DOC in 2016 and 2017 respectfully.  As a result, we may face more substantial competition from Russian producers of fertilizer grade AN.. In addition, producers in China have substantial capacity to produce and export urea.  Depending on various factors, including prevailing prices from other exporters, the price of coal, and the price of China's export tariff, higher volumes of urea from China could be imported into the U.S. at prices that could have an adverse effect on the selling prices of other nitrogen products, including the nitrogen products we manufacture and sell.. 15. Current and future legislative or regulatory requirements affecting our business may result in increased costs and decreased revenues, cash flows and liquidity or could have other negative effects on our business.. Our business is subject to numerous health, safety, security and environmental laws and regulations.  The manufacture and distribution of chemical products are activities that entail health, safety and environmental risks and impose obligations under health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, many of which provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations.  Although we believe we have established processes to monitor, review and manage our businesses to comply with the numerous health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, we previously were, and in the future, may be, subject to fines, penalties and sanctions for violations and substantial expenditures for cleanup costs and other liabilities relating to the handling, manufacture, use, emission, discharge or disposal of effluents at or from our chemical facilities.  Further, a number of our chemical facilities are dependent on environmental permits to operate, the loss or modification of which could have a material adverse effect on their operations and our results of operation and financial condition.  These operating permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation.  In addition, third parties may contest our ability to receive or renew certain permits that we need to operate, which can lengthen the application process or even prevent us from obtaining necessary permits.  We regularly monitor and review our operations, procedures and policies for compliance with permits, laws and regulations.  Despite these compliance efforts, risk of noncompliance or permit interpretation is inherent in the operation of our business.. There can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate.  We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of compliance.. Changes to the production equipment at our chemical facilities that are required in order to comply with health, safety and environmental regulations may require substantial capital expenditures.. Explosions and/or losses at other chemical facilities that we do not own (such as the April 2013 explosion in West, Texas) could also result in new or additional legislation or regulatory changes, particularly relating to public health, safety or any of the products manufactured and/or sold by us or the inability on the part of our customers to obtain or maintain insurance as to certain products manufactured and/or sold by us, which could have a negative effect on our revenues, cash flow and liquidity.. In summary, new or changed laws and regulations or the inability of our customers to obtain or maintain insurance in connection with any of our chemical products could have an adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity and financial condition.. We may be required to modify or expand our operating, sales and reporting procedures and to install additional equipment in order to comply with current and possible future government regulations.. The chemical industry in general, and producers and distributors of ammonia and AN specifically, are scrutinized by the government, industry and public on security issues.  Under current and proposed regulations, we may be required to incur substantial additional costs relating to security at our chemical facilities and distribution centers, as well as in the transportation of our products.  These costs could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  The cost of such regulatory changes, if significant, could lead some of our customers to choose other products over ammonia and AN, which may have a significant adverse effect on our business.. The \"Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Act of 2007\" was enacted by the U.S. Congress, and subsequently the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") published a notice of proposed rulemaking in 2011.  This regulation proposes to require sellers, buyers, their agents and transporters of solid AN and certain solid mixtures containing AN to possess a valid registration issued by DHS, keep certain records, report the theft or unexplained loss of regulated materials, and comply with certain other new requirements.  We and others affected by this proposal have submitted appropriate comments to DHS regarding the proposed regulation.  It is possible that DHS could significantly revise the requirements currently being proposed.  Depending on the provisions of the final regulation to be promulgated by DHS and on our ability to pass these costs to our customers, these requirements may have a negative effect on the profitability of our AN business and may result in fewer distributors who are willing to handle the product.  DHS has not finalized this rule, and has indicated that its next action, and the timing of such an action, is undetermined.. On August 1, 2013, U.S. President Obama issued an executive order addressing the safety and security of chemical facilities in response to recent incidents involving chemicals such as the explosion at West, Texas.  The President directed federal agencies to enhance existing regulations and make recommendations to the U.S. Congress to develop new laws that may affect our business.  In January 2016, the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (\"CSB\") released its final report on the West, Texas incident.  The CSB report identifies several federal and state regulations and standards that could be strengthened to reduce the risk of a similar incident occurring in the future.  While the CSB does not have authority to directly regulate our business, the findings in this report, and other activities taken in response to the West, Texas incident by federal, state, and local regulators may result in additional regulation of our processes and products.. 16. In January 2017, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") finalized revisions to its Risk Management Program.  The revisions include new requirements for certain facilities to perform hazard analyses, third-party auditing, incident investigations and root cause analyses, emergency response exercises, and to publicly share chemical and process information.  Compliance with many of the rule's new requirements will be required beginning in 2021.  The EPA has temporarily delayed the rule's effective date until February 19, 2019 and has indicated that it may further delay the rule's implementation, however, this delay has been challenged in court and certain of those challenges remain pending.  These requirements may have a negative effect on the profitability of our AN business.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") is likewise considering changes to its Process Safety Management standards.  In addition, DHS, the EPA, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives updated a joint chemical advisory on the safe storage, handling, and management of AN.  While these actions may result in additional regulatory requirements or changes to our operators, it is difficult to predict at this time how these and any other possible regulations, if and when adopted, will affect our business, operations, liquidity or financial results.. Proposed and existing governmental laws and regulations relating to greenhouse gas and other air emissions may subject certain of our operations and customers to significant new costs and restrictions on their operations and may reduce sales of our products.. Our chemical manufacturing facilities use significant amounts of electricity, natural gas and other raw materials necessary for the production of their chemical products that result, or could result, in certain greenhouse gas emissions into the environment.  Federal and state legislatures and administrative agencies, including the EPA, are considering the scope and scale of greenhouse gas or other air emission regulation.  Legislation and administrative actions have been considered that would regulate greenhouse gas emissions at some point in the future for our facilities, and existing and possible actions have already affected certain of our customers, leading to closure or rate reductions of certain facilities.. In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA adopted regulations pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from various sources.  For example, the EPA requires certain large stationary sources to obtain preconstruction and operating permits for pollutants regulated under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act.  Facilities required to obtain preconstruction permits for such pollutants are also required to meet \"best available control technology\" standards that are being established by the states.  These regulatory requirements could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources.  The EPA has also instituted a mandatory greenhouse gas reporting requirement that began in 2010, which affects all of our chemical manufacturing sites.. Although greenhouse gas regulation could: increase the price of the electricity and other energy sources purchased by our chemical facilities; increase costs for natural gas and other raw materials (such as ammonia); potentially restrict access to or the use of certain raw materials necessary to produce our chemical products; and require us to incur substantial expenditures to retrofit our chemical facilities to comply with the proposed new laws and regulations regulating greenhouse gas emissions.  Federal, state and local governments may also pass laws mandating the use of alternative energy sources, such as wind power and solar energy, which may increase the cost of energy use in certain of our chemical and other manufacturing operations.  For instance, the EPA published a rule, known as the Clean Power Plan, to limit greenhouse gases from electric power plants.  The EPA is currently reviewing the Clean Power Plan however, it could result in increased electricity costs due to increased requirements for use of alternative energy sources, and a decreased demand for coal-generated electricity.. Laws, regulations or other issues related to climate change could have a material adverse effect on us.. If we, or other companies with which we do business become subject to laws or regulations related to climate change, it could have a material adverse effect on us.  The United States may enact new laws, regulations and interpretations relating to climate change, including potential cap-and-trade systems, carbon taxes and other requirements relating to reduction of carbon footprints and/or greenhouse gas emissions.  Other countries have enacted climate change laws and regulations and the United States has been involved in discussions regarding international climate change treaties.  The federal government and some of the states and localities in which we operate have enacted certain climate change laws and regulations and/or have begun regulating carbon footprints and greenhouse gas emissions.  Although these laws and regulations have not had any known material adverse effect on us to date, they could result in substantial costs, including compliance costs, monitoring and reporting costs and capital.  Furthermore, our reputation could be damaged if we violate climate change laws or regulations.  We cannot predict how future laws and regulations, or future interpretations of current laws and regulations, related to climate change will affect our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.  Lastly, the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate.  These may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels and changing temperatures.  Any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on us.. 17. Certain of our stockholders control a significant amount of our voting stock, and their interests could conflict with interests of other stockholders.. LSB Funding LLC (\"LSB Funding\"), our largest voting shareholder and an unrelated third party, owns one share of Series F redeemable Class C preferred stock (the \"Series F Redeemable Preferred\"), which has voting rights with common stock equal to 15.8% of the total voting power of LSB's common stock as of February 16, 2018.. Jack E. Golsen, Chairman Emeritus of our Board of Directors (the \"Board\") and Barry H. Golsen, a member of our Board, entities owned by them, and trusts for which they possess voting or dispositive power as trustee (the \"Golsen Holders\") owned as of February 16, 2018, an aggregate of 2,185,517 shares of our common stock and 1,020,000 shares of our voting preferred stock (1,000,000 of which shares have .875 votes per share, or 875,000 votes), which together vote as a class and represent approximately 10.4% of the voting power (prior to conversion of the shares of voting preferred) of our issued and outstanding voting securities as of that date. The series of preferred represented by the 20,000 shares of voting preferred is convertible into an aggregate of 666,666 shares of our common stock.. Pursuant to a Board Representation and Standstill Agreement entered into in connection with LSB Funding's purchase of preferred stock in December 2015, LSB Funding has the right to designate two directors on our Board, and the Golsen Holders have the right to appoint two directors as amended in October 2017, subject to reduction in each case in certain circumstances.  This is in addition to their ability to vote generally in the election of directors.  As a result, each of LSB Funding and the Golsen Holders have significant influence over the election of directors to our Board.. The interests of LSB Funding and the Golsen Holders may conflict with interests of other stockholders (as well as with each other).  As a result of the voting power and board designation rights of LSB Funding and the Golsen Holders, the ability of other stockholders to influence our management and policies could be limited.. We are subject to a variety of factors that could discourage other parties from attempting to acquire us.. Our certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered Board and, except in limited circumstances, a two-thirds vote of outstanding voting shares to approve a merger, consolidation or sale of all, or substantially all, of our assets.  In addition, we have entered into severance agreements with our executive officers and some of the executive officers of certain subsidiaries that provide, among other things, that if, within a specified period of time after the occurrence of a change in control of LSB, these officers are terminated, other than for cause, or the officer terminates his employment for good reason, the officer would be entitled to certain severance benefits.  Certain of our preferred stock series and debt instruments also provide special rights in a change of control, including in some cases the ability to be repaid in full or redeemed.. We have authorized and unissued (including shares held in treasury) 46,381,342 shares of common stock and 4,090,231 shares of preferred stock as of December 31, 2017.  These unissued shares could be used by our management to make it more difficult, and thereby discourage an attempt to acquire control of us.. We have adopted a preferred share purchase plan, which is designed to protect us against certain creeping acquisitions, open market purchases and certain mergers and other combinations with acquiring companies.. The foregoing provisions and agreements are designed to discourage a third-party tender offer, proxy contest, or other attempts to acquire control of us and could have the effect of making it more difficult to remove incumbent management.  In addition, LSB Funding and the Golsen Holders have significant voting power and rights to designate board representatives, all of which may further discourage a third-party tender offer, proxy contest, or other attempts to acquire control of us.. Delaware has adopted an anti-takeover law which, among other things, will delay for three years business combinations with acquirers of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of publicly-held companies (such as us), unless:. •  prior to such time the Board of the corporation approved the business combination that results in the stockholder becoming an invested stockholder;. •  the acquirer owned at least 85% of the outstanding voting stock of such company prior to commencement of the transaction;. •  two-thirds of the stockholders, other than the acquirer, vote to approve the business combination after approval thereof by the Board; or. •  the stockholders of the corporation amend its articles of incorporation or by-laws electing not to be governed by this provision.. 18.
