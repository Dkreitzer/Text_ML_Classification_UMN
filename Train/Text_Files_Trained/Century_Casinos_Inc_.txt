[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors.. <U+FEFF>. Our short and long-term success is subject to many factors beyond our control. If any of the following risks, or any risks described elsewhere in or incorporated by reference in this report, actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Risks Related to our Business and Operations. <U+FEFF>. We face significant competition, and if we are not able to compete successfully, our results of operations will be harmed.. <U+FEFF>. We face intense competition from other casinos in jurisdictions in which we operate. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater name recognition and financial and marketing resources than we do. We seek to compete through promotion of our players' clubs and other marketing efforts. For example, for CRA, we emphasize the casino's showroom, complimentary heated parking, players' club program, and superior service. These marketing efforts may not be successful, which could hurt our competitive position.. <U+FEFF>. The markets in which we operate are generally not destination resort areas and rely on a local customer base as well as tourists during peak seasons. The number of casinos in our markets may exceed demand, which could make it difficult for us to sustain profitability. New or expanded operations by other entities in any of the markets in which we operate will increase competition for our gaming operations and could have a material adverse impact on us. We are particularly vulnerable to competition in Colorado and Poland due to the large number of competitors in those markets. Internet gaming or other gaming opportunities that become available in our markets could also attract players that might otherwise have visited our casinos. At the end of 2016, the gaming law in Poland was changed to permit Internet gaming and slot arcades through a state run company, effective April 2017. The changes have not yet been implemented. We expect online gaming and the slot arcades to begin operating in 2018. Once they begin operations, these changes could increase competition and adversely affect our results of operations. Capital expenditures, such as those for new gaming equipment, room refurbishments and amenity upgrades may be necessary from time to time to preserve the competitiveness of our properties. If we are not successful in making these improvements, our facilities may be less attractive to our visitors than those of our competitors, which could have a negative impact on our business.. <U+FEFF>. We face extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities, which involve considerable expense and could harm our business.. <U+FEFF>. As owners and operators of gaming facilities, we are subject to extensive state, local, and international provincial regulation. State, local and provincial authorities require us and our subsidiaries to demonstrate suitability to obtain and retain various licenses and require that we have registrations, permits and approvals to conduct gaming operations. Various regulatory authorities may, for any reason set forth in applicable legislation, rules and regulations, limit, condition, suspend or revoke a license or registration to conduct gaming operations or prevent us from owning the securities of any of our gaming subsidiaries. Like all gaming operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate or plan to operate, we must periodically apply to renew our gaming licenses or registrations and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees approved. At CRA and CAL, our licenses must be renewed every five years, with the next renewals scheduled for 2018. At Century Downs and St. Albert and in Colorado, our licenses must be renewed every two years, with the next renewals scheduled for 2018 for Century Downs and St. Albert and 2019 for Central City and Cripple Creek. In Poland, gaming licenses are granted for six year periods and are not renewable. When a gaming license in Poland expires, any gaming company can apply for the license and there can be no guarantee that we will be granted a new license at our existing casinos. The licenses for our Lodz and Plock casinos expired in February 2018, the license for our Krakow casino expires in March 2018, and the license for our Poznan casino expires in April 2018. We may not be able to obtain license renewals or approvals of new licenses. Regulatory authorities may also levy substantial fines against us or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating gaming laws or regulations. Any of these events could force us to terminate operations at an existing gaming facility, either on a temporary or permanent basis, could result in us being fined or could prohibit us from successfully completing a project in which we invest. Closing facilities or an inability to expand may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. 18. In addition to gaming regulations, we are also subject to various federal, state, provincial, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Rules and regulations regarding the service of alcoholic beverages are strict. The loss or suspension of a liquor license could significantly impair our operations.. <U+FEFF>. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violations of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted.. <U+FEFF>. Potential changes in the regulatory environment may adversely affect the results of our operations.. <U+FEFF>. From time to time, legislators and special interest groups have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations or that may otherwise adversely impact our operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any expansion of the gaming industry that results in increased competition and any restriction on or prohibition of our gaming operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cause us to record an impairment of our assets. In Poland, changes to the gaming law that went into effect in April 2017, but have not yet been implemented, legalized online gaming and reintroduced slot arcades that will be operated through a state run company. We expect the online gaming and slot arcades to begin operating in 2018. Once they begin operation, these changes could increase competition and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, there is uncertainty surrounding future legislative changes that the U.S. Congress could impose relating to gaming, including potential changes to online gaming or sports betting laws. Any newly adopted gaming laws in the U.S. or other jurisdictions in which we operate could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. The enactment of legislation implementing changes in the U.S. taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform laws or policies could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. We are subject to taxation at the federal, state, provincial and local levels in the U.S. and various other countries and jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. From time to time, the U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\") was enacted on December 22, 2017 and included significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, including, among other items, a reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred, and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign earnings. These changes are complex and will require the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") to issue interpretations and regulations that may significantly impact how the Tax Act is applied and ultimately may impact our results of operations.  If there are significant interpretations and regulations issued related to the Tax Act that would increase the tax rates on future U.S. or foreign earnings, these changes could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. 19. We face extensive taxation from gaming and regulatory authorities. Potential changes to the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the results of our operations.. <U+FEFF>. We believe that the prospect of significant revenue to a jurisdiction through taxation and fees is one of the primary reasons jurisdictions permit legalized gaming. As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state, provincial and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. For instance, the Colorado constitution permits a gaming tax of up to 40% on adjusted gross gaming proceeds. The current gaming tax in Colorado established by the Colorado Gaming Commission is a graduated rate of 0.25% to 20% on adjusted gross gaming proceeds, where casinos pay a higher percentage as their adjusted gross proceeds increase. At our Edmonton, St. Albert and Calgary casinos, the AGLC retains 85% of slot machine net sales, of which the AGLC allocates 15% to licensed charities and 70% to the Alberta Lottery Fund. For all table games in Alberta, Canada, excluding poker and craps, we are required to allocate 50% of our net win to a charity designated by the AGLC, with the exception of our St. Albert casino, for which we are required to allocate 35% of our net win to a charity designated by the AGLC. For poker and craps in Alberta, Canada, we are required to allocate 25% of our net win to the charity. At Century Downs, the AGLC and HRA retain 56.25% of slot machine net sales, which are allocated to and used by the Alberta Lottery Fund and by HRA to fund purses, marketing, administration and animal welfare and other programs. Any change to the agreement between the AGLC and HRA on the division of the slot machine net sales at Century Downs could negatively impact our revenue, as HRA may increase the amount it retains in order to offset increased retention from the AGLC. The Polish Minister of Finance assesses a gaming tax rate on gross gaming revenue of 50%. In Poland, under legislation enacted in late 2017 and effective in January 2018, casino patrons winning over PLN 2,280 in a single casino visit are now subject to personal income tax on their winnings, which could adversely affect our casino patronage and our results of operations. In addition, negative economic conditions could intensify the efforts of federal, state, provincial and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes or introduction of additional gaming opportunities.. <U+FEFF>. We may be unable to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations or potential acquisitions.. <U+FEFF>. Our industry is capital intensive, and we rely heavily on the ability of our casinos to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing, fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future development. While we have a significant amount of cash currently on hand, we may not be able to obtain funding when we need it on favorable terms or at all. We are currently constructing the Century Mile horse racing facility in the Edmonton market area, which we estimate will cost approximately CAD 60.0 million  ($47.8 million based on the exchange rate in effect as of December 31, 2017). We plan to finance this project with $25.0 million received from an equity offering in November 2017, loans under our existing or additional credit facilities and available cash. If we are unable to finance our current or future expansion projects, such as the Century Mile, Saw Close Casino Ltd., and Cripple Creek Palace Hotel projects, we will have to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expansion, development and renovation projects and capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, obtaining additional equity financing or joint venture partners, or modifying our bank credit facility. In addition, the amount of capital that we are able to raise often depends on variables that are beyond our control, such as the share price of our stock and its trading volume. The availability of financing may be impacted by local, regional and global economic, credit and stock market conditions, all of which have been volatile. As a result, we may not be able to secure financing on terms attractive to us, in a timely manner or at all. If we are able to consummate a financing arrangement, the amount raised may not be sufficient to meet all of our future needs and, if it involves equity, may be highly dilutive to our stockholders. If we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements, we may have to reduce, dispose of or eliminate certain operations.. <U+FEFF>. Our financing agreements in Canada impose restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility, and a default could have a material adverse effect on us.. <U+FEFF>. Our various credit agreements require us to adhere to a number of significant financial covenants and for the Company to guaranty the debt of our subsidiaries. These restrictions limit the ability of our subsidiaries in Canada to incur additional debt, obtain future financings to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. A breach of any covenant in any of our credit agreements would result in an event of default under that agreement after any applicable grace periods. An event of default, if not waived or cured, could cause the lender to accelerate the repayment of all outstanding amounts due under the agreement, foreclose on the security granted under the agreement and enforce the Company's obligations under its guarantee. There can be no assurances that we or our subsidiaries would be able to obtain a waiver of an event of default or modification of a covenant if necessary, or otherwise obtain alternative sources of funding to repay the obligation if a default occurred. Any such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on us.. <U+FEFF>. 20. Difficulties in managing our worldwide operations may have an adverse impact on our business.. <U+FEFF>. We derive our revenue principally from operations located on two continents and on cruise ships operating around the world. Our management is located in the United States and Europe. Our worldwide operations pose risks to our business, especially for a smaller company such as ours. Risks associated with international operations include:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifferent time zones;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tculture, management and language differences;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in laws and policies that govern our foreign operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpossible failure to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulty in establishing staffing and managing non-United States operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifferent labor regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in environmental, health and safety laws;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teconomic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tuncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures.. <U+FEFF>. These factors make it more challenging to manage and administer a globally-dispersed business and, as a result, we must devote greater resources to operating under several regulatory and legislative regimes (See \"Governmental Regulation and Licensing\" in Item 1, \"Business\"). This business model also increases our costs.. 21. We may experience construction delays during our expansion or development projects, including the development and construction costs associated with the Century Mile project in Edmonton and the Saw Close Casino project in Bath, which could adversely affect our operations.. <U+FEFF>. From time to time we may commence construction projects at our properties. Construction on the Century Mile project in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada commenced in July 2017, and we expect to open the REC in early 2019. Construction on the Saw Close Casino project in Bath, England commenced in October 2017, and we expect to open the casino in the second quarter of 2018. We may engage in additional construction projects in the future. Construction projects entail significant risks, which can substantially increase costs or delay completion of a project. Most of these factors are beyond our control.. <U+FEFF>. Our current and future projects could also experience:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure to obtain necessary licenses, permits, entitlements or other governmental approvals;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges to plans and specifications (some of which may require the approval of regulatory agencies);.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelays and significant cost increases;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshortages of materials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshortages of skilled labor or work stoppages for contractors and subcontractors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlabor disputes or work stoppages;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thealth and safety incidents and site accidents;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tengineering problems, including defective plans and specifications;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpoor performance or nonperformance by our partners or other third parties on whom we place reliance;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations, applicable to gaming and other facilities, real estate development or construction projects;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunforeseen construction scheduling, engineering, environmental, permitting, construction or geological problems;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenvironmental issues, including the discovery of unknown environmental contamination;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tweather interference, floods, fires or other casualty losses; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother unanticipated circumstances or cost increases.. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF>. The occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs of our construction projects, including the Century Mile or Saw Close Casino projects, or delay or prevent the construction or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of our construction projects. This could materially adversely affect our plan of operations, financial condition and ability to satisfy our debt obligations. In addition, construction at our operating casinos may disrupt our customers' experience and cause a decline in our revenue.. <U+FEFF>. Actual costs and construction periods for any of our projects can differ significantly from initial expectations. We can provide no assurance that we will complete any project on time, if at all, or within established budgets, or that any project will result in increased earnings to us. If our initial budgets are not accurate, we may need to pursue additional financing to complete a proposed project, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. The adverse impact on our results of operations resulting from cost overruns on any construction projects we undertake may harm our stock prices.. <U+FEFF>. We intend to develop and operate additional properties in the future and if our development efforts are not successful, our business may be adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. We regularly review opportunities to develop new properties. We may not be successful in obtaining the rights to develop such properties, and as a result, we may incur significant costs for which we will receive no return. Even if we are successful in obtaining the rights to develop new casino properties, commencing operations at new casino projects may require substantial development capital. Additional risks before commencing operations include the time and expense incurred and unforeseen difficulties in obtaining suitable sites, liquor licenses, building permits, materials, competent and able contractors, supplies, employees, gaming devices and related matters.. <U+FEFF>. We may engage in construction projects as part of our development of additional properties in the future. Construction projects entail significant risks, which can substantially increase costs or delay completion of a project. Most of these factors are beyond our control. The occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs of our construction projects or delay or prevent the construction or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of our construction projects. This could materially adversely affect our plan of operations, financial condition and ability to satisfy our debt obligations.. <U+FEFF>. 22. Development activities such as the Century Mile and SCCL projects involve substantial risks, such as uncertainties regarding our ability to secure various licenses, permits and government authorizations, and expenses related to such activities, as well as the risks of potential cost over-runs, construction delays and market deterioration.. <U+FEFF>. We may pursue gaming opportunities that would require us to obtain a gaming license. While our management believes that we are licensable in any jurisdiction that allows gaming operations, each licensing process is unique and requires a significant amount of funds and management time. The licensing process in any particular jurisdiction can take significant time and expense through licensing fees, background investigation costs, legal fees and other associated preparation costs. Moreover, if we proceed with a licensing approval process with industry partners, such industry partners would be subject to regulatory review as well. We seek to find industry partners that are licensable, but cannot assure that such partners will, in fact, be licensable. Certain licenses include competitive situations where, even if we and our industry partners are licensable, other factors such as the economic impact of gaming, financial and operational capabilities of competitors must be analyzed by regulatory authorities. In addition, political factors may make the licensing process more difficult. If any of our gaming license applications are denied, we may have to write off costs related to our investment in such application processes, which could be significant. In addition, our ability to attract and retain competent management and employees for any new location is critical to our success. One or more of these risks may result in any new gaming opportunity not being successful. If we are not able to successfully commence operations at these properties, our results of operations may be adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. Our reputation and business may be harmed by cyber security breaches, and we may be subject to legal claims if there is loss, disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our customers', our business partners' or our own information or other breaches of our information security.. <U+FEFF>. We make use of online services and centralized data processing, including through third party service providers. The secure maintenance and transmission of customer information, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for marketing and promotional purposes, is a critical element of our operations. Our collection and use of personal data are governed by state and federal privacy laws as well as the applicable laws in other countries in which we operate. Compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our guests.. <U+FEFF>. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit customer information, or those of service providers, or our employee or business information may be compromised by a malicious third party penetration of our network security, or that of a third party service provider or business partner, or by actions or inactions by our employees. As a result, information of our customers, third party service providers or business partners or our employee or business information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without their or our consent. Non-compliance with applicable privacy regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third parties engaged by us) or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in a loss of customers and subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data. Our insurance does not cover cyber security incidents. The loss, disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may adversely affect our businesses, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, a cyber security breach could have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our businesses, operating results and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. 23. We may be adversely affected by reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of consumer concerns over economic conditions, homeland security, terrorism and war.. <U+FEFF>. Our business may be adversely affected by international, national and local economic and political conditions. From time to time, the volatile global economic environment has had negative effects on our business because our business is largely impacted by discretionary consumer spending. Reductions in discretionary consumer spending or changes in consumer preferences brought about by factors such as increased unemployment, perceived or actual deterioration in general economic conditions, housing market instability, perceived or actual decline in disposable consumer income and wealth, and changes in consumer confidence in the economy could reduce customer demand for the leisure activities we offer and may adversely affect our revenue and operating cash flow. For example, Alberta, is Canada's largest oil and gas producer and a decrease in oil and gas prices could create higher unemployment and reduce discretionary consumer spending at our Canadian casinos.. <U+FEFF>. Terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties and have had a negative impact on travel and leisure expenditures, including gaming, lodging and tourism. For example, our locations in Poland are in close proximity to Ukraine and Russia. While we have not experienced any material impact from the acts of hostility between the two countries, an increase in those hostilities could adversely affect our casinos in Poland. We cannot predict the extent to which terrorism, security alerts or war, or hostilities in countries throughout the world will directly or indirectly affect our business and operating results, but the impact could be material.. <U+FEFF>. Insufficient or lower-than-expected results generated from our new developments and acquired properties may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. Our acquisitions and new developments may not generate revenues that will be sufficient to pay related expenses, or, even if such revenues are sufficient to pay related expenses, the acquisitions and new developments may not yield an adequate return or any return on our significant investments. In addition, generating returns on acquisitions and new investments may take significantly longer than we expect and may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. New facilities also may compete with existing facilities that we own and operate.. <U+FEFF>. Inclement weather and other conditions could seriously disrupt our business, which may hamper our financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. The operations of our facilities are subject to disruptions or reductions in the number of customers who visit our properties because of severe weather conditions. If weather conditions limit access to our casino properties or otherwise adversely impact our ability to operate our casinos at full capacity, our revenue will suffer, which will negatively impact our operating results. High winds, flooding, blizzards and sub-zero temperatures, such as those experienced in Colorado and Alberta from time to time, can limit access to our properties.. <U+FEFF>. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer, our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain the same insurance coverage in the future.. <U+FEFF>. We may suffer damage to our property caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism), that could severely disrupt our business or subject us to claims by third parties who are injured or harmed. Although we maintain insurance customary in our industry, including property, casualty, terrorism and business interruption insurance, that insurance is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits, including limitations on the coverage period for business interruption. Due to these variables, we may not be able to fully insure such losses, or fully collect, if at all, on claims resulting from severe weather conditions. The lack of sufficient insurance for these types of acts could expose us to heavy losses if any damages occur, directly or indirectly, that could have a significant adverse impact on our operations.. <U+FEFF>. We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage or self-insure. Among other factors, regional political tensions, homeland security concerns, other catastrophic events or any change in government legislation governing insurance coverage for acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in increased premiums on available coverage (which may cause us to elect to reduce our policy limits), additional exclusions from coverage or higher deductibles. Among other potential future adverse changes, in the future we may elect to not, or may not be able to, obtain any coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism.. <U+FEFF>. 24. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be harmed by work stoppages and other labor issues.. <U+FEFF>. There are 243 employees at our CPL casinos in Poland who belong to trade unions. The trade unions do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with CPL but changes in pay for union employees at CPL require approval from the trade unions. A lengthy strike or other work stoppage at our casino properties in Poland could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our employees in the U.S. and Canada and in our Corporate and Other segment are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. From time to time, we have experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non-union employees. If a union seeks to organize any of our employees, we could experience disruption in our business and incur significant costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. If a union were successful in organizing any of our employees, we could experience significant increases in our labor costs which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates and currency controls in foreign countries could adversely affect our business.. <U+FEFF>. Our casinos in Canada and Poland represent a significant portion of our business, and the revenue generated and expenses incurred by these operations are generally denominated in Canadian dollars and Polish zloty, respectively. Decreases in the value of these currencies in relation to the value of the U.S. dollar have decreased the operating profit from our foreign operations when translated into U.S. dollars, which has adversely affected our consolidated results of operations, and such decreases may occur in the future. In addition, we may expand our operations into other countries and, accordingly, we could face similar exchange rate risk with respect to the costs of doing business in such countries as a result of any increases in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the currencies of such countries. We do not currently hedge our exposure to fluctuations of these foreign currencies, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully hedge any future foreign currency exposure.. <U+FEFF>. We have invested $1.0 million in capital in the MCE project located in Argentina. In addition, we have a Consulting Services Agreement with MCE in which CCE is receiving a service fee consisting of a fixed fee plus a percentage of MCE's EBITDA. Argentina has implemented currency controls within the country that could limit our ability to repatriate our initial capital, the consulting service fee, or other funds.. <U+FEFF>. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us.. <U+FEFF>. We are highly dependent on the services of Erwin Haitzmann and Peter Hoetzinger, our Co-Chief Executive Officers, and other members of our senior management team. The employment agreements with Erwin Haitzmann and Peter Hoetzinger provide that, under some circumstances, the departure of one executive could allow the other to leave for cause. Our ability to retain key personnel is affected by the competitiveness of our compensation packages and the other terms and conditions of employment, our continued ability to compete effectively against other gaming companies and our growth prospects. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. We may be required in the future to record impairment losses related to assets we currently carry on our balance sheet.. <U+FEFF>. We have $275 million of tangible and intangible assets, including $15 million of goodwill, $15 million in casino licenses, $2 million in trademarks and $153 million in property and equipment as of December 31, 2017. Accounting rules require that we make certain estimates and assumptions related to our determinations as to the future recoverability of these assets. If we were to determine that the values of these assets carried on our balance sheet are impaired due to adverse changes in our business or otherwise, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the value of these assets, which would adversely affect our results during the period in which we recorded the impairment charge.. <U+FEFF>. 25. We are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. From time to time, we are defendants in various lawsuits and gaming regulatory proceedings relating to matters incidental to our business. As with all litigation, no assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these matters and, in general, litigation can be expensive and time consuming. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of our current or future legal proceedings, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. In Poland, tax laws and other Polish laws and regulations change from time to time, sometimes with no reference to established regulations or cases. The current Polish laws and regulations also have ambiguities that lead to differences in interpretations between authorities and between authorities and companies. Taxes or other payments may frequently be inspected by Polish authorities that are authorized to impose significant fines, extra liabilities and interest for underpayments. As a result, our tax risk is higher in Poland than in countries with better-developed tax systems. Since Polish tax payments may be inspected for up to five years, the amounts included in our financial statements for Polish taxes may change at a later date after the final amounts are determined, and other Polish laws and regulations may lead to additional liabilities. We have open tax audits currently in litigation with the Polish Internal Revenue Service (\"Polish IRS\"), as described further in Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\". The Supreme Administrative Court in Poland found in favor of the Polish IRS in 2016 regarding certain open tax audits, and we are awaiting a decision from the Supreme Administrative Court relating to another open tax audit. Additional tax obligations as a result of the tax audits by the Polish IRS could adversely affect our financial position.. <U+FEFF>. We are dependent upon technology services and electrical power to operate our business, and if we experience damage or service interruptions, we may have to cease some or all of our operations, resulting in a decrease in revenue.. <U+FEFF>. Our gaming operations rely heavily on technology services and an uninterrupted supply of electrical power. Our security system and all of our slot machines are controlled by computers and reliant on electrical power to operate. A loss of electrical power or a failure of the technology services needed to run the computers would make us unable to run all or parts of our gaming operations. Any unscheduled interruption in our technology services or interruption in the supply of electrical power is likely to result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenue due to a shutdown of our gaming operations. Although we have designed our systems around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events. Additionally, substantial increases in the cost of electricity and natural gas could negatively affect our results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. 26. Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other similar anti-corruption laws could have a negative impact on us.. <U+FEFF>. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing cross-border business and in each of the countries in which we transact business. We are subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties, and the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. Risks Related to Our Common Stock. <U+FEFF>. Our stock price has been volatile and may decline significantly and unexpectedly.. <U+FEFF>. Our common stock trades in the U.S. on the Nasdaq Capital Market, which consists of relatively small issuers and a lack of significant trading volumes relative to other U.S. markets. These factors may result in volatility in the price of our common stock. For instance, the trading price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market in 2016 and 2017 varied from a high of $9.85 to a low of $5.34.. <U+FEFF>. Certain anti-takeover measures we have adopted may limit our ability to consummate transactions that some of our security holders might otherwise support.. <U+FEFF>. We have a fair price business combination provision in our certificate of incorporation, which requires approval of certain business combinations and other transactions by holders of 80% of our outstanding shares of voting stock. In addition, our certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval. These provisions generally have the effect of requiring that any party seeking to acquire us negotiate with our board of directors in order to structure a business combination with us. This may have the effect of depressing the price of our common stock due to the possibility that certain transactions that our stockholders might favor could be precluded by these provisions.. <U+FEFF>. Regulation Risk Related to Stockholders. <U+FEFF>. Stockholders may be required to dispose of their shares of our common stock if they are found unsuitable by U.S. gaming authorities.. <U+FEFF>. Gaming authorities in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom generally can require that any beneficial owner of our common stock and other securities file an application for a finding of suitability. If a gaming authority requires a record or beneficial owner of our securities to file a suitability application, the owner must apply for a finding of suitability within 30 days or at an earlier time prescribed by the gaming authority. The gaming authority has the power to investigate an owner's suitability, and the owner must pay all costs of the investigation. If the owner is found unsuitable, then the owner may be required by law to dispose of our securities. Our certificate of incorporation also provides us with the right to repurchase shares of our common stock from certain beneficial owners declared by gaming regulators to be unsuitable holders of our equity securities, and the price we pay to any such beneficial owner may be below the price such beneficial owner would otherwise accept for his or her shares of our common stock.. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>"
