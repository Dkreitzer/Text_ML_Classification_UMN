[1] "ITEM 1A.        RISK FACTORS. You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included and incorporated by reference in this Annual Report, including the risk factors listed below. Any of these risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the trading price of shares of our common stock. Additional risks not currently known or currently material to us may also harm our business.. We have historically derived a significant portion of our royalty revenues from Genentech and other Queen et al. patent licensees which, in the case of our largest licensee, Genentech, expired in early 2016. Failure to acquire additional sources of revenue, including new product acquisitions and royalty revenue, after expiration of our Queen et al. patents and the related licenses may cause us to have insufficient revenues and positive cash flows to continue operations.. Our revenues through the first quarter of 2016 consisted almost entirely of royalties from licensees of our Queen et al. patents. Of this revenue from licensees of the Queen et al. patents accounted for 11%, 68% and 82% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our license agreement with Genentech expired in the first quarter of 2016, and our other licensees, and efforts to identify and replace those sources of revenues in the future might not be successful. Failure to replace Queen et al. patent license revenues in an amount sufficient to continue our operations would have a material adverse effect on our business.. Prospectively, we expect to focus on the acquisition of additional products and except to transact fewer royalty transactions and still fewer debt transactions. We anticipate that over time more of our revenues will come from our Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices segments and less of our revenues will come from our Income Generating Assets segment. We do not expect that acquisitions assets under these segments will, in the near term, fully replace the revenues we have generated from our license agreements related to the Queen et al. patents. Specifically, after the first quarter of 2016, our revenues materially decreased after we stopped receiving significant payments from these Queen et al. patents license agreements and related legal settlements. Our continued success will become more dependent on the timing and our ability to acquire assets in our Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices segments to generate revenues going forward to support our business model. We may be unable to acquire or develop sufficient pharmaceutical products, medical devices and/or income generating assets for a number of reasons, including the fact that the acquisition of new products, royalty revenues or other income generating assets in the healthcare industry is a highly competitive area in which other companies, financial institutions and private funds compete for assets of interest to us. Those entities may have access to lower costs of capital, strategic opportunities or competitive advantages that may not be available to us. Other factors that may prevent us from acquiring additional pharmaceutical products, medical devices and/or favorable income generating assets include the following:. • we may be unable to acquire additional pharmaceutical products, medical devices and/or income generating assets on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate level of return from the asset;. • our products and asset investments may be less successful in the marketplace than may be necessary to generate an appropriate level of return from the asset; or. • we may be forced to undertake more risk in obtaining the assets we pursue.. If we are unable to acquire additional pharmaceutical products, medical devices and/or suitable income generating assets our business may suffer and we may determine that a wind-down, sale, or liquidation is in the best interests of our stockholders.. Any difficulties from strategic acquisitions could adversely affect our stock price and results of operations.. We may acquire companies, businesses and products that complement or augment our existing business. We may not be able to integrate any acquired business successfully or operate any acquired business profitably. Integrating any newly acquired business. 23. could be expensive and time-consuming. Integration efforts often take a significant amount of time, place a significant strain on managerial, operational and financial resources and could prove to be more difficult or expensive than we predict. The diversion of our management's attention and any delay or difficulties encountered in connection with any future acquisitions we may consummate could result in the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards and controls that could negatively affect our ability to maintain third party relationships. Moreover, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing, or issue additional shares, to acquire any businesses or products, which may result in dilution for stockholders or the incurrence of indebtedness.. Our investment in Noden is our first investment in support of commercial products rather than an investment in financial assets or royalties for income generation. Our returns from the investment in Noden are dependent upon the success of the acquired prescription pharmaceutical products sold under the brand names Tekturna, Tekturna HCT, Rasilez and Rasilez HCT and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attain and maintain significant market acceptance of our products among physicians, patients, third party payors and others in the health care community. Further, our acquisition of 100% of the equity interests in LENSAR is our first acquisition in support of our Medical Device segment. Our revenues from our Medical Device segment consist entirely of sales of the LENSAR laser system. There can be no assurance that we will be able successfully develop and expand these systems on a commercial scale.. We are dependent upon Noden and its management team for sales in our Pharmaceutical segment, and LENSAR and its management team for sales in Medical Device segment, in each case in gaining and maintaining acceptance among physicians, third party payors, patients and others in the health care community for our products or devices.. Continued market acceptance of any approved product depends on a number of other factors, including:. • the receipt of regulatory clearance of marketing claims for the uses that we may in the future develop;. • the establishment and demonstration of the advantages and safety of our laser technology;. • pricing and reimbursement policies of government and third party payers such as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other health plan administrators;. • the effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts.. Noden has limited commercial experience and is undertaking the commercialization of the Noden Products with a new contract sales force in the United States and no current commercial infrastructure outside the United States. Our revenues from the investment in Noden depend on Noden's ability to successfully transition the Noden Products to a new commercial team, the failure of which could have an adverse impact on our revenues, could lead to an impairment charge of our long-lived assets and could have an adverse impact on the value of our investment in Noden.. In addition, the supply agreement with Novartis commits Noden to minimum purchase obligation of the Noden Products, which may result in excess inventory if Noden's new commercial team is not able to sell the Noden Products at sufficient levels to cover the minimum purchase obligations. If we experience excess inventory, it may be necessary to write down or even write off such excess inventory, which could adversely affect our operating results.. Through our investment in Noden, we have a significant investment in the commercialization of products worldwide, and our returns on investment on the Noden Products are subject to a number of risks associated with international operations that could materially and adversely affect our business.. As a result of our acquisition of the Noden Products through our investment in Noden, we expect to be subject to a number of risks related to the sale of products worldwide, including:. • international regulatory requirements for drug marketing and pricing in foreign countries;. • varied standards of care in various countries that could complicate the commercial success of products;. • varied drug import and export rules;. • varying standards for the protection of intellectual property rights which may result in reduced or compromised exclusivity in certain countries;. • unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;. • varied reimbursement systems and different competitive drugs indicated to treat the indications for which Noden Products are being commercialized;. • economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;. • compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws applicable to foreign operations;. 24. • compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), the UK Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws;. • foreign taxes and duties;. • foreign currency fluctuations and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;. • workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;. • reliance on management, contract services organizations and other third parties that may be less experienced with manufacturing and commercialization than the party from whom the Noden Products were acquired;. • potential liability resulting from product liability laws or the activities of foreign distributors; and. • business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters.. In addition, our international operations could be affected by currency fluctuations, capital and exchange controls, expropriation and other restrictive government actions as well as by political unrest, unstable governments and legal systems and inter-governmental disputes. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our business.. We rely on third party manufacturers to manufacture our products, and these third parties may not perform adequately.. We do not have any operating manufacturing facilities for Noden Products at this time, and do not expect to independently manufacture our products or any future products under the Pharmaceutical segment. We currently rely on Novartis for a specified period of time to manufacture and package the Noden Products, and are required thereafter to identify and transition to third parties to scale-up, manufacture and supply the Noden Products. The facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our drug products must be approved by the FDA pursuant to the approved NDA and are subject to FDA inspection for our drug and medical devices. We do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with the regulatory requirements, known as current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements for manufacture of our drug and device products. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not authorize these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such authorization in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our business and results of operations.. Other risks arising from reliance on third party manufacturers include:. • inability to identify and enter into a manufacturing and supply agreement with a third party manufacturer having the appropriate capabilities to cost-effectively and timely manufacture products at the sales levels that we anticipate;. • reduced control and additional burdens of oversight as a result of using third party manufacturers for all aspects of manufacturing activities, including regulatory compliance and quality control and assurance;. • termination or non-renewal of manufacturing and supply agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that may negatively impact commercialization activities; and. • disruption in the operations of third party manufacturers or suppliers unrelated to our products, including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier or a catastrophic event affecting the third manufacturers or suppliers.. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products. In addition, if any third party manufacturer terminates its engagement with us or fails to perform as agreed, we may be required to find replacement manufacturers, which would result in significant cost and delay.. In addition, difficulties or delays in product manufacturing and reliance on third party manufacturing could affect our future results reflected in the performance of Noden and the Noden Products by virtue of regulatory actions, shut-downs, approval delays, withdrawals, recalls, penalties, supply disruptions or shortages or force majeure events, reputational harm, product liability, unanticipated costs or otherwise. Examples of such difficulties or delays include, but are not limited to, the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand; the possibility that the supply of incoming materials may be delayed or become unavailable or be subject to increased costs and that the quality of incoming materials may be substandard and not detected; the possibility that third party manufacturers may fail to maintain appropriate quality standards throughout the internal and external supply network and/or comply with cGMPs and other applicable regulations such as tracking and tracing of products in the supply chain to enhance patient safety; risks to supply chain continuity as a result of natural or man-made disasters at a supplier or vendor; or failure to maintain the integrity of the supply chains against intentional and criminal acts such as economic adulteration, product diversion, product theft, and counterfeit goods.. 25. Product sales are expected to generate a significant share of our revenues in the future and are subject to the risks and uncertainties of branded pharmaceutical products.. If our products become subject to problems such as changes in prescription growth rates, product liability litigation, unexpected side effects, regulatory proceedings, manufacturing issues, publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence, pressure from existing competitive products, changes in labeling, loss of patent protection (when applicable), or, if a new, more effective treatment should be introduced, the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant.. We depend upon a limited number of wholesalers for a significant portion of our revenues from the Noden Products, and the loss of, or significant reduction in sales to, any one of these wholesalers could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.. We sell the Noden Products primarily to wholesalers. Wholesalers sell the Noden Products to hospitals and physician offices. We do not promote the Noden Products to wholesalers, and they do not set or determine demand for Noden Products. Our ability to successfully commercialize Noden Products will depend, in part, on the extent to which we are able to provide adequate distribution of the Noden Products to patients. Although we have contracted with a number of wholesalers, they are expected generally to carry a very limited inventory and may be reluctant to be part of our distribution network in the future if demand for the product does not increase.. The use of pharmaceutical wholesalers involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these pharmaceutical wholesalers will not provide us accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, demand from wholesaler customers buying the Noden Products or complaints about the Noden Products, that these wholesalers will reduce their efforts or discontinue to sell or support or otherwise not effectively sell or support the Noden Products, or not devote the resources necessary to sell the Noden Products in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect.. Further, it is possible that these wholesalers could decide to change their policies or fees, or both, at some time in the future. This could result in their refusal to carry smaller volume products such as Noden Products, or lower margins or the need to find alternative methods of distributing the Noden Products. Although we believe we can find alternative channels to distribute the Noden Products on relatively short notice, our revenue during that period of time may suffer and we may incur additional costs to replace any such wholesaler. The loss of any large wholesaler as part of our distribution network, a significant reduction in sales we make to wholesalers, or any failure to pay for the Noden Products we have shipped to them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.. We have significantly restructured our business and revised our business plan, including entering into a new segment reporting structure. Our three industry segments designated as Income Generating Assets, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices, and our restructured business plan, have been in effect for a limited period of time and there are no assurances that we will be able to successfully implement our business plan or successfully operate in our Pharmaceutical or Medical Devices segments.. From 2012 to 2016 we focused on acquiring income generating assets when such assets can be acquired on terms that we believe allow us to increase return to our stockholders. Currently and prospectively, we expect to focus on the acquisition of additional products and devices in our Pharmaceutical and Medical Device segments, respectively, and expect to transact fewer royalty transactions and debt transactions under our Income Generating Assets segment. We anticipate that over time more of our revenues will come from our Pharmaceutical and Medical Device segments and less of our revenues will come from our Income Generating Assets segment. Our strategy is based on a number of factors and assumptions, some of which are not within our control, such as the actions of third parties. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute all or any elements of our strategy, or that our ability to successfully execute our strategy will be unaffected by external factors. If we are unsuccessful in growing our product sales business or our medical device sales business as planned, our financial performance could be adversely affected.. Our current and future acquisitions of other material products, medical devices and/or income generating assets may not produce anticipated revenues, and if such transactions are secured by collateral, we may be, or may become, under-secured by the collateral or such collateral may lose value and we will not be able recuperate our capital expenditures in the acquisition.. We are engaged in a continual review of opportunities to acquire pharmaceutical products, medical devices and/or income generating assets, whether royalty-based or otherwise, or to acquire companies who own or are acquiring pharmaceutical products. 26. or medical devices, or that hold royalty or other income generating assets. We currently, and generally at any time, have acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review, including, for example, our engagement of consultants and advisors to analyze particular opportunities, technical, financial and other confidential information, submission of indications of interest and involvement as a bidder in competitive auctions or other processes for the acquisition of pharmaceutical products, devices and/or income generating assets. Many potential acquisition targets do not meet our criteria, and for those that do, we may face significant competition for these acquisitions from other financial investors and enterprises whose cost of capital may be lower than ours. Competition for future product, device or asset acquisition opportunities in our markets is competitive and we may be forced to increase the price we pay for such assets or face reduced potential acquisition opportunities. In addition, ten out of seventeen of our acquisitions to date have been or are dependent on, or secured by, single product revenue streams, which increases the risk of payments based on the competitive factors in the market as well as the pricing of the product. The success of our income generating asset acquisitions is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation, timing and amount of payments, which is highly complex and uncertain, and the success of our equity investments and product and device acquisitions are based on our ability to accurately measure the anticipated commercial success, including regulatory approval and pricing, of our products or devices and our counterparties products or devices, which is difficult and subject to various competitive and market factors that may be outside of our control. For example, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their commercial products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. We are unable to control the pricing strategies used by our counterparties, and if our counterparties fail to use appropriate pricing strategies, or receive negative reactions to their pricing strategies, it could negatively impact products from which our revenues would be derived. The failure of any of our acquisitions to produce anticipated revenues may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. Some of our income generating acquisitions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by the counterparty, and we expect the credit-based mix of assets in our portfolio to increase in the future. To mitigate this risk, on occasion, we may obtain a security interest as collateral in the assets of such counterparty. Our credit risk in respect of such counterparty may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount we are due pursuant to the terms of the particular income generating assets or products. This could occur in circumstances where the original collateral was not sufficient to cover a complete loss (e.g., our interests were only partially secured) or may result from the deterioration in value of the collateral, so that, in either such case, we are unable to recover our full capital outlay and any anticipated return. Additionally, we may face difficulty in collection efforts with respect to a credit agreement counterparty that is in default under a credit agreement with us. Such difficulties could lead to litigation or other legal procedures which may or may not be successful, and which will require significant financial and management resources to address. For example, we have been engaged in multiple legal proceedings with Wellstat Diagnostics and its affiliates related to their credit agreement default, which is described in more detail in Note 23, \"Legal Proceedings\" of this Annual Report. Any such losses resulting therefrom could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. We are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers, which could result in material losses.. We believe customer financing through leasing is a consideration for some of our Medical Devices segment customers and have experienced an increase in demand for customer financing. We may experience loss from a customer's failure to make payments according to the contractual lease terms. Our exposure to the credit risks relating to our lease financing arrangements may increase if our customers are adversely affected by changes in healthcare laws, coverage and reimbursement, economic pressures or uncertainty, or other customer-specific factors.. Although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk, there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing credit risks relating to these lease financing arrangements. If the level of credit losses we experience in the future exceed our expectations, such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.. We and our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties may be unable to maintain regulatory approvals for currently licensed products, or to obtain regulatory approvals or favorable pricing for new products, and we or they may voluntarily remove currently licensed products from marketing and commercial distribution. Any of such events, whether due to safety issues or other factors, could reduce our revenues.. We and our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties are subject to stringent regulation with respect to product safety and efficacy by various international, federal, state and local authorities. Of particular significance are the FDA requirements covering research and development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling and promotion of drugs for. 27. human use in the United States. As a result of these requirements, the length of time, the level of expenditures and the laboratory and clinical information required for approval of a biologic license application or new drug application are substantial and can require a number of years. In addition, even if our products, or our licensees', borrowers' and royalty-agreement counterparties' products receive regulatory approval, we and they will remain subject to ongoing FDA and other international regulations including, but not limited to, obligations to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing, changes to the product label, new or revised regulatory requirements for manufacturing practices, written advisements to physicians and/or a product recall or withdrawal. We and our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties may not maintain necessary regulatory approvals for our or their existing licensed products or we or our licensees may not obtain necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, for any of our products, or the licensed products our licensees are developing or manufacturing. Moreover, the current political environment in the United States is focused on potential reductions in pricing for pharmaceutical and other health care products, which may negatively impact any existing or new products from which our revenues would be derived. We are unable to control the pricing strategies used by our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties, and if they fail to use appropriate pricing strategies, or receive negative reactions to their pricing strategies, it could negatively impact our revenues. In addition, communications from government officials regarding pricing for pharmaceutical and other health care products could have a negative impact on our stock price, even if such communications do not ultimately impact our products or our licensees', borrowers' and royalty-agreement counterparties' products. The occurrence of adverse events reported by any licensee, borrower or royalty-agreement counterparty may result in the revocation of regulatory approvals or decreased sales of the applicable product due to a change in physicians' willingness to prescribe, or patients' willingness to use the applicable product. We and our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties could also choose to voluntarily remove licensed products from marketing and commercial distribution. In any of these cases, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. For example, in November 2011, the FDA removed the indication for breast cancer from Avastin's label. In 2005, Tysabri, was temporarily suspended and then returned to the market. In such cases, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected.. In addition, the current regulatory framework could change, or additional regulations could arise at any stage during our licensees' product development or marketing which may affect our licensees' ability to obtain or maintain approval of their licensed products. Delays in our licensees receiving regulatory approval for licensed products or their failure to maintain existing regulatory approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business.. Many of our potential pharmaceutical products, medical devices and income generating assets are in companies or assets that have limited commercialized revenue-generating products or are dependent on the actions of unrelated third parties, which may negatively impact our investment returns.. In anticipation of the expiration of our Queen et al. patents and related license agreements, we recently began acquiring, and plan to continue acquiring, pharmaceutical products and medical devices. Our investment objective with respect to these transactions is to maximize our portfolio's total return by generating current income from product sales or sales of medical devices. We consummated our first investment in our Pharmaceutical segment with Noden in July 2016 and our first acquisition in our Medical Device segment with LENSAR in May 2017. In addition, we have made and will likely continue to make investments in pharmaceutical products, medical devices and/or income generating assets, such as equity investments in product or device focused companies, loans in exchange for a profit share or royalty streams, in the healthcare industries, which investments may be in companies that, at the time of investment, have limited or no commercialized revenue-generating products or devices. If the assets are not successfully commercialized, the value of our investments would be negatively affected and our investment returns would be negatively impacted. The ultimate success of our investments in many of our potential pharmaceutical products, devices and/or income generating assets in these industries will depend on our ability, and the ability of our counterparties or their licensees to innovate, develop and commercialize such assets, in competitive and highly regulated markets. Our or their inability to do so would negatively affect our investment returns. In addition, in connection with many of our potential pharmaceutical products, medical devices and/or income generating assets, we are dependent, to a large extent, on third parties to enforce certain rights for our benefit. For example, we acquired certain royalty rights from Depomed, which, as the licensor of certain patents, retains various rights, including the contractual right to audit its licensees and to ensure those licensees are complying with the terms of the underlying license agreements. Depomed also retains full responsibility to protect and maintain the intellectual property rights underlying the licenses. While we have contractual rights to require Depomed to take action regarding many of these rights, because Depomed's economic interest in the license agreements is limited, it may not enforce or protect those rights as it otherwise would have had it retained the full economic interest in the payments under the license agreements. Moreover, in respect of the royalty stream relating to the Glumetza diabetes medication that we acquired from Depomed, which is the royalty right producing the highest revenues from our Depomed acquired royalties, a single generic manufacturer was approved to enter the market in February 2016 and two additional generic manufacturers were approved to enter the market in August 2016 as provided for in settlement agreements between Depomed and these generic manufacturers. We were aware of these settlement. 28. agreements, considered them in the cost of the acquiring this asset and expect the entry of these generic products to reduce our Glumetza revenues.. We and our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties face significant market pressures with respect to our and their products, and the amount of revenues from our investment in Noden, LENSAR or royalties from our pharmaceutical products or medical devices, or income generating assets that we receive are subject to various competitive and market factors that may be outside of our control.. We and our companies, licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties face competition from other pharmaceutical, biotechnology, device and diagnostic companies. The introduction of new competitive products may result in lost market share for us or our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties, reduced use of our or their products, lower prices and/or reduced product sales, any of which could reduce our royalty revenues, or the revenues on which we rely to produce the returns on our acquisitions, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.. The amount of any royalties and returns on our investments that we receive from our pharmaceutical products, medical device and/or income generating assets will depend on many factors, including the following:. • the timing and availability of generic product or devices competition for our products or devices, and our licensees', borrowers' and royalty-agreement counterparties' products or devices;. • potential challenges or design arounds to product, use or manufacturing related patents which provide exclusivity for products and assets before their expiration by generic pharmaceutical manufacturers;. • the size of the market for our products or devices, and our licensees', borrowers' and royalty-agreement counterparties' products or devices;. • the extent and effectiveness of the sales and marketing and distribution support our licensees', borrowers' and royalty-agreement counterparties' products or devices and the implementation of a new sales force and commercial infrastructure with commercial experience in connection with the commercialization of our products or devices;. • the existence of novel or superior products or devices to our products or devices, or our licensees', borrowers' and royalty-agreement counterparties' products or devices;. • the availability of reduced pricing and discounts applicable to our licensees', borrowers' and royalty-agreement counterparties' products or devices;. • stocking and inventory management practices related to our products or our licensees', borrowers' and royalty-agreement counterparties' products or devices;. • limitations on indications for which our products or devices or our licensees', borrowers' and royalty-agreement counterparties' products or devices can be marketed; the competitive landscape for approved products or devices and developing therapies that compete with our products or devices or our licensees', borrowers' and royalty-agreement counterparties' products or devices;. • the ability of patients to be able to afford our products or devices, or our licensees', borrowers' and royalty-agreement counterparties' products or devices or obtain health care coverage that covers those products or devices;. • acceptance of, and ongoing satisfaction with, our products or devices and our licensees', borrowers' and royalty-agreement counterparties' products or devices by the care providers, patients receiving therapy and third party payors; or. • the unfavorable outcome of any potential litigation relating to our products or devices and our licensees', borrowers' and royalty-agreement counterparties' products or devices.. For example, in 2015, Valeant announced two price increases on Glumetza, a royalty-bearing product under our Depomed Royalty Agreement. While the price increases would have been expected to increase revenues and thus our royalties, the entry of one generic manufacturer into this market in February of 2016 and one additional generic manufacturer in August 2017 has resulted in a significant reduction in pricing and market share for Glumetza. Due to the uncertainties caused by changes in pricing by third parties that are outside our control and generic competition, we may not be able to accurately estimate the impact on royalties on such sales paid to us for Glumetza or any other product. Additionally, Noden's '111 Patent, expires in January of 2019 extended by virtue of pediatric testing requirements. While Noden has additional patent coverage related to drug formulation and manufacturing technology which relate to our commercialization of Tekturna in the United States and which expires later than 2019, competitors may be able to design around these patents and one potential competitor is making such a challenge. We may face generic competition with respect to Tekturna in the United States earlier than the expiration of these latter patents.. 29. We and our licensees must protect our and their intellectual property rights for us to succeed.. Our success is dependent in significant part on our ability and the ability of third parties in control of the assets in which we've invested to protect the scope, validity and enforceability of our and their intellectual property, including the patents, SPCs and license agreements, all of which support our revenues. The scope, validity, enforceability and effective term of patents and SPCs can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings. In addition, the legal principles applicable to patents in any given jurisdiction may be altered through changing court precedent and legislative action, and such changes may affect the scope, strength and enforceability of our patent rights or the nature of proceedings which may be brought related to the relevant patent rights. A finding in a proceeding related to patent rights which support our revenues which narrows the scope or which affects the validity or enforceability of some or all of our patent rights could have a material impact on our ability to continue to collect royalty payments from our investments or collect revenue from our sales of our pharmaceutical products, medical devices and income generating assets.. Our reliance on sole and single source suppliers could harm our ability to meet demand for our products or devices in a timely manner or within budget.. Some of the components necessary for the assembly of our Medical Devices segment devices are currently provided to us by sole-sourced suppliers or single-sourced suppliers. We generally purchase components through purchase orders rather than long-term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of inventory. While alternative suppliers exist and could be identified for sole-sourced components, the disruption or termination of the supply of components could cause a significant increase in the costs of these components, which could affect our operating results. A disruption or termination in the supply of components could also result in our inability to meet demand for our products, which could harm our ability to generate revenues, lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage our reputation. Furthermore, if we are required to change the manufacturer of a key component of our products, we may be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could delay our ability to manufacture our products in a timely manner or within budget, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.. Recently enacted and future legislation is expected to increase the difficulty and costs to maintain revenues from our products, and in particular may negatively impact the pricing of our products.. In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, affect our ability to profitably sell our products.. For example, in the United States in March 2010, the ACA was enacted to increase access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care and the health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The law has continued the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and increased the industry's regulatory burdens and operating costs. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance are the following:. • an annual, non-tax deductible fee payable by any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs payable to the federal government based on each company's market share of prior year total sales of branded products to certain federal healthcare programs;. • imposed an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, with limited exceptions (described in more detail below), although the effective rate paid may be lower. Through a series of legislative amendments, the tax was suspended for 2016 through 2019. Absent further legislative action, the device excise tax will be reinstated on medical device sales starting January 1, 2020; implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models;. • an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;. • a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;. • extension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;. • expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs in certain states;. • a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries under their coverage gap period, as a. 30. condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Subsequent legislative amendments have increased the point-of-sale discounted to 70%, effective 2019;. • expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;. • a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and. • a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.. The potential financial impact of the ACA over the next few years will depend on a number of factors including policies reflected in implementing regulations and guidance and changes in sales volumes for products affected by the new system of rebates, discounts and fees. The taxes imposed by the ACA and the expansion in the government's role in the U.S. healthcare industry may result in decreased profits to us, lower reimbursement by payors for our products, and/or reduced medical procedure volumes, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Trump Administration and the U.S. Congress may take further action regarding the ACA, including, but not limited to, repeal or replacement. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. Additionally, all or a portion of the ACA and related subsequent legislation may be modified, repealed or otherwise invalidated through judicial challenge.. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional action is taken by Congress. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period in which the government may recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their commercial products. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may limit us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercializing our products, which could have a material adverse effect on business and results of operations.. In any event, we expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for pharmaceutical products, which could result in reduced demand for our products or our counterparties' products or additional pricing pressures on our products or our counterparties' products.. Changes in the third-party coverage and reimbursement may affect product sales from which we receive royalty revenues. And the growth of managed care organizations (\"MCOs\") is expected to increase pricing pressures on our products in the United States.. Sales of our products, the products from which we receive royalties and the products our borrowers sell to generate revenues will depend significantly on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments will be available to physicians and patients from various levels of United States and international government health authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payers and government health administration authorities increasingly attempt to limit and/or regulate the coverage and reimbursement of medical products and services, including branded prescription drugs. Changes in government legislation or regulation, such as the ACA, and changes in formulary or compendia listing or changes in private third-party payers' policies toward reimbursement for such products may reduce reimbursement of the cost of such products to physicians, pharmacies and distributors. Decreases in third-party reimbursement could reduce usage of such products and sales to collaborators, which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues derived from our products, those from which we receive royalties from the business of our borrowers. In addition, macroeconomic factors may affect the ability of patients to pay or co-pay for costs or otherwise pay for our products or the products from which we, our royalty counterparties and borrowers generate revenues by, for example, decreasing the number of patients covered by insurance policies or increasing costs associated with such policies.. In the United States in particular, the influence of MCOs has increased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through MCOs. The growth of MCOs has increased pressure on drug prices as well as revenues for pharmaceutical companies. One objective of MCOs is to contain and, where possible, reduce healthcare expenditures. MCOs typically use formularies as a means to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers; physician protocols requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine; volume purchasing; and long-term contracts. In addition, by placing branded medicines on higher-tier status in their formularies or non-preferred tier status, MCOs transfer a portion of the cost of those medicines to the patient (through and increase in co-payment requirements), resulting in significant out-of-pocket expenses. 31. for the patient. This financial disincentive is a means by which MCOs manage drug costs and influence patients to use medicines preferred by the MCOs.. Exclusion of a product from a formulary or other MCO-implemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the MCO patient population. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products. Unique product features, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use, or fewer side effects, are generally beneficial to achieving access to formularies. Larger pharmaceutical companies have the ability to bundle available products and discounts in an effort to place and maintain products on formulary. We will be responsible for meeting the requirements of MCO's in the United States and ensuring the competitive use of our products in a highly uncertain and changing environment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or increase the use of our products, and their inability to succeed could have a material adverse impact on the value of our investments.. Generic products may increase pricing pressures on our products.. Although we believe that our products benefit from both issued and/or pending patents as well as proprietary manufacturing technology, one competitive challenge that our branded pharmaceuticals products face is or will be from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers. Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product, especially a small molecule product, the major portion of revenues for that product may be dramatically reduced in a very short period of time. Several such competitors make a regular practice of challenging product patents before their expiration. Also, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products may file or have already filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (\"ANDA\") with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of our products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned by Noden. We are aware of two such ANDAs that have been filed with the FDA with respect to Tekturna, but neither has been approved. Patent litigation and other challenges to Noden's patents would be costly and unpredictable, would require extensive management time and resources, and may ultimately deprive us of market exclusivity for our products in a given geographical territory. The FDA ANDA approval process exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator's product. Generic competitors do not generally need to conduct clinical trials and can market a competing version of a product after the expiration or loss of patent or regulatory exclusivity and often charge significantly lower prices. In addition, as noted above, MCOs that focus primarily on the immediate cost of medicines often favor generics over branded drugs. Many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs. Additionally, certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies or in other circumstances, which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions, negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows, lead to an impairment charge of our long-lived assets. or result in a material decline of our revenue.. Our products may develop undesirable side effects or have other properties impacting safety or efficacy.. Undesirable side effects caused by our products or similar products sold or developed by other companies, could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects or adverse events, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:. • regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;. • regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;. • we may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;. • we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and. • our reputation may suffer.. Any of these events could significantly harm our business and the value of our investments.. We may have significant product liability exposure and our insurance may not cover all potential claims.. We are exposed to product liability and other claims in the event that our technologies or products are alleged to have caused harm. We may not be able to obtain insurance for the potential liability on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or at reasonable costs. Any potential product liability claims could exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage under the terms of our policies. Our insurance may not be renewed at a cost and level of coverage comparable to that then in effect. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial position and results of operations.. 32. Our third party contractors as well as our own employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could result in significant liability for us and harm our reputation.. We are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct in connection with international business operations and our reliance on third party contractors to manage and conduct those activities with respect to our products. These risks include potential failures to:. • comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities;. • provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities;. • comply with manufacturing standards applicable to our products;. • comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities;. • comply with the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act, and other anti-bribery laws;. • report financial information or data and our business affairs accurately;. • or disclose unauthorized activities to us.. Our investment in Noden, an Irish entity, subjects us to both United States and international tax laws with respect to the structure and operations of our business and the business conducted by Noden, which are subject to continued scrutiny and change by governments and may result in additional liabilities that may affect our results of operations.. Noden is incorporated in Ireland and maintains the performance of certain functions and ownership of certain assets in a more tax-efficient jurisdiction than the United States. Taxing authorities, such as the United States Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"), actively audit and otherwise challenge these types of arrangements, and have regularly done so in the pharmaceutical industry. We remain subject to reviews and audits by the IRS and other taxing authorities from time to time, and the IRS or other taxing authority may challenge our structure and intra-company arrangements through an audit or lawsuit. Responding to or defending against those and other challenges from taxing authorities could be expensive and in any event would consume time and other resources, and divert management's time and focus from business operations. We generally cannot predict whether taxing authorities will conduct an audit or file a lawsuit challenging our current structure, the cost involved in responding to any inquiry or audit or lawsuit, or the outcome. If we are unsuccessful, we may be required to consolidate income and pay greater taxes as well as interest, fines or penalties, and may be obligated to pay increased taxes in the future, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could negatively affect our ability to be competitive in the acquisition of future, additional products.. The regulatory clearance and approval processes of the FDA are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for any new product candidates or modifications to existing products, our business will be substantially harmed.. The time required to obtain approval or clearance of a drug or device, respectively, by the FDA is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials, if required, and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval or clearance policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain marketing authorization may change during the course of a product candidate's development and may vary among jurisdictions. We are not permitted to market any new product candidates in the United States until we receive regulatory approval of an NDA for any new drug product candidate or clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification (or approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA) for any new medical device from the FDA, unless the device is exempt from such requirements.. Prior to obtaining approval to commercialize a drug product candidate in the United States or abroad, we or our collaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. Results from preclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the preclinical or clinical data for our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. The FDA may also require us to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates either prior to or post-approval, or it may object to elements of our clinical development program.. In the United States, before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, new claim for or significant modification to an existing product, we must first receive either clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or. 33. FFDCA, or approval of a premarket approval, or PMA, application from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. In the 510(k) clearance process, before a device may be marketed, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is \"substantially equivalent\" to a legally-marketed \"predicate\" device, which includes a device that has been previously cleared through the 510(k) process, a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device), a device that was originally on the U.S. market pursuant to an approved premarket approval, or PMA, application and later down-classified, or a 510(k)-exempt device. To be \"substantially equivalent,\" the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data are sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. In the PMA process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is safe and effective for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices.. Modifications to products that are approved through a PMA application generally require FDA approval. Similarly, certain modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) may require a new 510(k) clearance. Both the PMA approval and the 510(k) clearance process can be expensive, lengthy and uncertain. The FDA's 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months, but can last longer. The process of obtaining a PMA is much more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process and generally takes from one to three years, or even longer, from the time the application is filed with the FDA. In addition, a PMA generally requires the performance of one or more clinical trials. Despite the time, effort and cost, we cannot assure you that any particular device will be approved or cleared by the FDA. Any delay or failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals could harm our business.. In the United States, we have obtained 510(k) premarket clearance from the FDA to market the LENSAR device. An element of our strategy is to continue to add new features and seek new indications. We expect that any such modifications may require new 510(k) clearance; however, future modifications may be subject to the substantially more costly, time-consuming and uncertain PMA process. If the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous examination for future products or modifications to existing products than we had expected, product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled, which could cause our sales to decline.. The FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of our product candidates or require us to conduct additional preclinical or clinical testing or abandon a program for many reasons, including:. • the FDA's disagreement with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;. • negative or ambiguous results from our clinical trials;. • results that may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA for approval or clearance;. • serious and unexpected drug-related adverse events experienced by participants in our clinical trials or by individuals using drugs similar to our product candidates;. • our inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that our product candidates are safe and effective for the proposed indication or, in the case of our medical devices, are substantially equivalent to our proposed predicate device;. • the FDA's disagreement with the interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;. • our inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of our product candidates outweigh any safety or other perceived risks;. • the FDA's requirement for additional preclinical studies or clinical trials;. • the FDA's disagreement regarding the formulation, labeling or the specifications of our product candidates;. • the FDA's agency's failure to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract; or. • the potential for approval policies or regulations of the FDA to significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.. Of the large number of products in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA marketing authorization process and become commercialized. The lengthy process as well as the unpredictability of outcomes from future clinical trials may result in our failing to obtain regulatory authorization to market our product candidates.. Even if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval of an NDA, 510(k), or similar foreign marketing application for our product candidates, the FDA may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional clinical trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, or in the case of our drugs, the implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or. 34. REMS, which may be required to ensure safe use of the drug after approval. The FDA also may authorize a product candidate for a more limited indication or patient population than we originally requested, and the FDA may not authorize us to market the product with the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of a product candidate. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory authorization would delay or prevent commercialization of that product candidate.. The safety and efficacy of our medical device products is not yet supported by long-term clinical data, which could limit sales, and our products might therefore prove to be less safe or effective than initially thought.. Our medical device products have received premarket clearance under Section 510(k) of the FFDCA. In the 510(k) clearance process, before a device may be marketed the FDA must determine that a proposed device is \"substantially equivalent\" to a legally-marketed \"predicate\" device, which includes a device that has been previously cleared through the 510(k) process, a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device), a device that was originally on the U.S. market pursuant to an approved premarket approval, or PMA, application and later down-classified, or a 510(k)-exempt device. This process is typically shorter and generally requires the submission of less supporting documentation than the FDA's premarket approval, or PMA, process and does not always require long-term clinical studies.. In the European Economic Area, or EEA, manufacturers of medical devices are required by the Medical Devices Directive to collect post-marketing clinical data in relation to their CE marked medical devices. Post-market surveillance includes the conduct of post-market clinical follow-up studies permitting manufacturers to gather information concerning quality, safety or performance of medical devices after they have been placed on the market in the EU. All information collected as part of the post-market surveillance process must be reviewed, investigated and analyzed on a regular basis in order to determine whether trending conclusions can be made concerning the safety or performance of the medical device and decisions must be taken in relation to the continued marketing of medical devices currently on the market. We expect to incur ongoing costs to comply with these post-market clinical obligations in EEA markets for so long as we continue to market and sell products in those markets. We anticipate that these costs will be immaterial going forward.. Given the foregoing regulatory environment in which we operate, we lack the breadth of published long-term clinical data supporting the safety and efficacy of our medical devices and the benefits they offer that might have been generated in connection with other approval processes. For these reasons, the market may be slow to adopt our products, we may not have comparative data that our competitors have or are generating, and we may be subject to greater regulatory and product liability risks.. In addition, while our LENSAR® Laser systems were first approved in 2010 in the United States and in 2013 in EU, we have limited complication or patient success rate data with respect to uses of our products. In addition, if future studies and experience indicate that the our products cause unexpected or serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects, we could be subject to mandatory product recalls or suspension or withdrawal of FDA clearance, and our reputation with physicians, patients and healthcare providers may suffer.. The misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our reputation in the marketplace, result in injuries that lead to product liability suits or result in costly investigations, fines or sanctions by regulatory bodies if we are deemed to have engaged in the promotion of these uses, any of which could be costly to our business.. Our products have been approved or cleared by the FDA for specific indications. We train our marketing and direct sales force to not promote our products for uses outside of these cleared or approved indications for use, known as \"off-label uses.\" We cannot, however, prevent a physician from using or prescribing our products off-label, when in the physician's independent professional medical judgment he or she deems it appropriate. There may be increased risk of injury to patients if physicians prescribe or use our products off-label. Furthermore, the use of our products for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA or  any foreign regulatory body may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients.. If the FDA or any foreign regulatory body determines that our promotional materials or training constitute promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance or imposition of an untitled letter, which is used for violators that do not necessitate a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action under other regulatory authority, such as false claims laws, if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment of our operations.. 35. Moreover, if our products are misused or used with improper technique, we may become subject to costly litigation. Product liability claims could divert management's attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and result in sizeable damage awards against us that may not be covered by insurance. In addition, any of the events described above could harm our business.. Even though we have received regulatory approval for our drug product candidates and clearance of a premarket notification for our devices, we are subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which results in significant additional expense, and we may be subject to penalties, if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates.. Any regulatory approvals or clearances that we receive may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The FDA may also require a REMS as a condition of approval of our product candidates, which could include requirements for a medication guide, physician communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools.. In addition, once the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority authorizes a product for marketing, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export and recordkeeping are subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMPs and GCP requirements for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. For example, we are subject to the medical device reporting requirements for our medical device products, which require us to report to the FDA when we receive or become aware of information that reasonably suggests that one or more of our medical devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that, if the malfunction were to recur, it could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. The timing of our obligation to report is triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events of which we become aware within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to recognize that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of the product. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA could take enforcement action against us. We are subject to similar post-market reporting requirements with respect to our drug products.. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our product candidates, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:. • restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of our product candidates, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;. • fines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials;. • refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or suspension or revocation of approvals;. • product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of our product candidates; and. • injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.. The FDA's and other regulatory authorities' policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could impact our business. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and medical devices and spur innovation, but its ultimate implementation remains unclear. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may fail to obtain any marketing approvals, lose any marketing approval that we have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.. We also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. For example, certain policies of the Trump administration may impact our business and industry. Namely, the Trump administration has taken several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA's ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. If these executive actions impose constraints on FDA's ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted.. 36. Our acquisition of pharmaceutical products, including the Noden Products, and acquisitions of medical devices, including the LENSAR laser system, will make us subject to more extensive healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement and our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.. The acquisition of pharmaceutical products and medical devices, and our sales and marketing efforts with respect to our products and/or medical devices, will increase our potential risk of civil and criminal enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments. Our business practices and relationships with providers are subject to scrutiny under these laws. We may also be subject to privacy and security regulation related to patient, customer, employee and other third-party information by both the federal government and the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The laws, regulations and codes that may affect us in the United States include:. • the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. The U.S. government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties up to $74,792 for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act. Violations can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $100,000 and imprisonment of up to 10 years. Similarly, violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;. • federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third party payors that are false or fraudulent. Private individuals can bring False Claims Act ''qui tam'' actions, on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as ''whistleblowers,'' may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil fines and penalties ranging from $11,181 to $22,363 for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs;. • the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary's decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;. • The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\"), which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;. • HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (\"HITECH\"), and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, without appropriate authorization, including mandatory contractual terms as well as directly applicable privacy and security standards and requirements. Failure to comply with the HIPAA privacy and security standards can result in civil monetary penalties up to $55,910 per violation, not to exceed $1.68 million per calendar year for non-compliance of an identical provision, and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties with fines up to $250,000 per violation and/or imprisonment. State attorneys general can also bring a civil action to enjoin a HIPAA violation or to obtain statutory damages on behalf of residents of his or her state;. 37. • the federal physician sunshine requirements under the ACA, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"), information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members. Applicable manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to CMS. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of $11,052 per failure up to an aggregate of $165,786 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.105 million per year for ''knowing failures''), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations;. • guidelines promulgated by the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services related to pharmaceutical company regulatory compliance programs and the PhRMA Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals, as amended;. • foreign and state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as the FCPA, anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payor, including commercial insurers;. • state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources;. • state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and. • state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.. These laws and regulations, among other things, constrain our business, marketing and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers of our products. Due to the breadth of these laws, the narrowness of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, and the range of interpretations to which they are subject, it is possible that some of our current or future practices might be challenged under one or more of these laws.. To enforce compliance with the healthcare regulatory laws, certain enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Responding to investigations can be time-and resource-consuming and can divert management's attention from the business. Additionally, as a result of these investigations, healthcare providers and entities may have to agree to additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity, and be costly to respond to.. We do not have experience in establishing the compliance programs necessary to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment and our reliance on Noden and LENSAR to operate and address these requirements appropriately increases the risks that we may be found to violate the applicable laws and regulations if they are applied to us. If we are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, disgorgement and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could materially adversely affect interests in our products, including having a material adverse effect on our financial results.. Our common stock may lose value, our common stock could be delisted from Nasdaq and our business may be liquidated due to several factors, including the expiration of our Queen et al. patents, the failure to acquire additional sources of revenue, decrease in revenues from of our income generating assets, the failure to continue to produce revenues for our existing assets in our Pharmaceutical or Medical Device segments, the payment of dividends or distributions to our stockholders and failure to meet analyst expectations.. Our revenues to date have consisted mostly of royalties from licensees of our Queen et al. patents, which patents expired in December of 2014 and most related licenses expired in the first quarter of 2016.. Prospectively, we expect to focus on the acquisition of additional products and devices and anticipate that over time more of our revenues will come from our Pharmaceutical and Medical Device segments and less of our revenues will come from our Income Generating Assets segment. If we are unable to successfully execute all or any elements of our strategy, our financial performance. 38. could be adversely affected, and the price of our common stock may fall. If the price of our common stock were to fall and remain below Nasdaq listing standards, our common stock may be delisted. If our common stock were delisted, market liquidity for our common stock could be severely affected and our stockholders' ability to sell securities in the secondary market could be limited. Delisting from Nasdaq would negatively affect the value of our common stock. Delisting could also have other negative results, including, but not limited to, the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.. The lack of liquidity for the assets in our acquisitions may adversely affect our business and, if we need to sell any of our acquired assets, we may not be able to do so at a favorable price. As a result, we may suffer losses.. We generally acquire patents, royalty rights and debt instruments that have limited secondary resale markets. The illiquidity of most of our assets may make it difficult for us to dispose of them at a favorable price and, as a result, we may suffer losses if we are required to dispose of any or all such assets in a liquidation or otherwise. In addition, if we liquidate all or a portion of our assets quickly or in connection with a liquidation, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded these assets.. We may use a certain amount of cash from time to time in order to satisfy the obligations relating to our convertible notes. The maturity or conversion of any of our convertible notes may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.. On February 1, 2018, we repaid our 4.0% Convertible Senior Notes due February 1, 2018 (the \"February 2018 Notes\") in full at their stated maturity. In addition, we are required to repay the full principal amount of $150.0 million in principal amount outstanding under the 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due December 1, 2021 (the \"December 2021 Notes\") if not previously converted.. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, to pay any cash due upon conversion of, or to refinance, our indebtedness, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.. Holders of the December 2021 Notes may convert their notes at their option under the following conditions at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding June 1, 2021: (i) during any fiscal quarter (and only during such fiscal quarter) commencing after the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2017, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), in the period of 30 consecutive trading days, ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, exceeds 130% of the conversion price for the notes on each applicable trading day; (ii) during the five business day period immediately after any five consecutive trading-day period (the measurement period), in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the December 2021 Notes for each trading day of that measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the notes for each such trading day; or (iii) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.. The December 2021 Notes may be settled by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, although it is the current intention that they will be net-share settled. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes when conversion is permitted, we would be required to make cash payments to satisfy up to the face value of our conversion obligation in respect of each note, which could adversely affect our liquidity.. We may use a certain amount of cash from time to time in order to satisfy repurchase or other obligations relating to our convertible notes which could adversely affect the amount or timing of any distribution to our stockholders or any income generating transactions. In addition, we may redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire the convertible notes in the open market in the future, any of which could adversely affect the amount or timing of any cash distribution to our stockholders.. 39. The conversion or any future exchanges of any of the December 2021 Notes into shares of our common stock would have a dilutive effect that could cause our stock price to go down.. Until June 1, 2021, the December 2021 Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock only if specified conditions are met and thereafter convertible at any time, at the option of the holder. We have reserved shares of our authorized common stock for issuance upon conversion of these convertible notes. Upon conversion, the principal amount is due in cash, and to the extent that the conversion value exceeds the principal amount, the difference is due in shares of common stock. If any or all of these convertible notes are converted into shares of our common stock, our existing stockholders will experience immediate dilution of voting rights and our common stock price may decline. Furthermore, the perception that such dilution could occur may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.. We entered into a capped call transaction in connection with the issuance of our December 2021 Notes that may affect the value of our common stock and any desired dilution mitigation will be limited to the extent that our stock price rises above the cap price of the capped call transaction.. In connection with the issuance of our December 2021 Notes, we entered into a capped call transaction, with a hedge counterparty, which we expect to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the December 2021 Notes in the event that the market price per share of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transaction, at the time of exercise is greater than the strike price of the capped call transaction, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the notes and is subject to certain adjustments similar to those contained in the December 2021 Notes. If, however, the market price per share of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transaction, exceeds the cap price ($4.88 per share) of the capped call transaction, there would nevertheless be dilution to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the capped call transaction.. In connection with hedging the capped call transaction, the hedge counterparty or its affiliates:. • expect to purchase our common stock in the open market and/or enter into various derivatives and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock; and. • may enter into or unwind various derivatives and/or purchase or sell our common stock in secondary market transactions.. These activities could have the effect of increasing or preventing a decline in the price of our common stock concurrently with or following the pricing of the December 2021 Notes and could have the effect of decreasing the price of our common stock during the period immediately prior to a conversion of the December 2021 Notes.. The hedge counterparty or its affiliates are likely to modify their hedge positions in relation to the capped call transaction from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the December 2021 Notes by purchasing and selling our common stock, other of our securities, or other instruments they may wish to use in connection with such hedging.. In addition, we intend to exercise options we hold under the capped call transaction whenever the December 2021 Notes are converted. In order to unwind its hedge positions with respect to those exercised options, the counterparty or affiliates thereof expect to sell our common stock in secondary market transactions or unwind various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock during the period immediately prior to conversion of the December 2021 Notes. We have also agreed to indemnify the hedge counterparty and affiliates thereof for losses incurred in connection with a potential unwinding of their hedge positions under certain circumstances.. The effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock. For further information regarding the mechanics of our capped call transaction refer to our discussion in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 14, \"Convertible Notes and Term Loans\" in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report.. Despite our current debt levels, we may still incur additional debt; if we incur substantial additional debt, these higher levels of debt may affect our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our convertible notes.. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, some of which may be secured debt. The indenture governing the convertible notes do not restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. If we incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, these. 40. higher levels of indebtedness may affect our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our convertible notes, or any fundamental change in purchase price or any cash due upon conversion, and our creditworthiness generally.. We have implemented a corporate structure taking into consideration our limited operations and potentially applicable tax impact on our royalty and other income, and any changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or enforcement positions of tax authorities may negatively impact our financial condition and operating results.. We have established our corporate structure to be closely aligned with the financial nature of our business. There can be no assurance that the applicable tax laws and regulations will continue in effect or that the taxing authorities in any or all of the applicable jurisdictions will not challenge one or more aspects or characterizations of our corporate structure and the treatment of transactions or agreements within our corporate structure, or determine that the manner in which we operate our business is not consistent with our corporate structure. For example, recently-enacted U.S. tax legislation may result in an increased tax liability as a result of our current corporate structure. We may also have disputes with one or more state tax authorities regarding whether we are subject to that state's tax and, if we are subject to such state's tax, what proportion of our revenues is subject to taxation in such state. For example, we are currently subject to an audit by the California Franchise Tax Board and, while we may disagree with their conclusions regarding such issues, the proceedings extend over long periods of time and we may ultimately be required to pay taxes either in a settlement or upon a final decision of an agency or court. Any unfavorable changes in laws and regulations or positions by tax authorities could harm our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.. We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.. We are subject to taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions. Tax rates in these jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic and/or political conditions. A number of other factors may also impact our future effective tax rate including:. • the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;. • the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;. • changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;. • increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired intangibles and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;. • changes in availability of tax credits, tax holidays, and tax deductions;. • changes in share-based compensation; and. • changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles.. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"2017 Tax Act\"). The 2017 Tax Act significantly changed the existing U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, lowering the corporate tax rate, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time deemed repatriation toll tax on cumulative undistributed foreign earnings, for which we have not previously provided U.S. taxes. Given the timing, scope, and magnitude of the changes enacted by the 2017 Tax Act, along with on-going implementation efforts, guidance, and other developments from U.S. regulatory and standard-setting bodies, the completion of the accounting for certain tax items included in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, that have been reported as provisional, or where no estimate of the impact was provided as a result of us not having the necessary information, may be subject to material change. Any significant changes to our future effective tax rate, including final resolution of provisional amounts relating to effects of the 2017 Tax Act, may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.. In addition, certain activities conducted by our foreign subsidiaries may give rise to United States corporate income tax, even if there are no distributions to the United States. These taxes would be imposed on us when our subsidiaries that are controlled foreign corporations generate income that is subject to Subpart F of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (\"Subpart F\"). Passive income, such as rents, royalties, interest and dividends, is among the types of income subject to taxation under Subpart F. Any income taxable under Subpart F is taxable in the United States at federal corporate income tax rates of 21.0%. Subpart F income that is taxable to us, even if it is not distributed to us, may also include income from intercompany transactions between our U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries, or where our non-U.S. subsidiaries make an \"investment in U.S. property,\" within the meaning of Subpart F, such as holding the stock in, or making a loan to, a U.S. corporation.. While we may mitigate this increase in its effective tax rate through claiming a foreign tax credit against our U.S. federal income taxes or potentially have foreign or U.S. taxes reduced under applicable income tax treaties, we are subject to various limitations on claiming foreign tax credits and we may lack treaty protections in certain jurisdictions that will potentially limit any reduction. 41. of the increased effective tax rate. A higher effective tax rate may also result to the extent that losses are incurred in non-U.S. subsidiaries do not reduce our U.S. taxable income.. Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.. At December 31, 2017, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $117.3 million and $299.9 million, respectively, and federal and state tax credit carryforwards of $2.3 million and $19.3 million, respectively. There may be limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax assets. For example, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change\" (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We or our subsidiaries may have experienced, or may in the future experience, \"ownership changes\" as a result of shifts in stock ownership. Tax attributes acquired from LENSAR may be subject to separate return limitations (\"SRLY\") that may limit the corporation's ability to use the acquired net operating losses and credits. Any limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, under the 2017 Tax Act, although the treatment of tax losses generated in taxable years ending before December 31, 2017 has generally not changed, tax losses generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may only be utilized to offset 80% of taxable income annually. This change may require us to pay additional federal income taxes in future years.. We depend on our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties for the determination of royalty payments. While we have rights to audit our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties, the independent auditors may have difficulty determining the correct royalty calculation, we may not be able to detect errors and payment calculations may call for retroactive adjustments. We may have to exercise legal remedies to resolve any disputes resulting from the audit or otherwise related to non-performance by a licensee or royalty counterparty.. The royalty payments we receive are determined by our licensees based on their reported sales. Each licensee's calculation of the royalty payments is subject to and dependent upon the adequacy and accuracy of its sales and accounting functions, and errors may occur from time to time in the calculations made by a licensee. Our license and royalty agreements provide us the right to audit the calculations and sales data for the associated royalty payments; however, our right to conduct such audits may be limited in terms of the covered periods, and such audits may occur many months following our recognition of the royalty revenue, may require us to adjust our royalty revenues in later periods and may require incurring additional expenses on our part. Further, our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties may be uncooperative or have insufficient records, which may complicate and delay the audit process.. Although we regularly exercise our royalty audit rights, and reference publicly available information in the assessment of the paid royalties, we rely in the first instance on our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties to accurately report sales and calculate and pay applicable royalties and, upon exercise of such royalty audit rights, we rely on licensees' and royalty-agreement counterparties' cooperation in performing such audits. In the absence of such cooperation, we may be forced to exercise legal remedies to enforce our agreements.. We may experience increases and decreases in our revenues due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to mitigate this risk.. Our operating results are subject to volatility due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates to revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency rates, particularly the Euro, relative to the U.S. dollar can significantly affect our revenues and operating results. While foreign currency conversion terms vary by license agreement, generally most agreements require that royalties first be calculated in the currency of sale and then converted into U.S. dollars using the average daily exchange rates for that currency for a specified period at the end of the calendar quarter. For example, when the U.S. dollar weakens in relation to other currencies, the converted amount is greater than it would have been had the U.S. dollar exchange rates remained unchanged. Our revenues may fluctuate due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and is subject to foreign currency exchange risk.. To compensate for Euro currency fluctuations, we hedge Euro currency exposures with Euro forward and option contracts, to offset the risks associated with these Euro currency exposures. We may suspend the use of these contracts from time to time or we may be unsuccessful in our attempt to hedge our Euro currency risk. We will continue to experience foreign currency related fluctuations in our royalty revenues in certain instances when we do not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts or where it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our foreign currency related exposures. Currency related fluctuations in our royalty. 42. revenues will vary based on the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to offset these exposures and other factors. All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, the timing of which is variable and generally outside of our control.. We must attract, retain and integrate key employees in order to succeed. It may be difficult to recruit, retain and integrate key employees.. To be successful, we must attract, retain and integrate qualified personnel. Our business is intellectual property asset management and acquisition, investing in pharmaceutical products, devices and/or income generating assets and maximizing the value of our patent portfolio and related assets, which requires only a small number of employees. Due to the remote location of our company's headquarters, it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain qualified personnel. If we are unsuccessful in attracting, retaining and integrating qualified personnel, our business could be impaired.. Our agreements with Facet may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm's-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties.. The agreements associated with the spin-off of Facet Biotech Corporation (\"Facet\") in December 2008 (the \"Spin-Off\"), including the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement and Cross License Agreement, were negotiated in the context of the Spin-Off while Facet was still part of us and, accordingly, may not reflect more favorable terms that may have resulted from arm's-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties.. We may have obligations for which we may not be able to collect under our indemnification rights from Facet.. Under the terms of the Separation and Distribution agreement with Facet, we and Facet agreed to indemnify the other from and after the Spin-Off with respect to certain indebtedness, liabilities and obligations that were retained by our respective companies. These indemnification obligations could be significant. The ability to satisfy these indemnities, if called upon to do so, will depend upon our future financial strength. We cannot assure you that, if Facet has to indemnify us for any substantial obligations, Facet will have the ability to satisfy those obligations. If Facet does not have the ability to satisfy those obligations, we may be required to satisfy those obligations instead. For example, in connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into amendments to the leases for the facilities in Redwood City, California, which formerly served as our corporate headquarters, under which Facet was added as a co-tenant under the leases and a Co-Tenancy Agreement under which Facet agreed to indemnify us for all matters related to the leases attributable to the period after the Spin-Off date. Should Facet default under its lease obligations, we would be held liable by the landlord as a co-tenant and, thus, we have in substance guaranteed the payments under the lease agreements for the Redwood City facilities, the disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on the amount or timing of any distribution to our stockholders. As of December 31, 2017, the total lease payments for the duration of the guarantee, which runs through December 2021, are approximately $45.1 million. We would also be responsible for lease-related payments including utilities, property taxes and common area maintenance that may be as much as the actual lease payments. In April 2010, Abbott Laboratories acquired Facet and renamed the company Abbott Biotherapeutics Corp., and in January 2013, Abbott Biotherapeutics Corp. was renamed AbbVie Biotherapeutics, Inc. and spun off from Abbott as a subsidiary of AbbVie Inc. We do not know how Abbott's acquisition of Facet will impact our ability to collect under our indemnification rights or whether Facet's ability to satisfy its obligations will change. In addition, we have limited information rights under the Co-Tenancy Agreement. As a result, we are unable to determine definitively whether Facet continues to occupy the space and whether it has subleased the space to another party or the basis upon which our potential co-tenant obligation may be triggered. See \"Item 2 - Properties.\". As we continue to develop our business, our mix of assets and sources of income may require that we register with the SEC as an \"investment company\" in accordance with the Investment Company Act of 1940.. We are not registered and have no intention to register as an \"investment company\" under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \"40 Act\").   As a result, we are not and do not expect to become subject to regulation under the 40 Act, including its reporting and corporate governance requirements and restrictions on leverage and affiliate transactions.. Generally, to avoid being regulated as an \"investment company\" under the 40 Act an issuer must:. • not be engaged or hold itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities and not own or propose to acquire \"investment securities\" with a value of more than 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis; or. • be able to rely on an exception from the definition of \"investment company\" under the '40 Act or an exemptive rule.. 43. \"Investment securities\" are any securities other than U.S. government securities and securities issued by a majority-owned subsidiary that is not itself either an \"investment company\" or a private investment company, meaning a company that is excluded from the definition of \"investment company\" by Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the 40 Act.. We have in the past and may in the future rely on one or more exceptions to the definition of \"investment company\" under the 40 Act, including the exception under Section 3(c)(5) of the 40 Act. To rely on Section 3(c)(5), as interpreted by the staff of the SEC, we would be required to have at least 55% of our total assets in certain qualifying assets. In a no-action letter issued to Royalty Pharma on August 13, 2010, the SEC staff stated that certain royalty interests of the type we own can be treated as qualifying assets.. In light of the change in the composition of our assets as a result of the Noden Transaction, we determined that the exception provided by Section 3(c)(5) might no longer be applicable and we therefore have elected for now to rely on the exemption provided by Rule 3a-2 under the 40 Act for so-called \"transient investment companies\". Rule 3a-2 provides a safe harbor for a period of one year so long as the company does not intend to engage primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and has a bona fide intent to be engaged primarily as soon as is reasonably possible, and in any event within that one-year period, in a non-investment company business. A company may rely on Rule 3a-2 only once during any three-year period.. Our board of directors has determined and resolved that we not engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and is implementing a plan to restructure our business and the composition of our assets to make clear that we are not an \"investment company\" within the meaning of the 40 Act. This may limit our ability to make certain investments (including divesting certain assets), or require us to take or forego certain actions, that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation. There can be no assurance that we will be able to execute that plan within the one-year deadline. In addition, if the SEC, its staff or the courts changes their interpretation of certain provisions of the 40 Act, including Section 3(c)(5), we may need to take additional steps in order to avoid becoming subject to regulation under the 40 Act, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.. If we were required to register as an \"investment company,\" the obligations imposed on us by the 40 Act would likely require substantial changes in the way we do business and would result in significant additional regulatory and administrative burdens and costs. In order to remain outside the scope of regulation under the 40 Act, we may need to take various actions which we might otherwise not pursue. These actions may include restructuring our company and modifying our mixture of assets and income, including divesting certain desirable assets immediately, and could have a material and adverse effect on us.. We have in the past and are currently involved in, and expect that in the future we will from time to time be involved in, litigation, either as a defendant or a plaintiff, which could have a negative impact on our operations and results.. Monitoring and defending against or prosecuting legal actions is time-consuming for our management and may detract from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our core business goal of acquiring and managing income generating assets. In addition, legal fees and costs incurred in connection with such activities may be significant. Depending on the nature of the lawsuit, a decision adverse to our interests could result in the payment of substantial damages and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial position or impact our rights in an adverse way.. Failure in our information technology and storage systems could significantly disrupt the operation of our business.. Our ability to execute our business plan depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology (\"IT\") systems. IT systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of our servers may be vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our IT systems, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to generate and maintain data could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.. Changes to financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations. A change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing standards or the reevaluation of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.. 44. We use estimates, make judgments, and apply certain methods in measuring the progress of our business in determining our financial results and in applying our accounting policies. As these estimates, judgments, and methods change, our assessment of the progress of our business and our results of operations could vary.. The methods, estimates, and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. Such methods, estimates, and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and factors may arise over time may lead us to change our methods, estimates, and judgments. Changes in any of our assumptions may adversely affect our reported financial results.. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. We are required, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\"Section 404\"), to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 also generally requires an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.. Our compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. Our acquired businesses may have limited experience complying with Section 404 and if in the future we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets."
