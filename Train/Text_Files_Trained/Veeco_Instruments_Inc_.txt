[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. Key Risk Factors That May Impact Future Results. Stockholders should carefully consider the risk factors described below. Any of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, and stock price.. Unfavorable market conditions may adversely affect our operating results.. Conditions of the markets in which we operate are volatile and have in the past, and may in the future, deteriorate significantly. We have experienced and may continue to experience customer rescheduling and, to a lesser extent, cancellations of orders for our products. Adverse market conditions relative to our products could result in:.                   reduced demand for our products;.                   rescheduling and cancellations of orders for our products, resulting in negative backlog adjustments;.                   increased price competition leading to lower margin for our products;.                   increased competition from sellers of used equipment or lower-priced alternatives to our products;.                   increased inventory obsolescence;.                   an increase in uncollectable amounts due from our customers resulting in increased reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable;.                   disruptions in our supply chain as we reduce our purchasing volumes and limit our contract manufacturing operations; and.                   higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues.. If the markets in which we participate experience deteriorations or downturns, this could negatively impact our sales and revenue generation, margins, operating expenses, and profitability.. 11. Table of Contents. We are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.. Most of our sales are to customers located outside of the United States, and we expect sales from non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our sales in the future. Our non-U.S. sales and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business outside the United States, many of which are outside our control including:.                   political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations, and policies within countries that favor local companies over U.S. companies, including government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;.                   differing legal systems and standards of trade which may not honor our intellectual property rights and which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;.                   pressures from foreign customers and foreign governments for us to increase our operations and sourcing in the foreign country;.                   multiple conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including varying labor laws, tax regulations, import/export controls, changes to trade treaties, possible trade wars, and other trade barriers and uncertainties;.                   reliance on various information systems and information technology to conduct our business, which may be vulnerable to cyberattacks by third parties or breached due to employee error, misuse, or other causes that could result in business disruptions, loss of or damage to intellectual property, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, or other adverse consequences should our security practices and procedures prove ineffective;.                   regional economic downturns, varying foreign government support, and unstable political environments;.                   difficulties in managing a global enterprise, including staffing, managing distributors and representatives, and repatriating cash;.                   longer sales cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; and.                   different customs and ways of doing business.. These challenges, many of which are associated with sales into the Asia-Pacific region, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business.. We may be unable to effectively enforce and protect our intellectual property rights.. Our success depends in part upon the protection of our intellectual property rights. We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary information, technologies, processes, and brand identity. We own various U.S. and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to certain of our products and technologies. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive, and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be circumvented, invalidated, or rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or through efforts by others to reverse engineer our products or design around patents that we own. Policing unauthorized use of our products and technologies is difficult and time consuming and the laws of other countries may not protect our proprietary rights as fully or as readily as U.S. laws. Given these limitations, our success will depend in part upon our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors.. In addition, our outsourcing strategy requires that we share certain portions of our technology with our outsourcing partners, which poses additional risks of infringement and trade secret misappropriation. Infringement of our rights by a third party, possibly for purposes of developing and selling competing products, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities. Similar exposure could result in the event that former employees seek to compete with us through their unauthorized use of our intellectual property and proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the protective steps and measures we have taken will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary information and technologies, nor can we be certain that applicable intellectual property laws, regulations, and policies will not be changed in a manner detrimental to the sale or use of our products.. 12. Table of Contents. Litigation may be required to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, and to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. As a result of any such litigation, we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patents, incur substantial costs, and jeopardize relationships with current or prospective customers or suppliers. Any action we take to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights could absorb significant management time and attention, and could otherwise negatively impact our operating results.. We may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by others.. We receive communications from time to time from other parties asserting the existence of patent or other rights which they believe cover certain of our products. We also periodically receive notice from customers who believe that we are required to indemnify them for damages they may incur related to infringement claims made against these customers by third parties. Our customary practice is to evaluate such assertions and to consider the available alternatives, including whether to seek a license, if appropriate. However, we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or, if obtained, will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur. If we are not able to resolve a claim, negotiate a settlement of the matter, obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or successfully prosecute and defend our position, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.. We may be unable to successfully integrate the Ultratech business and may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.. On May 26, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Ultratech, Inc., merging two companies that formerly operated as independent public companies. Significant management attention and resources have been devoted, and will need to be devoted, to integrating our respective business operations and practices. The success of our acquisition of Ultratech will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and revenue and cost synergies associated with this business combination, which is subject to the following risks, among others:.                   whether the combined businesses will perform as expected;.                   the possibility that we paid more for the acquisition of Ultratech than the value we will derive from the acquisition;.                   complexities associated with managing the combined businesses, including difficulties addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies and the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks, and other assets of each of the companies in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees, and other business partners;.                   the potential loss of customers and strategic partners who may not wish to continue their relationships with the combined company; and.                   potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen or unanticipated costs.. In connection with the accounting for the Ultratech acquisition, we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately $539 million. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of the goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets have been impaired. Finite-lived intangible assets will be assessed for impairment in the event of an impairment indicator. Any reduction or impairment in the value of goodwill and other intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance.. The price of our common shares is volatile and could further decline.. The stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has experienced significant volatility. The trading price of our common shares has declined, and could continue to decline, independent of the overall market, and shareholders could lose all or a substantial part of their investment. The market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors, including among others:.                   difficult macroeconomic conditions, unfavorable geopolitical events, and general stock market uncertainties, such as those occasioned by a global liquidity crisis and a failure of large financial institutions;. 13. Table of Contents.                   the emergence of competitors and competing technologies;.                   receipt of large orders or cancellations of orders for our products;.                   issues associated with the performance and reliability of our products;.                   actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations;.                   announcements of financial developments or technological innovations;.                   our failure to meet the performance estimates of investment research analysts;.                   changes in recommendations and financial estimates by investment research analysts;.                   strategic transactions, such as acquisitions, divestitures, and spin-offs;.                   the commencement of, and rulings on, litigation and legal proceedings;.                   the dilutive impact of our Convertible Senior Notes; and.                   the occurrence of major catastrophic events.. As with many technology companies, the price of our common shares has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to be volatile in the future. Securities class action litigation is often brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. If similar litigation were to be pursued against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.. We face significant competition.. We face significant competition throughout the world, which may increase as certain markets in which we operate continue to evolve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing, and marketing resources than us. Other competitors are located in regions with lower labor costs and other reduced costs of operation. In addition, our ability to compete in foreign countries against local manufacturers may be hampered by nationalism, social attitudes, laws, regulations, and policies within such countries that favor local companies over U.S. companies or that are otherwise designed to promote the development and growth of local competitors. Furthermore, we face competition from smaller emerging equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services we offer, with a focused approach on innovative technology for specialized markets. New product introductions or enhancements by us or our competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our existing or prior generation products. Increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price competition resulting in lower margins.. To remain competitive, we may enter into strategic alliances with customers, suppliers, and other third parties to explore new market opportunities and possible technological advancements. These alliances may require significant investments of capital and other resources and often involve the exchange of sensitive confidential information. The success of these alliances may depend on factors over which we have limited control and will likely require ongoing cooperation and good faith efforts from our strategic partners. Strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks, and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.. We operate in industries characterized by rapid technological change.. Each of the industries in which we operate is subject to rapid technological change. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our ability to enhance existing products and develop and manufacture new products in a timely and cost effective manner and to accurately predict technology transitions. New product development commitments must be made well in advance of sales, and we must anticipate the future demand for products when selecting which development programs to fund and pursue. Our financial results depend on the successful introduction of new products, many of which require the achievement of increasingly stringent technical specifications. We may not be successful in selecting, developing, manufacturing, and marketing new products and new technologies or in enhancing our existing products. Our performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to accurately predict evolving market trends and related customer needs and to effectively allocate our resources among new and existing products and technologies.. 14. Table of Contents. We are also exposed to potential risks associated with unexpected product performance issues. Our product designs and manufacturing processes are complex and could contain unexpected product defects, especially when products are first introduced. Unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs and damages, including increased service and warranty expenses, the need to provide product replacements or modifications, reimbursement for damages caused by our products, product recalls, related litigation, product write-offs, and disposal costs. These costs could be substantial and our reputation could be harmed, resulting in a reduced demand for our products and a negative effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. Our sales to manufacturers are highly dependent on sales of consumer electronics applications, which can experience significant volatility due to seasonal and other factors.. The demand for LEDs, HDDs, semiconductors, and other devices is highly dependent on sales of consumer electronics, such as televisions, computers, tablets, digital video recorders, smartphones, cell phones, and other mobile devices. Manufacturers of LEDs are among our largest customers and account for a substantial portion of our revenue. Factors that could influence the levels of spending on consumer electronic products include consumer confidence, access to credit, volatility in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets, labor and healthcare costs, and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. These and other economic factors have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on the demand for our customers' products and, in turn, on our customers' demand for our products and services. Furthermore, manufacturers of LEDs have in the past overestimated their potential for market share growth. If this growth is overestimated, we may experience cancellations of orders in backlog, rescheduling of customer deliveries, obsolete inventory, and liabilities to our suppliers for products no longer needed.. In addition, the demand for our customers' products can be even more volatile and unpredictable due to the possibility of competing technologies, such as flash memory as an alternative to HDDs. Unpredictable fluctuations in demand for our customers' products or rapid shifts in demand from our customers' products to alternative technologies could materially and adversely impact our future results of operations.. We have a concentrated customer base, located primarily in a limited number of regions, which operate in highly concentrated industries.. Our customer base continues to be highly concentrated. Orders from a relatively limited number of customers have accounted for, and likely will continue to account for, a substantial portion of our net sales, which may lead customers to demand pricing and other terms less favorable to us. Customer consolidation activity involving some of our largest customers could result in an even greater concentration of our sales in the future. Management changes at key customer accounts could result in a loss of future sales due to vendor preferences or other reasons and may introduce new challenges in managing customer relationships.. If a principal customer discontinues its relationship with us or suffers economic setbacks, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to increase sales in the future will depend in part upon our ability to obtain orders from new customers and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts. In addition, because a relatively small number of large manufacturers, many of whom are our customers, dominate the industries in which they operate, it may be especially difficult for us to replace these customers if we lose their business. A significant portion of orders in our backlog are orders from our principal customers.. 15. Table of Contents. In addition, a substantial investment is required by customers to install and integrate capital equipment into a production line. As a result, once a manufacturer has selected a particular vendor to supply capital equipment, the manufacturer will often attempt to consolidate its other capital equipment requirements with the same vendor. Accordingly, if a customer selects a competitor's product over ours, we could experience difficulty selling to that customer for a significant period of time.. Furthermore, we do not have long-term contracts with our customers. As a result, our agreements with our customers do not provide assurance of future sales, and we are exposed to competitive price pressures on new orders we attempt to obtain.. Our customer base is also highly concentrated in terms of geography, and the majority of our sales are to customers located in a limited number of countries. Dependence upon sales emanating from a limited number of regions increases our risk of exposure to local difficulties and challenges, such as those associated with regional economic downturns, political instability, fluctuating currency exchange rates, natural disasters, social unrest, pandemics, terrorism, and acts of war. Our reliance upon customer demand arising primarily from a limited number of countries could materially and adversely impact our future results of operations.. A further reduction or elimination of foreign government subsidies and economic incentives may adversely affect the future order rate for our MOCVD equipment.. We generate a significant portion of our revenue in China. In recent years, the Chinese government has provided various incentives to encourage the development of the LED industry, including subsidizing a portion of the purchase cost of MOCVD equipment. These subsidies have enabled and encouraged certain customers in this region to purchase more of our MOCVD equipment than these customers might have purchased without these subsidies. The availability and amount of these subsidies has been reduced over time and may end at some point in the future. A further reduction or elimination of these incentives may result in a reduction in future orders for our MOCVD equipment in this region, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, in an effort to promote Chinese competition, the Chinese government could impose restrictions on the receipt of these subsidies, including requirements that the purchased equipment be sourced locally.. A related risk pertains to the fact that many customers use or had planned to use Chinese government subsidies, in addition to other incentives from the Chinese government, to build new manufacturing facilities or to expand existing manufacturing facilities. Delays in the start-up of these facilities or the cancellation of construction plans altogether, together with other related issues pertaining to customer readiness, could adversely impact the timing of our revenue recognition, could result in order cancellations, a reduction in our order backlog, and could have other negative effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. The cyclicality of the industries we serve directly affects our business.. Our business depends in large part upon the capital expenditures of manufacturers in the LED, mobile communication, data storage, and other device markets. We are subject to the business cycles of these industries, the timing, length, and volatility of which are difficult to predict. These industries have historically been highly cyclical and have experienced significant economic downturns in the last decade. As a capital equipment provider, our revenue depends in large part on the spending patterns of these customers, who often delay expenditures or cancel or reschedule orders in reaction to variations in their businesses or general economic conditions. In downturns, we must be able to quickly and effectively align our costs with prevailing market conditions, as well as motivate and retain key employees. However, because a portion of our costs are fixed, our ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to revenue shortfalls may be limited. Downturns in one or more of these industries have had and will likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Alternatively, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to acquire and develop sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand and attract, hire, assimilate, and retain a sufficient number of qualified people. Our net sales and operating results may be negatively affected if our customers experience economic downturns or slowdowns in their businesses.. 16. Table of Contents. The timing of our orders, shipments, and revenue recognition may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly.. We derive a substantial portion of our net sales in any fiscal period from the sale of a relatively small number of high-priced systems. As a result, the timing of recognition of revenue for a single transaction could have a material effect on our sales and operating results for a particular fiscal period. As is typical in our industry, orders, shipments, and customer acceptances often occur during the last few weeks of a quarter. As a result, a delay of only a week or two can impact which period revenue is reported and can cause volatility in our revenue for a given reporting period. Our quarterly results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect this trend to continue. If our orders, shipments, net sales, or operating results in a particular quarter do not meet expectations, our stock price may be adversely affected as well.. Our sales cycle is long and unpredictable.. Historically, we have experienced long and unpredictable sales cycles (the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the time that we recognize revenue for resulting sales to that customer). Our sales cycle can exceed twelve months. The timing of an order often depends on our customer's capital expenditure budget, over which we have no control. In addition, the time it takes us to build a product to customer specifications typically ranges from three to six months. When coupled with the fluctuating amount of time required for shipment, installation, and final acceptance, our sales cycles often vary widely, and these variations can cause fluctuations in our operating results. As a result of our lengthy sales cycles, we may incur significant research, development, selling, general, and administrative expenses before we generate revenue for these products. We may never generate the anticipated revenue if a customer cancels or otherwise changes its purchase plans, which could have an adverse effect on our business.. Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification which could result in decreased sales, increased inventory obsolescence, and liabilities to our suppliers for products no longer needed.. Customer purchase orders may be cancelled or rescheduled by the customer, sometimes with limited or no penalties, which may result in increased or unrecoverable costs for the Company. We adjust our backlog for such cancellations, contract modifications, and delivery delays that result in a delivery period in excess of one year, among other items. A downturn in one or more of our businesses could result in an increase in order cancellations and postponements.. We write-off excess and obsolete inventory based on historical trends, future usage forecasts, and other factors including the amount of backlog we have on hand. If our backlog is canceled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated the write-off required for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize associated costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. In addition, we place orders with our suppliers based on our customers' orders. If our customers cancel their orders with us, we may not be able to cancel our orders with our suppliers. Any such charges could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition.. Our failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in inventory obsolescence, liabilities to our suppliers for products no longer needed, and manufacturing interruptions or delays which could affect our ability to meet customer demand.. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to accurately forecast and supply equipment and services that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of our customers. To meet these demands, we depend on the timely delivery of parts, components, and subassemblies from our suppliers. Uncertain worldwide economic conditions and market instabilities make it difficult for us (and our customers) to accurately forecast future product demand. If actual demand for our products is different than expected, we may purchase more or fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing, or expediting delivery of parts. If we overestimate the demand for our products, excess inventory could result which could be subject to heavy price discounting, which could become obsolete, and which could subject us to liabilities to our suppliers for products no longer needed. Similarly, we may be harmed in the event that our competitors overestimate the demand for their products and engage in heavy price discounting practices as a result. In addition, the volatility of demand for capital equipment increases capital and other risks for companies in our supply chain.. 17. Table of Contents. Furthermore, certain key parts may be subject to long lead-times or may be obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing and assembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the United States. We may experience significant interruptions in our manufacturing operations, delays in our ability to timely deliver products or services, increased costs, or customer order cancellations as a result of:.                   the failure or inability of our suppliers to timely deliver quality parts;.                   volatility in the availability and cost of materials;.                   difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;.                   information technology or infrastructure failures;.                   natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, or storms; or.                   other causes such as regional economic downturns, pandemics, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war, that could result in delayed deliveries, manufacturing inefficiencies, increased costs, or order cancellations.. In addition, in the event of an unanticipated increase in demand for our products, our need to rapidly increase our business and manufacturing capacity may be limited by working capital constraints of our suppliers, which may cause or exacerbate interruptions in our manufacturing and supply chain operations. Any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. Our failure to successfully manage our outsourcing activities or failure of our outsourcing partners to perform as anticipated could adversely affect our results of operations.. To better align our costs with market conditions, increase the percentage of variable costs relative to total costs, and to increase productivity and operational efficiency, we have outsourced certain functions to third parties, including the manufacture of several of our systems. While we maintain some level of internal manufacturing capability for these systems, we rely heavily on our outsourcing partners to perform their contracted functions to allow us flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions, including periods of significantly diminished order volumes. If our outsourcing partners do not perform as required, or if our outsourcing model does not allow us to realize the intended cost savings and flexibility, our results of operations (and those of our third party providers) may be adversely affected. Disputes and possibly litigation involving third party providers could result and we could suffer damage to our reputation. Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing may also adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market. Although we attempt to select reputable providers, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect. If we do not effectively manage our outsourcing strategy or if third party providers do not perform as anticipated, we may not realize the benefits of productivity improvements and we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs, manufacturing and installation interruptions or delays, inefficiencies in the structure and operation of our supply chain, loss of intellectual property rights, quality issues, increased product time-to-market, and an inefficient allocation of our human resources, any or all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. We rely on a limited number of suppliers, some of whom are our sole source for particular components.. Certain of the parts, components, and sub-assemblies included in our products are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers. Our inability to develop alternative sources, as necessary, could result in a prolonged interruption in our ability to supply related products, a failure on our part to meet the demands our customers, and a significant increase in the price of related products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. Our inability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.. Our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees, including those in executive, managerial, finance, engineering, and marketing positions, as well as highly skilled and qualified technical personnel. Attracting, retaining, and motivating such qualified personnel may be difficult due to challenging industry conditions, competition for such personnel by other technology companies, consolidations and relocations of operations, and workforce reductions, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in recruiting or retaining key personnel. We have entered. 18. Table of Contents. into employment agreements with certain key personnel but our inability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. We are exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions, and strategic investments.. We have completed several significant acquisitions and investments in the past and we will consider new opportunities in the future. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, many of which are unpredictable and beyond our control, including the following:.                   difficulties and increased costs in integrating the personnel, operations, technologies, and products of acquired companies;.                   diversion of management's attention and disruption of ongoing businesses;.                   the inability to complete proposed transactions as anticipated, resulting in obligations to pay professional and other expenses, including any applicable termination fees;.                   potential loss of key employees of acquired companies, especially if a relocation or change in responsibilities is involved;.                   difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations in a cost effective manner;.                   the failure to realize expected synergies;.                   unknown, underestimated, and undisclosed commitments or liabilities;.                   increased amortization expenses relating to intangible assets; and.                   other adverse effects on our business, including the potential impairment and write-down of amounts capitalized as intangible assets and goodwill as part of the acquisition, as a result of such matters as technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance by the acquired company.. As discussed above with respect to our recent acquisition of Ultratech, our inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, if we issue equity securities to pay for an acquisition or investment, the ownership percentage of our then-current shareholders would be reduced and the value of the shares held by these shareholders could be diluted, which could adversely affect the price of our stock. If we use cash to pay for an acquisition or investment, the payment could significantly reduce the cash that would be available to fund our operations or other purposes, which could have a negative effect on our business.. We may be unable to obtain required export licenses for the sale of our products.. Products which are either manufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology are subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (\"EAR\") when exported to and re-exported from international jurisdictions, in addition to the local jurisdiction's export regulations applicable to individual shipments. Currently, our MOCVD, MBE, and certain other systems and products are controlled for export under the EAR. Licenses or proper license exceptions may be required for the shipment of our products to certain customers or countries. Obtaining an export license or determining whether an export license exception exists often requires considerable effort by us and cooperation from the customer, which can add time to the order fulfillment process. We may be unable to obtain required export licenses or unable to qualify for export license exceptions and, as a result, we may be unable to export products to our customers. The administrative processing, potential delay and risk of ultimately not obtaining required export approvals pose a particular disadvantage to us relative to our non-U.S. competitors who are not required to comply with U.S. export controls. Non-compliance with the EAR or other applicable export regulations could result in a wide range of penalties including the denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of commodities. In the event that an export regulatory body determines that any of our shipments violate applicable export regulations, we could be fined significant sums and our export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.. 19. Table of Contents. Our operating results may be adversely affected by tightening credit markets.. As a global company with worldwide operations, we are subject to volatility and adverse consequences associated with economic downturns in different parts of the world. In the event of a downturn, many of our customers may delay or further reduce their purchases of our products and services. If negative conditions in the credit markets prevent our customers from obtaining credit or necessary financing, product orders in these channels may decrease, which could result in lower revenue. In addition, we may experience cancellations of orders in backlog, rescheduling of customer deliveries, and attendant pricing pressures. If our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit, in selling their products, or otherwise in operating their businesses, their ability to continue to supply materials to us may be negatively affected.. In addition, we finance some of our sales through trade credit. In addition to ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition, we seek to mitigate our credit risk by obtaining deposits and letters of credit on certain of our sales arrangements. We could suffer significant losses if a customer whose accounts receivable we have not secured fails or is otherwise unable to pay us, or if financial institutions providing letters of credit become insolvent. A loss in collections on our accounts receivable would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.. We may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar laws.. We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\"FCPA\") and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government officials, as defined by the statute, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, many of our customers have policies limiting or prohibiting us from providing certain types or amounts of entertainment, meals, or gifts to their employees. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees and representatives. However, our safeguards may prove to be ineffective and our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors may engage in conduct for which we may be held responsible. In addition, we may acquire a company that has engaged in unlawful conduct in the past, and be held responsible for this conduct through successor liability principles. Violations of the FCPA or similar laws or similar customer policies may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions or the loss of supplier privileges to a customer and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. We are subject to internal control evaluations and attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any delays or difficulties in satisfying these requirements or negative reports concerning our internal controls could adversely affect our future results of operations and our stock price.. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we must include in our Annual Report on Form 10-K a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Ongoing compliance with this requirement is complex, costly, time-consuming, and is subject to significant judgment. If our internal controls are ineffective or if our management does not timely assess the adequacy of such internal controls, our ability to file timely and accurate periodic reports may be impeded. Any delays in filing may cause us to face the following risks and concerns, among others:.                   concern on the part of our customers, partners, investors, and employees about our financial condition and filing delay status, including the potential loss of business opportunities;.                   significant time and expense required to complete delayed filings and the distraction of our senior management team and board of directors as we work to complete delayed filings;.                   investigations by the SEC and other regulatory authorities of the Company and our management;.                   limitations on our ability to raise capital;.                   suspension or termination of our stock listing on The NASDAQ Stock Market and the removal of our stock as a component of certain stock market indices; and.                   general reputational harm.. Any or all of the foregoing could result in the commencement of stockholder lawsuits against the Company. Any such litigation, as well as any proceedings that could arise as a result of a filing delay and the circumstances which gave rise to it, may be time consuming and expensive, may divert management attention from the conduct of our business, could have a. 20. Table of Contents. material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and may expose us to costly indemnification obligations to current or former officers, directors, or other personnel, regardless of the outcome of such matters, which may not be adequately covered by insurance.. Changes in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our financial results.. Changes in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results. New accounting pronouncements and taxation rules can have a material impact on effective tax rates, results of operations, and our financial condition. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the statute commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"2017 Tax Act\"), which makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code. As we collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret the 2017 Tax Act and any additional guidance issued by the IRS or other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\"), which provides SEC staff guidance for the application of ASC 740 in the reporting period in which the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. This change could materially affect our financial position and tax attributes carryforward. In addition, varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation practices, and the questioning of our current or past practices (such as those associated with our transfer pricing), may adversely affect our reported financial results.. Our income taxes may change.. We are subject to income tax on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis and significant judgment is required in certain instances to allocate our taxable income to a jurisdiction and to determine the related income tax expense and benefits. Losses in one jurisdiction generally may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions. As a result, changes in the mix of our earnings (or losses) between jurisdictions, among other factors, could alter our overall effective income tax rate, possibly resulting in significant tax rate increases.. We are regularly audited by various tax authorities. Income tax audit assessments or changes in tax laws, regulations, or other interpretations may result in increased tax provisions which could materially affect our operating results in the period or periods in which such determinations are made or changes occur.. In addition, our effective tax rate could increase if we determine that it is no longer more likely than not that we are able to realize our remaining net deferred tax assets, if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions, or if we are otherwise required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets.. We may be required to take additional impairment charges on assets.. We are required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment, or on an interim basis whenever certain events occur or circumstances change, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. We are also required to test our long-lived assets, including acquired intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, for recoverability and impairment whenever there are indicators of impairment such as an adverse change in business climate.. As part of our long term strategy, we may pursue future acquisitions of other companies or assets which could potentially increase our assets. Adverse changes in business conditions could materially impact our estimates of future operations and result in impairment charges to these assets. A significant decline in the market price of our common stock could indicate a decline in the fair value of our reporting unit such that goodwill becomes impaired. If our assets are impaired, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.. We have indebtedness in the form of convertible senior notes which could adversely affect our financial position, prevent us from implementing our strategy, and dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders.. In January of 2017, we issued $345 million of 2.70% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (\"Convertible Senior Notes\"). The Convertible Senior Notes are convertible into Company common stock at an initial conversion rate of 24.98 shares of Company common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes. The Company is obligated to repurchase the Convertible Senior Notes upon the occurrence of certain events described in the indenture relating to the Convertible Senior Notes. The degree to which we are leveraged could have negative consequences, including but not limited to the following:. 21. Table of Contents.                   we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, less able to withstand competitive pressures, and less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions;.                   our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate, and other purposes may be limited;.                   a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations in the future may be required for the payment of the principal amount of our existing indebtedness when it becomes due; and.                   we may elect to make cash payments upon any conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes, which would reduce our cash on hand.. Our ability to meet our payment obligations under the Convertible Senior Notes depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in an amount sufficient for us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.. Furthermore, if the Convertible Senior Notes are converted into shares of Company common stock, the issuance of additional shares of Company common stock would dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders and could have a dilutive effect on our net income per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of the Convertible Senior Notes. In addition, any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.. The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Convertible Senior Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.. Under Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (\"ASC 470-20\"), an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of certain convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Senior Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer's economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Convertible Senior Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Convertible Senior Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Convertible Senior Notes to their face amount over the term of the Convertible Senior Notes. We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period's amortization of the debt discount and the instrument's coupon interest, which could adversely affect our financial results, the trading price of our common stock, and the trading price of the Convertible Senior Notes.. In addition, under certain circumstances convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Senior Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash can be accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Convertible Senior Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method or that we will continue to expect to settle the principal balance in cash. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes, our diluted earnings per share could be adversely affected.. 22. Table of Contents. We are subject to foreign currency exchange risks.. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks that are inherent in our anticipated sales, sales and purchase commitments, and assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Although we attempt to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, hedging activities may not always be available or adequate to mitigate the impact of our exchange rate exposure. Failure to sufficiently hedge or otherwise manage foreign currency risks properly could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.. Our previously announced share repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.. Repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a share repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long term stockholder value, short term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program's effectiveness. Furthermore, the program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time and any suspension or discontinuation could cause the market price of our stock to decline.. If we are subject to cyber-attacks we could incur substantial costs and, if such attacks are successful, we could incur significant liabilities, reputational harm, and disruption to our operations.. We manage, store, and transmit proprietary information and sensitive data relating to our operations. We may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use for these purposes. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate and compromise our confidential information (and third party confidential information), create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or our products, or that otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities.. The costs to address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, a cessation of service, and a loss of existing or potential customers, impeding our sales, manufacturing, distribution, and other critical functions. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive data about us, our customers or other third parties, could expose us, our customers and others to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, and otherwise harm our business.. We have adopted certain measures that may have anti-takeover effects which may make an acquisition of our Company by another company more difficult.. We have adopted, and may in the future adopt, certain measures that may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a takeover or other change in control of our Company, which a holder of our common stock might not consider to be in the holder's best interest. These measures include:.                   \"blank check\" preferred stock;.                   a classified board of directors; and.                   certain other certificate of incorporation and bylaws provisions.. Our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights (including voting rights), preferences and privileges of these shares (\"blank check\" preferred). Such preferred stock may have rights, including economic rights, senior to our common stock. As a result, the issuance of the preferred stock could have a material adverse. 23. Table of Contents. effect on the price of our common stock and could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock.. Our board of directors is divided into three classes with each class serving a staggered three-year term. The existence of a classified board makes it more difficult for our shareholders to change the composition of our board of directors, and therefore the Company's policies, in a relatively short period of time.. We have adopted certain certificate of incorporation and bylaws provisions which have anti-takeover effects. These include: (a) requiring certain actions to be taken at a meeting of shareholders rather than by written consent, (b) requiring a super-majority of shareholders to approve certain amendments to our bylaws, (c) limiting the maximum number of directors, and (d) providing that directors may be removed only for \"cause.\" These measures and those described above may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a takeover or other change in control of our Company that a holder of our common stock might consider to be in the holder's best interest.. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination, including mergers and asset sales, with an interested stockholder (generally, a 15% or greater stockholder) for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The operation of Section 203 may have anti-takeover effects, which could delay, defer, or prevent a takeover attempt that a holder of our common stock might consider to be in the holder's best interest.. Despite the above measures, an activist shareholder could undertake action to implement governance, strategic, or other changes to the Company which a holder of our common stock might not consider to be in the holder's best interest. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plans, be costly and time consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of management and our employees.. We are subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental, health, and safety regulations.. We are subject to environmental, health, and safety regulations in connection with our business operations, including but not limited to regulations related to the development, manufacture and use of our products, recycling and disposal of related materials, and the operation and use of our facilities and real property. Failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, could result in significant remediation liabilities, the imposition of fines, and the suspension or termination of research, development, or use of certain of our products, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, some of our operations involve the storage, handling, and use of hazardous materials that may pose a risk of fire, explosion, or environmental release. Such events could result from acts of terrorism, natural disasters, or operational failures and may result in injury or loss of life to our employees and others, local environmental contamination, and property damage. These events might cause a temporary shutdown of an affected facility, or portion thereof, and we could be subject to penalties or claims as a result. Each of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. Regulations related to conflict minerals will force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex, and may harm our relationships with customers.. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\"), the SEC adopted requirements for companies that manufacture products that contain certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals. These rules require public companies to perform diligence and to report annually to the SEC whether such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals we use in the manufacture of our products. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. Given the complexity of our supply chain, we may not be able to ascertain the origins of these minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that our products be certified as conflict mineral free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and lead to a loss of revenue. These requirements could limit the pool of suppliers that can provide conflict-free minerals, and we may be unable. 24. Table of Contents. to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.. We have significant operations in locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, or other significant disruption.. Our operations in the United States, in the Asia-Pacific region, and in other areas could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including earthquakes, tsunamis, fires, hurricanes, floods, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, and other natural and manmade disasters or disruptions. In the event of such a natural disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations and to the operations of our suppliers, distributors, resellers and customers, destruction of facilities and loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, various regions of the world in which we do business are subject to the threat of terrorism and acts of war. Any act of terrorism or war that affects the economy or the industries in which we operate could result in significant harm to us, including the loss of life and property, manufacturing and transportation delays, disruptions in our supply chain, the need to comply with enhanced security measures, and other increased costs."
