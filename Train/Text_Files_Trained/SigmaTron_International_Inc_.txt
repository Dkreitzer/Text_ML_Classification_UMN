[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. <U+FEFF>. The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operations, industry or financial position or our future financial performance.  While the Company believes it has identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting its business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect its business, operations, industry, financial position and financial performance in the future.. <U+FEFF>. The Company's ability to secure and maintain sufficient credit arrangements is key to its continued operations.. <U+FEFF>. Prior to March 31, 2017 the Company had a senior secured credit facility with Wells Fargo, N.A. with a revolving credit limit up to $30,000,000.  The credit facility was collateralized by substantially all of the Company's domestically located assets and the Company had pledged 65% of its equity ownership interest in some of its foreign entities.  Prior to its payoff and termination, the Wells Fargo, N.A. senior secured credit facility was due to expire on October 31, 2018.  On March 31, 2017, the Company paid the balance outstanding under the senior revolving credit facility in the amount of $22,232,914.  The remaining deferred financing costs of $68,475 were expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.. <U+FEFF>. 10. On March 31, 2017, the Company entered into a $35,000,000 senior secured credit facility with U.S. Bank, National Association (\"U.S. Bank\"), which expires on March 31, 2022.  The credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of the Company's domestically located assets. The facility allows the Company to choose among interest rates at which it may borrow funds:  the bank fixed rate of four percent or LIBOR plus one and one half percent (effectively 3.83% at April 30, 2018).  Interest is due monthly.  Under the senior secured credit facility, the Company may borrow up to the lesser of (i) $35,000,000 or (ii) an amount equal to a percentage of the eligible receivable borrowing base plus a percentage of the eligible inventory borrowing base (the \"Borrowing Base\").  Deferred financing costs of $34,971 and $207,647 were capitalized in the twelve month period ending April 30, 2018 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, which are amortized over the term of the agreement.  As of April  30, 2018 and April 30, 2017 the unamortized amount included in other assets was $192,502 and $204,186, respectively.    As of April 30, 2018, there was $29,279,631 outstanding and $5,720,369 of unused availability under the U.S. Bank facility compared to an outstanding balance of $23,178,429 and $11,821,571 of unused availability at April 30, 2017.  At April 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenant and other restricted covenants under the credit facility.. <U+FEFF>. On July 16, 2018, the Company and U.S. Bank entered into an amendment of the revolving credit facility.  The amended revolving credit facility allows the Company to borrow up to the lesser of (i) $45,000,000 less reserves or (ii) 90% of the Company's Borrowing Base, except that the 90% limitation will expire if the Company's actual revolving loans for the first 90 days after the amendment's effective date are less than 80% of the Company's Borrowing Base and the Company maintains a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.2 to 1.0 for four consecutive quarters.  The amendment also imposes sublimits on categories of inventory equal to $17,500,000 on raw materials and $25,000,000 on finished goods.. <U+FEFF>. On August 4, 2015, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Wujiang SigmaTron Electronics Co., Ltd., entered into a credit facility with China Construction Bank.  Under the agreement Wujiang SigmaTron Electronics Co., Ltd. could borrow up to 5,000,000 Renminbi and the facility was collateralized by Wujiang SigmaTron Electronics Co., Ltd.'s manufacturing building.  Interest was payable monthly and the facility had a fixed interest rate of 6.67%.  The facility was due to expire on August 3, 2017.  The credit facility was closed as of March 1, 2017.. <U+FEFF>. On March 24, 2017, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, SigmaTron Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., entered into a credit facility with China Construction Bank.  Under the agreement SigmaTron Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. could borrow up to 9,000,000 Renminbi and the facility was collateralized by Wujiang SigmaTron Electronics Co., Ltd.'s manufacturing building.  Interest was payable monthly and the facility had a fixed interest rate of 6.09%.  The term of the facility extended to February 7, 2018.  The credit facility was closed as of February 11, 2018.  There was no outstanding balance under the facility at April 30, 2017.. <U+FEFF>. On February 12, 2018, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, SigmaTron Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., entered into a credit facility with China Construction Bank.  Under the agreement SigmaTron Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. can borrow up to 5,000,000 Renminbi and the facility is collateralized by Wujiang SigmaTron Electronics Co., Ltd.'s manufacturing building.  Interest is payable monthly and the facility bears a fixed interest rate of 6.09%.  The term of the facility extends to February 7, 2019.  There was no outstanding balance under the facility at April  30, 2018.. <U+FEFF>. The Company anticipates that its credit facilities, cash flow from operations and leasing resources are adequate to meet its working capital requirements and capital expenditures for fiscal year 2019. In addition, in the event the Company desires to expand its operations, its business grows more rapidly than expected, the current economic climate deteriorates, customers delay payments, or the Company desires to consummate an acquisition, additional financing resources may be necessary in the current or future fiscal years.  There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain equity or debt financing at acceptable terms, or at all, in the future.  There is no assurance that the Company will be able to retain or renew its credit agreements in the future, or that any retention or renewal will be on the same terms as currently exist.. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. 11. Adverse changes in the economy or political conditions could negatively impact the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. The Company's sales and gross margins depend significantly on market demand for its customers' products.  The uncertainty in the U.S. and international economic and political environments could result in a decline in demand for our customers' products in any industry.  Further, any adverse changes in tax rates and laws affecting our customers could result in decreasing gross margins.  Any of these factors could negatively impact the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. The Company experiences variable operating results.. <U+FEFF>. The Company's results of operations have varied and may continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period, including on a quarterly basis.  Consequently, results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period, and fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of the Company's common stock.. <U+FEFF>. The Company's quarterly and annual results may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, many of which are beyond the Company's control.  Some of these factors include:. <U+FEFF>. -          changes in sales mix to customers. -          changes in availability and rising component costs. -          volume of customer orders relative to capacity. -          market demand and acceptance of our customers' products. -          price erosion within the EMS marketplace. -          capital equipment requirements needed to remain technologically competitive. -          volatility in the U.S. and international economic and financial markets. <U+FEFF>. The Company's customer base is concentrated.. <U+FEFF>. Sales to the Company's five largest customers accounted for 50.2% and 55.2% of net sales for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  For the year ended April 30, 2018, two customers accounted for 20.2% and 13.3% of net sales of the Company, and 6.0% and 2.9%, respectively, of accounts receivable at April 30, 2018.  For the year ended April 30, 2017, two customers accounted for 26.7% and 12.6% of net sales of the Company and 8.4% and 4.2%, respectively, of accounts receivable at April 30, 2017.  Significant reductions in sales to any of the Company's major customers or the loss of a major customer could have a material impact on the Company's operations.  If the Company cannot replace cancelled or reduced orders, sales will decline, which could have a material impact on the results of operations.  There can be no assurance that the Company will retain any or all of its largest customers.  This risk may be further complicated by pricing pressures and intense competition prevalent in our industry.. <U+FEFF>. If any of the Company's customers have financial difficulties, the Company could encounter delays or defaults in the payment of amounts owed for accounts receivable and inventory obligations.  This could have a significant adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. Most of the Company's customers do not commit to long-term production schedules, which makes it difficult to schedule production and achieve maximum efficiency at the Company's manufacturing facilities and manage inventory levels.. <U+FEFF>. The volume and timing of sales to the Company's customers may vary due to:. <U+FEFF>. -          customers' attempts to manage their inventory. -          variation in demand for the Company's customers' products. -          design changes, or. -          acquisitions of or consolidation among customers. <U+FEFF>. Many of the Company's customers do not commit to firm production schedules.  The Company's inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty can make it difficult to schedule production and maximize. 12. utilization of manufacturing capacity and manage inventory levels.  The Company could be required to increase or decrease staffing and more closely manage other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand of its customers.  Orders from the Company's customers could be cancelled or delivery schedules could be deferred as a result of changes in our customers' demand, thereby adversely affecting the Company's results of operations in any given quarter.. <U+FEFF>. The Company and its customers may be unable to keep current with the industry's technological changes.. <U+FEFF>. The market for the Company's manufacturing services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing product development.  The future success of the Company's business will depend in large part upon our customers' ability to maintain and enhance their technological capabilities, develop and market manufacturing services which meet changing customer needs and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost-effective and timely basis.. <U+FEFF>. Our customers have competitive challenges, including rapid technological changes, pricing pressure and decreasing demand from their customers, which could adversely affect their business and the Company's.. <U+FEFF>. Factors affecting the industries that utilize our customers' products could negatively impact our customers and the Company.  These factors include:. <U+FEFF>. -          increased competition among our customers and their competitors. -          the inability of our customers to develop and market their products. -          recessionary periods in our customers' markets. -          the potential that our customers' products become obsolete. -          our customers' inability to react to rapidly changing technology. <U+FEFF>. Any such factor or a combination of factors could negatively impact our customers' need for or ability to pay for our products, which could, in turn, affect the Company's results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Adverse market conditions could reduce our future sales and earnings per share.. <U+FEFF>. Uncertainty over the erosion of global consumer confidence amidst concerns about volatile energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, declining asset values, inflation, rising unemployment, and the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial markets, businesses, and sovereign nations has slowed global economic growth and resulted in recessions in many countries, including in the United States, Europe and certain countries in Asia over the past several years.  The economic recovery of recent years is fragile and recessionary conditions may return.  Any of these potential negative economic conditions may reduce demand for the Company's customers' products and adversely affect the Company's sales.  Consequently, the Company's past operating results, earnings and cash flows may not be indicative of the Company's future operating results, earnings and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. Customer relationships with start-up companies present more risk.. <U+FEFF>. A small portion of the Company's current customer base is comprised of start-up companies.  Customer relationships with start-up companies may present heightened risk due to the lack of product history.  Slow market acceptance of their products could result in demand fluctuations causing inventory levels to rise.  Further, the current economic environment could make it difficult for such emerging companies to obtain additional funding.  This may result in additional credit risk including, but not limited to, the collection of trade account receivables and payment for their inventory.  If the Company does not have adequate allowances recorded, the results of operations may be negatively affected.. <U+FEFF>. The Company faces intense industry competition and downward pricing pressures.. <U+FEFF>. The EMS industry is highly fragmented and characterized by intense competition.  Many of the Company's competitors have greater experience, as well as greater manufacturing, purchasing, marketing and financial resources than the Company.  Competition from existing or potential new competitors may have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.  The introduction of. 13. lower priced competitive products, significant price reductions by the Company's competitors or significant pricing pressures from its customers could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. The Company has foreign operations that may pose additional risks.. <U+FEFF>. The Company has substantial manufacturing operations in multiple countries.  Therefore, the Company's foreign businesses and results of operations are dependent upon numerous related factors, including the stability of the foreign economies, the political climate, relations with the United States, prevailing worker wages, the legal authority of the Company to operate and expand its business in a foreign country, and the ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified personnel and operating management in Mexico, China and Vietnam.. <U+FEFF>. The Company obtains many of its materials and components through its IPO in Taipei, Taiwan.  The Company's access to these materials and components is dependent on the continued viability of its Asian suppliers.. <U+FEFF>. Approximately 14.0% of the total non-current consolidated assets of the Company are located in foreign jurisdictions outside the United States as of April 30, 2018 and 2017.. <U+FEFF>. Disclosure and internal controls may not detect all errors or fraud.. <U+FEFF>. The Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believe that the Company's disclosure controls and internal controls may not prevent all errors and all fraud.  The Company's disclosure controls and internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance that the procedures will meet the control objectives.  Controls are limited in their effectiveness by human error, including faulty judgments in decision-making.  Further, controls can be circumvented by collusion of two or more people or by management override of controls.. <U+FEFF>. Inadequate internal control over financial reporting could result in a reduction in the value of our common stock.. <U+FEFF>. If the Company identifies and reports a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting, shareholders and the Company's lenders could lose confidence in the reliability of the Company's financial statements.  This could have a material adverse impact on the value of the Company's stock and the Company's liquidity.. <U+FEFF>. There is a risk of fluctuation of various currencies integral to the Company's operations.. <U+FEFF>. The Company purchases some of its material components and funds some of its operations in foreign currencies.  From time to time the currencies fluctuate against the U.S. Dollar.  Such fluctuations could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations and performance.  The impact of currency fluctuations for the year ended April 30, 2018 resulted in net foreign currency transaction gains of approximately $125,000 compared to net foreign currency losses of $508,000 in the prior year.  These fluctuations are expected to continue and could have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations.  The Company did not, and is not expected to, utilize derivatives or hedge foreign currencies to reduce the risk of such fluctuations.. <U+FEFF>. The availability of raw components or an increase in their price may affect the Company's operations and profits.. <U+FEFF>. The Company relies on numerous third-party suppliers for components used in the Company's production process.  Certain of these components are available only from single-sources or a limited number of suppliers.  In addition, a customer's specifications may require the Company to obtain components from a single-source or a small number of suppliers.  The loss of any such suppliers could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations.  Further, the Company could operate at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who have greater buying power from suppliers.  The Company does not enter into long-term purchase agreements with major or single-source suppliers, but the Company frequently places cancellable scheduled purchase orders. 14. with suppliers that extend out as far as one year.  The current component market place is tight, with lead times for many common components extending out 36 weeks or more.  The Company's orders for components are always based on the changing needs of its customers.. <U+FEFF>. The Company depends on management and skilled personnel.. <U+FEFF>. The Company depends significantly on its President/CEO and other executive officers.  The Company's employees generally are not bound by employment agreements and the Company cannot assure that it will retain its executive officers or skilled personnel.  The loss of the services of any of these key employees could have a material impact on the Company's business and results of operations.  In addition, despite significant competition, continued growth and expansion of the Company's EMS business will require that the Company attract, motivate and retain additional skilled and experienced personnel.  The Company's future growth depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives and skilled, experienced employees. The Company's future growth also depends on its ability to recruit and retain high-quality employees. A failure to obtain or retain the number of skilled employees necessary to support the Company's efforts, a loss of key employees or a significant shortage of skilled, experienced employees could jeopardize its ability to meet its growth targets.. <U+FEFF>. Favorable labor relations are important to the Company.. <U+FEFF>. The Company currently has labor union contracts with its employees constituting approximately 45% and 50% of its workforce for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Although the Company believes its labor relations are good, any labor disruptions, whether union-related or otherwise, could significantly impair the Company's business, substantially increase the Company's costs or otherwise have a material impact on the Company's results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Failure to comply with environmental regulations could subject the Company to liability.. <U+FEFF>. The Company is subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during its manufacturing process.  To date, the cost to the Company of such compliance has not had a material impact on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.  However, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur in the future as a result of human error, equipment failure or other causes.  Further, the Company cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of environmental legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted.  Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, could require substantial expenditures by the Company and could have a material impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.  Any failure by the Company to comply with present or future regulations could subject it to future liabilities or the suspension of production which could have a material negative impact on the Company's results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Conflict minerals regulations may cause the Company to incur additional expenses and could increase the cost of components contained in its products and adversely affect its inventory supply chain.. <U+FEFF>. The Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") thereunder, requires the Company to determine and report annually whether any conflict minerals contained in our products originated from the DRC or an adjoining country. The Dodd-Frank Act and these rules could affect our ability to source components that contain conflict minerals at acceptable prices and could impact the availability of conflict minerals, since there may be only a limited number of suppliers of conflict-free conflict minerals. Our customers may require that our products contain only conflict-free conflict minerals, and our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted if we are unable to meet this requirement at a reasonable price or are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting this requirement. Additionally, the Company may suffer reputational harm with our customers and other stakeholders if our products are not conflict-free.  The Company could incur significant costs in the event we are unable to manufacture products that contain only conflict-free conflict minerals or to the extent that we are required to make changes to products, processes, or sources of supply due to the foregoing requirements or pressures.. <U+FEFF>. 15. The price of the Company's stock is volatile.. <U+FEFF>. The price of the Company's common stock historically has experienced significant volatility due to fluctuations in the Company's revenue and earnings, other factors relating to the Company's operations, the market's changing expectations for the Company's growth, overall equity market conditions and other factors unrelated to the Company's operations.  In addition, the limited float of the Company's common stock and the limited number of market makers also affect the volatility of the Company's common stock.  Such fluctuations are expected to continue in the future.. <U+FEFF>. An adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. The Company pays interest on outstanding borrowings under its senior secured credit facility and certain other long-term debt obligations at interest rates that fluctuate.  An adverse change in the Company's interest rates could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Changes in securities laws and regulations may increase costs.. <U+FEFF>. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and listing requirements subsequently adopted by Nasdaq in response to Sarbanes-Oxley, have required changes in corporate governance practices, internal control policies and securities disclosure and compliance practices of public companies.  More recently the Dodd-Frank Act requires changes to our corporate governance, compliance practices and securities disclosures.  Compliance following the implementation of these rules has increased our legal, financial and accounting costs.  The Company expects increased costs related to these new regulations to continue, including, but not limited to, legal, financial and accounting costs.  These developments may result in the Company having difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified members of the board or qualified officers.  Further, the costs associated with the compliance with and implementation of procedures under these laws and related rules could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Any litigation, even where a claim is without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.. <U+FEFF>. In the past, the Company has been notified of claims relating to various matters including intellectual property rights, contractual matters, labor issues or other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.  In the event of any such claim, the Company may be required to spend a significant amount of money and resources, even where the claim is without merit.  Accordingly, the resolution of such disputes, even those encountered in the ordinary course of business, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, consolidated financial conditions and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. If the security of the Company's systems is breached or otherwise subjected to unauthorized access, the Company's reputation may be severely harmed and it may be exposed to liability.. <U+FEFF>. The Company's system stores confidential information which includes its financial information,  its customers' proprietary email distribution lists, product information, supplier information, and other critical data.  Any accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access could expose the Company to liability for the loss of such information, adverse regulatory action by federal and state governments, time-consuming and expensive litigation and other possible liabilities as well as negative publicity, which could severely damage the Company's reputation.  If security measures are breached because of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, or if design flaws in its software are exposed and exploited, and, as a result, a third party obtains unauthorized access to any of its customers' data, its relationships with its customers may be severely damaged, and the Company could incur significant liability.  Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, the Company and its third-party hosting facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.  In addition, many states have enacted laws requiring companies to notify customers of data security breaches involving their data.  These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause the Company's customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of its data security measures.  Any security breach whether. 16. actual or perceived, could harm the Company's reputation, could cause it to lose customers and may negatively impact its ability to acquire new customers.. <U+FEFF>. With the increased use of technologies such as the Internet to conduct business, a company is susceptible to operational, information security and related risks. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyberattacks include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (e.g., through \"hacking\" or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption (e.g., ransomware attacks). Cyberattacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (i.e., efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Cyber incidents affecting the Company or its service providers have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses, interference with the Company's ability to conduct business in the ordinary course, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, additional compliance costs and, in extreme cases, have caused companies to cease doing business. Cyber events also can affect counterparties or clients with which the Company does business, governmental and other regulatory authorities, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions, among others. In addition, substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future. While the Company has established risk management systems to prevent such cyber incidents, there are inherent limitations in such systems including the possibility that the Company has not prepared for certain risks that have not been or are not possible to have been identified. Further, the Company may be able to influence, but cannot control, the cyber security plans and systems put in place by its service providers or any other third parties whose operations may affect the Company. The Company could be negatively impacted as a result.. <U+FEFF>. Changes in US trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. The US government has indicated its intent to adopt a new approach to trade policy and in some cases to renegotiate, or potentially terminate, certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements.  It has also initiated tariffs on certain foreign goods, including steel and aluminum and other raw materials utilized by the Company.  Changes in US trade policy could result in one or more of US trading partners adopting responsive trade policy making it more difficult or costly for us to import our products from those countries.  This in turn could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increases prices, result in lowering our margin on products sold.. <U+FEFF>. China and the European Union have imposed tariffs on US products in retaliation for new US tariffs.  Additional tariffs could be imposed by China and the European Union in response to proposed increased tariffs on products imported from China and the European Union.  There is also a concern that the imposition of additional tariffs by the United States could result in the adoption of tariffs by other countries.  The resulting trade war could have a significant adverse effect on world trade and the world economy.  To the extent that trade tariffs and other restrictions imposed by the United States increase the price of, or limit the amount of steel, aluminum and other raw materials utilized by the Company imported into the United States, the costs of our raw materials may be adversely affected and the demand from our customers for products and services may be diminished, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.. <U+FEFF>. We cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impact on our business.  The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the US economy, which in turn could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>"
