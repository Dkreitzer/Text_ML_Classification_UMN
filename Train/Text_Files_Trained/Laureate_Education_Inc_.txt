[1] "ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS. The following are certain risks that could affect our business and our results of operations. The risks identified below are not all encompassing but should be considered in establishing an opinion of our future operations.. Risks Relating to Our Business. We are a global business with operations in more than 20 countries around the world and are subject to complex business, economic, legal, political, tax and foreign currency risks, which risks may be difficult to adequately address.. In each of 2017, 2016 and 2015, over 80% of our revenues were generated from operations outside of the United States. We own or control 52 institutions and manage or have relationships with 11 other licensed institutions in more than 20 countries, each of which is subject to complex business, economic, legal, political, tax and foreign currency risks. As we continue to expand our international operations, we may have difficulty managing and administering a globally dispersed business and we may need to expend additional funds to, among other things, staff key management positions, obtain additional information technology infrastructure and successfully implement relevant course and program offerings for a significant number of international markets, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Additional challenges associated with the conduct of our business overseas that may materially adversely affect our operating results include:. <U+0095> the large size of our network and diverse range of institutions present numerous challenges, including difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, legal and other differences;    <U+0095> each of our institutions is subject to unique business risks and challenges including competitive pressures and diverse pricing environments at the local level;    <U+0095> difficulty maintaining quality standards consistent with our brands and with local accreditation requirements;. 58. Table of Contents. <U+0095> potential economic and political instability in the countries in which we operate, including student unrest;     <U+0095> fluctuations in exchange rates, possible currency devaluations, inflation and hyperinflation;    <U+0095> difficulty selecting, monitoring and controlling partners outside of the United States;    <U+0095> compliance with a wide variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations;    <U+0095> expropriation of assets by governments;    <U+0095> political elections and changes in government policies;    <U+0095> difficulty protecting our intellectual property rights overseas due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty of laws and enforcement in certain countries relating to the protection of intellectual property rights;    <U+0095> lower levels of availability or use of the Internet, through which our online programs are delivered;     <U+0095> limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;    <U+0095> limitations on our ability to realize economic benefits from certain institutions that are organized as not-for-profit or non-stock entities and that we account for as variable interest entities; and    <U+0095> acts of terrorism, public health risks, crime and natural disasters, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations.. Our success in growing our business will depend, in part, on the ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks related to operating in various countries. Any failure by us to effectively manage the challenges associated with the international expansion of our operations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. If we do not effectively manage our growth and business, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.. We have expanded our business through the expansion of existing institutions and the acquisition of higher education institutions, and we intend to continue to do so in the future. We also have established and intend to establish new institutions in certain markets. Planned growth will require us to add management personnel and upgrade our financial and management systems and controls and information technology infrastructure. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain or accelerate the current growth rate, effectively manage expanding operations, build expansion capacity, integrate new institutions or achieve planned growth on a timely or profitable basis. If our revenue growth is less than projected, the costs incurred for these additions and upgrades could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. If we cannot maintain student enrollments in our institutions and maintain tuition levels, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.. Our strategy for growth and profitability depends, in part, upon maintaining and, subsequently, increasing student enrollments in our institutions and maintaining tuition levels. Attrition rates are often due to factors outside our control. Students sometimes face financial, personal or family constraints that require them to drop out of school. They also are affected by economic and social factors prevalent in their countries. In some markets in which we operate, transfers between universities are not common and, as a result, we are less likely to fill spaces of students who drop out. In addition, our ability to attract and retain students may require us to discount tuition from published levels, and. 59. Table of Contents. may prevent us from increasing tuition levels at a rate consistent with inflation and increases in our costs. If we are unable to control the rate of student attrition, our overall enrollment levels are likely to decline or if we are unable to charge tuition rates that are both competitive and cover our rising expenses, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, student enrollment may be negatively affected by our reputation and any negative publicity related to us.. We have incurred net losses in certain prior fiscal years.. We had net income of $93.8 million in 2017, net income of $366.2 million in 2016, and net loss of $315.8 million in 2015. Our operating expenses may increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our operations and the Laureate International Universities network. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues sufficiently to offset any higher expenses. Any failure to increase our revenues could prevent us from attaining profitability. We cannot be certain that we will be able to attain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If we are unable to manage these risks and difficulties effectively as we encounter them, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.. We may not be able to identify, acquire or establish control of, and integrate additional higher education institutions, or effectively integrate previously acquired institutions, which could materially adversely affect our growth.. We have previously relied on, and we expect to continue to rely on, acquisitions as an element of our growth. In 2017, we made one acquisition for $8.3 million, in 2016, we made no acquisitions, in 2015, we made two acquisitions totaling $11.6 million, in 2014, we made three acquisitions totaling $469.2 million, in 2013, we made four acquisitions totaling $321.7 million, in 2012, we made two acquisitions totaling $8.6 million, and in 2011, we made six acquisitions totaling $58.9 million, including debt assumed. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates or that we will be able to acquire or establish control of any acquisition candidate on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, in many countries, the approval of a regulatory agency is needed to acquire or operate a higher education institution, which we may not be able to obtain. Furthermore, there is no assurance that any acquired institution can be integrated into our operations successfully or be operated profitably. Acquisitions involve a number of risks, including:. <U+0095> diversion of management's time and resources;    <U+0095> adverse short-term effects on reported operating results;    <U+0095> competition from other acquirors, which could lead to higher prices and lost opportunities;    <U+0095> cultural issues related to acquisition of closely held institutions in countries around the world;    <U+0095> failures of due diligence during the acquisition process;    <U+0095> integration of acquired institutions' operations, including reporting systems and internal controls; and     <U+0095> loss of key employees of the acquired business.. If we do not make acquisitions or make fewer acquisitions than we have historically, or if our acquisitions are not managed successfully, our growth and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.. 60. Table of Contents. Our divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business, may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions.. We have divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with our strategic direction or growth targets. See \"Item 1 - Business - Recent Developments.\" Divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:. <U+0095> inability to find potential buyers on favorable terms;    <U+0095> failure to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to buyers;    <U+0095> requirements that we indemnify buyers against certain liabilities and obligations;    <U+0095> the possibility that we will become subject to third-party claims arising out of such divestiture;    <U+0095> challenges in identifying and separating the intellectual property and data to be divested from the intellectual property and data that we wish to retain;    <U+0095> inability to reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business;    <U+0095> challenges in collecting the proceeds from any divestiture;    <U+0095> disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; and    <U+0095> loss of key employees who leave the Company as a result of a divestiture.. Because divestitures are inherently risky, our transactions may not be successful and may, in some cases, harm our operating results or financial condition.. Our success depends substantially on the value of the local brands of each of our institutions as well as the Laureate International Universities network brand, which may be materially adversely affected by changes in current and prospective students' perception of our reputation and the use of social media.. Each of our institutions has worked hard to establish the value of its individual brand. Brand value may be severely damaged, even by isolated incidents, particularly if the incidents receive considerable negative publicity. There has been a marked increase in use of social media platforms, including weblogs (blogs), social media websites, and other forms of Internet-based communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience of interested persons. We believe students and prospective employers value readily available information about our institutions and often act on such information without further investigation or authentication, and without regard to its accuracy. In addition, many of our institutions use the Laureate name in promoting their institutions and our success is dependent in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance the value of the Laureate and Laureate International Universities brands. Social media platforms and devices immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on the accuracy of the content posted. Information concerning our company and our institutions may be posted on such platforms and devices at any time. Information posted may be materially adverse to our interests, it may be inaccurate, and it may harm our performance, prospects and business.. Our reputation may be negatively influenced by the actions of other for-profit and private institutions.. In recent years, there have been a number of regulatory investigations and civil litigation matters targeting post-secondary for-profit education institutions in the United States and private higher education institutions in other countries, such as Chile. These investigations and lawsuits have alleged, among other things, deceptive trade practices, false claims against the United States and noncompliance with state and DOE regulations, and breach of the requirement that universities in Chile be operated as not-for-profit institutions. These allegations have attracted adverse media coverage and have been the subject of federal and state legislative hearings and investigations in the United States and in other. 61. Table of Contents. countries. Allegations against the post-secondary for-profit and private education sectors may affect general public perceptions of for-profit and private educational institutions, including institutions in the Laureate International Universities network and us, in a negative manner. Adverse media coverage regarding other for-profit or private educational institutions or regarding us directly or indirectly could damage our reputation, reduce student demand for our programs, materially adversely affect our revenues and operating profit or result in increased regulatory scrutiny.. Growing our online academic programs could be difficult for us.. We anticipate significant future growth from online courses we offer to students, particularly in emerging markets. The expansion of our existing online programs, the creation of new online programs and the development of new fully online or hybrid programs may not be accepted by students or employers, or by government regulators or accreditation agencies. In addition, our efforts may be materially adversely affected by increased competition in the online education market or because of problems with the performance or reliability of our online program infrastructure. There is also increasing development of online programs by traditional universities, both in the public and private sectors, which may have more consumer acceptance than programs we develop, because of lower pricing or greater perception of value of their degrees in the marketplace, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our success depends, in part, on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs in recruiting new students.. In order to maintain and increase our revenues and margins, we must continue to develop our admissions programs and attract new students in a cost-effective manner. As part of our marketing and advertising, we also subscribe to lead-generating databases in certain markets, the cost of which is expected to increase. The level of marketing and advertising and types of strategies used are affected by the specific geographic markets, regulatory compliance requirements and the specific individual nature of each institution and its students. The complexity of these marketing efforts contributes to their cost. If we are unable to advertise and market our institutions and programs successfully, our ability to attract and enroll new students could be materially adversely affected and, consequently, our financial performance could suffer. We use marketing tools such as the Internet, radio, television and print media advertising to promote our institutions and programs. Our representatives also make presentations at upper secondary schools. Additionally, we rely on the general reputation of our institutions and referrals from current students, alumni and employers as a source of new enrollment. Among the factors that could prevent us from marketing and advertising our institutions and programs successfully are the failure of our marketing tools and strategies to appeal to prospective students, regulatory constraints on marketing, current student and/or employer dissatisfaction with our program offerings or results and diminished access to upper secondary campuses. In addition, in certain instances, local regulatory authorities set quotas each year for how many students we may enroll, which may further limit our ability to recruit new students or maintain our present enrollment level. In some of the countries in which we operate, enrollment growth in degree-granting, higher education institutions is slowing or is expected to slow. In order to maintain current growth rates, we will need to attract a larger percentage of students in existing markets and increase our addressable market by adding locations in new markets and rolling out new academic programs. Any failure to accomplish this may have a material adverse effect on our future growth.. 62. Table of Contents. Our institutions are subject to uncertain and varying laws and regulations, and any changes to these laws or regulations or their application to us may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Higher education is regulated to varying degrees and in different ways in each of the countries in which we operate an institution. In general, our institutions must have licenses, approvals, authorizations, or accreditations from various governmental authorities and accrediting bodies. These licenses, approvals, authorizations, and accreditations must be renewed periodically, usually after an evaluation of the institution by the relevant governmental authorities or accrediting bodies. These periodic evaluations could result in limitations, restrictions, conditions, or withdrawal of such licenses, approvals, authorizations or accreditations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In some countries in which we operate, there is a trend toward making continued licensure or accreditation based on successful student outcomes, such as employment, which may be affected by many factors outside of our control. Once licensed, approved, authorized or accredited, some of our institutions may need approvals for new campuses or to add new degree programs.. All of these regulations and their applicable interpretations are subject to change. Moreover, regulatory agencies may scrutinize our institutions because they are owned or controlled by a U.S.-based for-profit corporation. Outside the United States, we may be particularly susceptible to such treatment because, in several of the countries in which we operate, our institutions are among the largest private institutions and have a substantial share of the higher education market. Changes in applicable regulations may cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Changes in laws governing student financing could affect the availability of government-sponsored financing programs for our non-U.S. students, such as the Crédito con Aval del Estado (the \"CAE Program\"), a government-sponsored student loan program in Chile, the Fundo de Financiamento Estudantil (\"FIES\"), a government-sponsored loan program in Brazil, and the Programa Universidade Para Todos (\"PROUNI\") in Brazil, all of which are offered by governments as a means of increasing student access to post-secondary education programs. If those programs are changed, or if our institutions or our students are no longer permitted to participate in those programs, it could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information on the CAE Program, FIES and PROUNI, see \" - If students who avail themselves of government-sponsored student financing programs in certain countries do not graduate and subsequently default on their loans, we may be responsible for repaying a significant portion of their loans\" and \"Item 1 - Business - Industry Regulation - Brazilian Regulation\" and \"Item 1 - Business - Industry Regulation - Chilean Regulation.\" Institutional accreditation is required for new students to be eligible to participate in the CAE Program. If one of our institutions in Chile loses accreditation, new students at that institution would not be eligible to participate in the CAE program. For more information about possible changes in government regulation of higher education in Chile, including possible changes to student financing programs, see \"Item 1 - Business - Industry Regulation - Chilean Regulation - Recent Developments.\" In December 2016, the Australian government introduced a new student loan scheme for vocational courses. These changes, among other things, require relevant vocational education providers to demonstrate a minimum of 50% completion rates, provide for payment of fees monthly in arrears and impose caps on the amounts of loans available for particular categories of courses. See \"Item 1 - Business - Industry Regulation - Other Regulation.\" The Australian vocational operations comply with these requirements but the changes may affect the results of those operations.. For a full description of the laws and regulations affecting our higher education institutions in the United States (\"U.S. Institutions\"), and the impact of those laws and regulations on the operations of our U.S. Institutions, including the ability of our U.S. Institutions to continue to access U.S. federal. 63. Table of Contents. student aid funding sources, see \" - Risks relating to our highly regulated industry in the United States\" and \"Item 1 - Business - Industry Regulation - U.S. Regulation.\". The laws of the countries where we own or control institutions and expect to acquire ownership or control of institutions in the future must permit both private higher education institutions and foreign ownership or control of them. For political, economic or other reasons, a country could decide to change its laws or regulations to prohibit or limit private higher education institutions or foreign ownership or control or prohibit or limit our ability to enter into contracts or agreements with these institutions. If this change occurred, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and we could be forced to sell an institution at a price that could be lower than its fair market value or relinquish control of an institution. A forced sale or relinquishment of control could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Political and regulatory developments in Turkey may materially adversely affect us.. Istanbul Bilgi University (\"Bilgi\"), a member of the Laureate International Universities network located in Turkey, is established as a \"Foundation High Education Institution\" (a \"Foundation University\") under the Turkish higher education law, sponsored by the Bilgi Foundation. As such, it is subject to regulation, supervision and inspection by Turkish Higher Education Council (the \"YÖK\"). Under the \"Ordinance Concerned with Amendment to Foundation High Education Institutions\" (the \"Ordinance\"), the YÖK has authority to inspect accounts, transactions, activities and assets of Foundation Universities, as well as their academic units, programs, projects and subjects. The Ordinance establishes a progressive series of five remedies that the YÖK can take in the event it finds a violation of the Ordinance, ranging from (1) a warning and request for correction to (2) the suspension of the Foundation University's ability to establish new academic units or programs to (3) limiting the number of students the Foundation University can admit, including ceasing new admissions, to (4) provisional suspension of the Foundation University's license to (5) cancellation of the Foundation University's license. Since the promulgation of the Ordinance, the YÖK has canceled the licenses of 15 Foundation Universities.. The Ordinance specifies that Foundation Universities cannot be established by foundations in order to gain profit for themselves, and prohibits specified types of fund transfers from Foundation Universities to their sponsoring foundation, with certain exceptions for payments made under contractual arrangements for various goods and services that are provided at or below current market rates. Bilgi has entered into contractual arrangements with a subsidiary of the Company to provide Bilgi with management, operational and student services and certain intellectual property at fair market rates, and certain affiliates of the Company are members of the board of trustees of the Bilgi Foundation. The YÖK conducts annual audits of the operations of Bilgi. If the YÖK were to determine that any of these contracts or the payments made by Bilgi to this Company subsidiary, or any other activities of Bilgi, including the donation of 40.0 million Turkish Liras made by the university to a charitable foundation that was subsequently reimbursed to the university by certain Company-owned entities, violate the Ordinance or other applicable law, the YÖK could take actions against Bilgi up to and including cancellation of its license.. On April 18, 2017, Bilgi received from the YÖK the results of its 2015-2016 annual audit (the \"2015-2016 Annual Audit\"). The 2015-2016 Annual Audit report required, among other things, that (i) with respect to the 2017-2018 academic year, there be a reduction in the quota for the number of new students permitted to be admitted into Bilgi's degree programs and (ii) Bilgi be reimbursed, not later than October 18, 2017, approximately $29 million for payments previously made by Bilgi to a subsidiary of the Company for certain management, operational and student services, and intellectual property. The Company and Bilgi believe the charges to Bilgi for these services were at fair value and Bilgi has contested the findings of the 2015-2016 Annual Audit that they constituted an improper wealth transfer. Demands also were made in the 2015-2016 Annual Audit for the return or payment to. 64. Table of Contents. Bilgi, by October 18, 2017, of other amounts involving approximately $8 million. These deadlines have been extended to April 16, 2018. In the meantime, the YÖK has been conducting a supplemental audit, the results of which have not been released.. Bilgi has appealed the YÖK's decision in the Turkish court system and has not been reimbursed for any of the payments made to the Company's subsidiary for the services described above. As the Company currently consolidates Bilgi under the variable interest entity model, if the Company is unable to provide services under its contracts with Bilgi and receive the economic benefits from those contracts as a result of the determinations in the 2015-2016 Annual Audit, deconsolidation of Bilgi could be required. Deconsolidation, if required, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations, including possible write-off of all or a portion of the Company's investment in Bilgi and a reduction in operating income. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, Bilgi had total assets of approximately $112 million and $83 million, respectively, and total liabilities of $84 million and $63 million, respectively. Total liabilities include approximately $37 million and $19 million of net intercompany liabilities as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. During fiscal year 2017, Bilgi generated approximately $101 million of the Company's consolidated revenue and approximately $28 million of the Company's consolidated operating income and incurred approximately $6 million of depreciation and amortization expense.. If the YÖK were to determine that any administrators of Bilgi have directly taken any actions or supported any activities that are intended to harm the integrity of the state, the license of the university could be canceled. Political instability in Turkey could lead to changes in laws affecting Bilgi or result in modifications to the current interpretations and enforcement of the Ordinance or other laws and regulations by the YÖK. Any such actions by the YÖK, including the actions in relation to the conduct of the 2015-2016 Annual Audit, or the 2016-2017 annual audit, which is currently taking place, or any supplemental audit, and the reimbursement of amounts described above, could have a material adverse impact on Bilgi's future growth or its ability to remain in operation, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Political and regulatory developments in Chile have materially adversely affected us and may continue to affect us.. On January 24, 2018, a new Higher Education Law (the \"New Law\") was passed by the Chilean Congress and, assuming that it passes review by the Constitutional Court, it is expected to be signed into law by the President of Chile as early as the first quarter of 2018. Among other things, the New Law will prohibit for-profit organizations, such as Laureate, from controlling the boards of universities in Chile. The New Law also prohibits conflicts of interests and related party transactions with notable exceptions, including the provision of services that are educational in nature or essential for the university's purposes. The New Law provides for a transition period between one and two years. The incoming Chilean presidential administration, which took office on March 11, 2018, will have the responsibility to both interpret the legislative mandates and implement new compliance processes.. The Company is currently reviewing the impact the New Law will have on its Chilean operations, including the extent to which it will affect existing contractual relationships that the Company maintains with its Chilean non-profit universities. As a result of the New Law, the Company currently expects that it will be required to deconsolidate its three Chilean non-profit universities, which are accounted for as variable interest entities, and its Chilean real estate subsidiary, although the Company expects it will retain an approximately 30% equity ownership interest in the real estate subsidiary. The deconsolidation could happen as early as the first quarter of 2018. The Company currently expects that the deconsolidation will result in a one-time write-off of the carrying value of the assets of between approximately $600 million and $850 million and a decrease of between approximately $410 million to $430 million in revenues on an annualized basis. In addition, on an annualized basis, the Company. 65. Table of Contents. expects a decrease in operating income of approximately $35 million and a decrease in depreciation and amortization of approximately $35 million, as detailed in the table below:. ($ millions)         Operating  Income (Loss)    Depreciation &  Amortization    Operating  Income (Loss) Plus  Depreciation &  Amortization     Chilean non-profit universities     $ (5 )   $ 25     $ 20    Chilean real estate subsidiary*     $ 40     $ 10     $ 50. *The total impact of $70 million in Operating Income (Loss) Plus Depreciation and Amortization will be partially offset by approximately a $10 million increase in equity in income of affiliates, net of tax.. The Company's continuing evaluation of the impact of the New Law may result in changes to its expectations due to changes in the Company's interpretations of the law, assumptions used, and additional guidance that may be issued. There is no assurance that the New Law will not have additional material adverse effects on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company.. While we believe that all of our institutions in Chile are operating in full compliance with Chilean law, we cannot predict the extent or outcome of any educational reforms that may be implemented in Chile. The Company does not believe the New Law will change its relationship with its two tech/voc institutions in Chile that are for-profit entities. However, it is possible that the Chilean government will adopt additional laws that affect for-profit tech/voc institutions and their relationships with their owners. Depending upon how these reforms are defined and implemented, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Any additional disruption to our operations in Chile would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Similar reforms in other countries in which we operate could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. Regulatory changes in Chile may reduce access to student financing for some of our students in Chile, which could reduce enrollments at our Chilean institutions.. On November 11, 2016, the Chilean Congress passed the 2017 budget law (the \"2017 Budget Law\"). The 2017 Budget Law included changes to the policies for granting free access to higher education and scholarships to students from the first five and seven income deciles who attend certain universities or tech/voc institutions.. For university students, the 2017 Budget Law provided for free access to higher education with the same requirements as were in the previous law but added the requirement that eligible universities have a minimum of 80% of their newly enrolled students with an average result from the national university admissions examination, high school grades and high school rankings above a specified level, and have a transparent admission system that must have been published on the institution's website by December 1, 2016. For tech/voc institutions, the 2017 Budget Law provided for eligibility for free access for students if they were enrolled in institutions (i) organized as not-for-profit legal entities or as for-profit legal entities that have filed for transformation to not-for-profit legal entities under the \"Transformation Law\" passed by the Chilean Congress on November 16, 2016, before December 15, 2016, (ii) accredited for four years or more as of December 23, 2016, (iii) having as controllers not-for-profit legal entities or natural persons, (iv) having stated their intention to participate in the free access system before December 15, 2016, and (v) having a transparent admission system that must have been published on the institution's website by December 1, 2016.. 66. Table of Contents. The 2017 Budget Law also modified the allocations of the Bicentenario Scholarship (\"the BS Program\"). The BS Program supports access to higher education for university students coming from one of the first seven income deciles and covers the full amount of tuition up to an amount authorized by the government. Historically, the BS Program solely benefited students of universities that are members of the Consejo de Rectores de las Universidades Chilenas (the \"CRUCh\"). The 2017 Budget Law terminated the differentiation between CRUCh and non-CRUCh universities for eligibility for the BS Program. Thus, for 2017, 3,500 BS Program scholarships were granted to students at non-CRUCh universities and 3,500 additional BS Program scholarships will be granted to students at non-CRUCh universities in 2018. By 2019, the government promises to have an equal BS Program scholarship policy for all universities, whether CRUCh or non-CRUCh. Students may apply for a BS Program scholarship if their university is accredited for at least four years and if 80% of the university's newly enrolled students have an average result from the national university admissions examination, high school grades and high school rankings above a specified level.. Under the 2017 Budget Law, the NMS II and NMS III are available to all students enrolled in a tech/voc institution, whether for-profit or not-for-profit: (i) NMS II in an amount of CLP 860,000 per year, or up to the effective government-approved tuition fee if it is less than that amount, for students who come from the first five income deciles with an average high school grade of 5.0 and the tech/voc institution in which they are enrolled being accredited for at least three years; and (ii) NMS III, in an amount up to CLP 900,000 per year, or up to the effective government-approved tuition fee if it is less than that amount, provided that such students and the institution in which they enroll meet the requirements for NMS II and the tech/voc institution was, on December 31, 2016, accredited for four years or more. The NMS III scholarship will last until the tax benefit established in the Transformation Law for tech/voc institutions ends.. We cannot predict the effect that these or other student financing reforms may have on our operations in Chile. Any material limitations on the access of our students in Chile to government-sponsored financing may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Similar limitations on government-sponsored student financing in other countries in which we operate could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. We are subject to investigations by Chilean regulators, which could individually or in the aggregate, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. In December 2014, the Chilean Congress approved legislation that provides for the appointment of a provisional administrator or closing administrator to handle the affairs of failing universities or universities found to have breached their bylaws (the \"Provisional Administrator Law\"). If the Ministry of Education were to determine that one of the universities in Chile that is part of the Laureate International Universities network had violated its bylaws, it could appoint a provisional administrator for that university causing us to lose our rights to control that institution, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.. In December 2016, Servicio de Impuestos Internos Chile (\"SII\") notified separately UDLA Chile and UNAB that as part of the general audit program called \"Auditoría Integral a Universidades,\" it was requesting supporting documentation from them for the tax periods between November 2013 and October 2016. Each institution will submit responsive documents that support taxes paid related to its revenues and expenses, including to the extent such revenues and expenses involve financial dealings with Laureate for-profit entities.. In June 2016, the Ministry of Education notified UNAB that it was opening an investigation into possible violations of the not-for-profit nature of UNAB. In September 2016, the Ministry of Education notified UVM Chile that it was opening a similar investigation of UVM Chile. Each of the institutions. 67.

Each investigation is being conducted by an investigator appointed by the Ministry of Education under the Provisional Administrator Law. Under the Provisional Administrator Law, at the end of the investigation the Ministry of Education can either close the investigation or issue a report imposing one of the following measures: (i) ordering a recovery plan for the investigated institution, should the Ministry verify severe breaches of the institution's financial, administrative, labor or academic commitments; (ii) with the prior consent of the National Education Council, naming a provisional administrator for the institution if the Ministry determines that (a) there are serious risks to the administrative or financial viability of the institution that may affect the continuity of its educational programs, (b) there are serious and recurring breaches of the academic commitments of the institution to its students due to a lack of educational or teaching resources available to grant professional or technical degrees, (c) it is impossible for the institution to maintain its academic functions due to sanctions, injunctions or foreclosures affecting the institution, its campuses or its assets, (d) the institution is declared bankrupt or (e) a recovery plan pursuant to (i) above has not been presented, has been rejected or has been breached by the institution; or (iii) initiating a process to revoke the institution's license, in which case it would name a closing administrator.. While we believe that all of our institutions in Chile are operating in full compliance with Chilean law, we cannot predict what outcome may result from any investigations undertaken by the Ministry of Education or the SII. Depending upon the outcome of any investigation by the Chilean authorities, there could be a material adverse effect on our business. Any disruption to our operations in Chile would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. Our right to receive economic benefits from certain of the institutions that are organized as not-for-profit or non-stock entities, and that we account for as variable interest entities, may be limited.. We have obtained board and operating control and controlling financial interests in entities outside the United States that are educational institutions similar to U.S. not-for-profit, non-stock universities. Under applicable law, these institutions do not have recognized \"owners\" or shareholders, and generally cannot declare dividends or distribute their net assets to us. For accounting purposes, we have determined that these institutions are variable interest entities under GAAP and that we are the primary beneficiary of these variable interest entities. Maintenance of our interest in the variable interest entity institutions, and our ability to receive economic benefits from these entities, is based on a combination of (1) service agreements that other Laureate entities have with the VIE institutions, allowing the institutions to access the benefits of the  Laureate International Universities network and allowing us to recognize economies of scale throughout the network, (2) our ability to provide these entities with opportunities to invest for market returns in education-related real estate entities globally and (3) our ability to transfer our rights to govern the VIE institutions, or the entities that possess those rights, to other parties, which would yield a return if and when these rights are transferred. In limited circumstances, we may have rights to the residual assets in liquidation. Under the mutually agreed service agreements, we are paid at market rates for providing services to institutions such as access to content, support with curriculum design, professional development, student exchange, access to dual degree programs, affiliation and access to the Laureate International Universities network, and management, legal, tax, finance, accounting, treasury, use of real estate and other services. While we believe these arrangements conform to applicable law, the VIE institutions are subject to regulation by various agencies based on the requirements of local jurisdictions. These agencies, as well as local legislative bodies, review and update laws and regulations as they deem necessary or appropriate. We cannot predict the form of any laws that may be enacted, or regulations that ultimately may be adopted in the future, or what effects they might have on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If local laws or regulations were to change, the VIE institutions were found to be in violation of existing local laws or regulations, or regulators were to question the financial sustainability of the VIE. 68. Table of Contents. institutions and/or whether the contractual arrangements were at fair value, local government agencies could, among other actions:. <U+0095> revoke the business licenses and/or accreditations of the VIE institutions;    <U+0095> void or restrict related party transactions, such as the contractual arrangements between us and the VIE institutions;     <U+0095> impose fines that significantly impact business performance or other requirements with which the VIE institutions may not be able to comply;     <U+0095> require us to change the governance structures of the VIE institutions, such that we would no longer maintain control of the VIE institutions; or    <U+0095> disallow a transfer of our rights to govern the VIE institutions, or the entities that possess those rights, to a third party for consideration.. If we are unable to receive economic benefits from these institutions, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we are unable or limited in our ability to receive economic benefits from these institutions, we may be unable to consolidate the VIE institutions into our consolidated financial statements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including possible write-offs of all or a portion of our investment in the affected VIEs and a reduction in operating income, or we may be limited in our ability to recognize all of the institutions' earnings in our consolidated statements of operations.. For example, on January 24, 2018, the New Law was passed by the Chilean Congress and, assuming that it passes review by the Constitutional Court, it is expected to be signed into law by the President of Chile as early as the first quarter of 2018. Among other things, the New Law will prohibit for-profit organizations, such as Laureate, from controlling the boards of universities in Chile. The New Law also prohibits conflicts of interests and related party transactions with notable exceptions, including the provision of services that are educational in nature or essential for the university's purposes. The New Law provides for a transition period of one year for related party transactions and two years for control. The incoming Chilean presidential administration, which took office on March 11, 2018, will have the responsibility to both interpret the legislative mandates and implement new compliance processes.. The Company is currently reviewing the impact the New Law will have on its Chilean operations, including the extent to which it will affect existing contractual relationships that the Company maintains with its Chilean non-profit universities. As a result of the New Law, the Company currently expects that it will be required to deconsolidate its three Chilean non-profit universities, which are accounted for as variable interest entities, and its Chilean real estate subsidiary, although the Company expects it will retain an approximately 30% equity ownership interest in the real estate subsidiary. The deconsolidation could happen as early as the first quarter of 2018. The Company currently expects that the deconsolidation will result in a one-time write-off of the carrying value of the assets of between approximately $600 million and $850 million and a decrease of between approximately $410 million to $430 million in revenues on an annualized basis. In addition, on an annualized basis, the Company expects a decrease in operating income of approximately $35 million and a decrease in depreciation and amortization of approximately $35 million.. The Company's continuing evaluation of the impact of the New Law may result in changes to its expectations due to changes in the Company's interpretations of the law, assumptions used, and additional guidance that may be issued. There is no assurance that the New Law will not have additional material adverse effects on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company. See \" - Political and regulatory developments in Chile have materially adversely affected us and may continue to affect us.\" See also \" - Political and regulatory developments in Turkey may materially adversely affect us.\". 69. Table of Contents. Our ability to control our institutions may be materially adversely affected by changes in laws affecting higher education in certain countries in which we operate.. Our institutions are governed by the higher education laws of the various countries in which we operate, which may be amended or interpreted in ways that affect our ability to maintain control over the institutions through our ability to appoint the members of the institutions' governing bodies. If we are unable to maintain our rights of control of appointments to those governing bodies, our ability to realize economic benefits from these institutions may be severely limited, including not being able to transfer control of the institutions in a way that would yield us a return on our investment or not being able to implement or maintain service agreements with those institutions.. It is possible that the governance and control structures that we implement at a specific institution to comply with local laws and regulations would not allow us to meet the standards for consolidation of that institution's financial statements into our own consolidated financial statements. If we determine that we do not control an institution or otherwise meet the standards for consolidation, deconsolidation of that institution would be required. In that event, or if our controlling financial interest in that institution is impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. For example, in January 2018, the Chilean congress passed the New Law. See \" - Political and regulatory developments in Chile have materially adversely affected us and may continue to affect us.\". Our business may be materially adversely affected by a general economic slowdown or recession.. Many countries around the world have recently experienced reduced economic activity, increased unemployment, substantial uncertainty about their financial services markets and, in some cases, economic recession. These events may reduce the demand for our programs among students, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These adverse economic developments also may result in a reduction in the number of jobs available to our graduates and lower salaries being offered in connection with available employment which, in turn, may result in declines in our placement and retention rates. For example, in the United States, our professional-oriented graduate programs, such as master's degrees in teaching, are directly affected by the employment and promotion prospects for persons with advanced degrees. Efforts by states in recent years to reduce education funding by laying off younger teachers and curtailing pay increases for remaining teachers may have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain students in our graduate education programs. In addition, in 2017 we generated approximately 83% of our revenues outside the United States. As a result, any general economic slowdown or recession that disproportionately impacts the countries in which our institutions operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. The higher education market is very competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively.. Higher education markets around the world are highly fragmented and are very competitive and dynamic. Our institutions compete with traditional public and private colleges and universities and other proprietary institutions, including those that offer online professional-oriented programs. In each of the countries where we operate a private institution, our primary competitors are public and other private universities, some of which are larger, more widely known and have more established reputations than our institutions. Some of our competitors in both the public and private sectors may have greater financial and other resources than we have and have operated in their markets for many years. We also face potential competition from alternative education providers that prioritize open access education to students. A number of these providers have been formed recently to provide online curriculum from leading academics at little or no cost to the student. If this new modality is successful, it could disrupt the economics of the current education model (both for-profit and not-for-profit. 70. Table of Contents. institutions). Other competitors may include large, well-capitalized companies that may pursue a strategy similar to ours of acquiring or establishing for-profit institutions. Public institutions receive substantial government subsidies, and public and private not-for-profit institutions have access to government and foundation grants, tax-deductible contributions and other financial resources generally not available to for-profit institutions. Accordingly, public and private not-for-profit institutions may have instructional and support resources superior to those in the for-profit sector, and public institutions can offer substantially lower tuition prices or other advantages that we cannot match.. Any of these large, well-capitalized competitors may make it more difficult for us to acquire institutions as part of our strategy. They may also be able to charge lower tuitions or attract more students, which would adversely affect our growth and the profitability of our competing institutions. There is also an increased ability of traditional universities to offer online programs and we expect competition to increase as the online market matures. This may create greater pricing or operating pressure on us, which could have a material adverse effect on our institutions' enrollments, revenues and profit margins. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and may face competitive pressures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. If our graduates are unable to obtain professional licenses or certifications required for employment in their chosen fields of study, our reputation may suffer and we may face declining enrollments and revenues or be subject to student litigation.. Certain of our students require or desire professional licenses or certifications after graduation to obtain employment in their chosen fields. Their success in obtaining such licensure depends on several factors, including the individual merits of the student, whether the institution and the program were approved by the relevant government or by a professional association, whether the program from which the student graduated meets all governmental requirements and whether the institution is accredited. If one or more governmental authorities refuses to recognize our graduates for professional licensure in the future based on factors relating to us or our programs, the potential growth of our programs would be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we could be exposed to litigation that would force us to incur legal and other expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \"Item 3 - Legal Proceedings\" for more information. See also \" - Risks Relating to Our Highly Regulated Industry in the United States - The inability of our graduates to obtain licensure or other specialized outcomes in their chosen professional fields of study could reduce our enrollments and revenues, and potentially lead to litigation that could be costly to us.\". Our business may be materially adversely affected if we are not able to maintain or improve the content of our existing academic programs or to develop new programs on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner.. We continually seek to maintain and improve the content of our existing academic programs and develop new programs in order to meet changing market needs. Revisions to our existing academic programs and the development of new programs may not be accepted by existing or prospective students or employers in all instances. If we cannot respond effectively to market changes, our business may be materially adversely affected. Even if we are able to develop acceptable new programs, we may not be able to introduce these new programs as quickly as students or employers require or as quickly as our competitors are able to introduce competing programs. Our efforts to introduce a new academic program may be conditioned or delayed by requirements to obtain foreign, federal, state and accrediting agency approvals. The development of new programs and courses, both conventional and online, is subject to requirements and limitations imposed by the governmental regulatory bodies of the various countries in which our institutions are located, including the U.S. Department of Education (\"DOE\"), state licensing agencies and the relevant accrediting bodies. The imposition of restrictions on. 71. Table of Contents. the initiation of new educational programs by regulatory agencies may delay such expansion plans. If we do not respond adequately to changes in market requirements, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired and our financial results could suffer.. Establishing new academic programs or modifying existing academic programs also may require us to make investments in specialized personnel and capital expenditures, increase marketing efforts and reallocate resources away from other uses. We may have limited experience with the subject matter of new programs and may need to modify our systems and strategy. If we are unable to increase the number of students, offer new programs in a cost-effective manner or otherwise manage effectively the operations of newly established academic programs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.. Failure to keep pace with changing market needs and technology could harm our ability to attract students.. The success of our institutions depends to a significant extent on the willingness of prospective employers to hire our students upon graduation. Increasingly, employers demand that their employees possess appropriate technological skills and also appropriate \"soft\" skills, such as communication, critical thinking and teamwork skills. These skills can evolve rapidly in a changing economic and technological environment. Accordingly, it is important that our educational programs evolve in response to those economic and technological changes. The expansion of existing academic programs and the development of new programs may not be accepted by current or prospective students or by the employers of our graduates. Students and faculty increasingly rely on personal communication devices and expect that we will be able to adapt our information technology platforms and our educational delivery methods to support these devices and any new technologies that may develop. Even if our institutions are able to develop acceptable new programs and adapt to new technologies, our institutions may not be able to begin offering those new programs and technologies as quickly as required by prospective students and employers or as quickly as our competitors begin offering similar programs. If we are unable to adequately respond to changes in market requirements due to regulatory or financial constraints, unusually rapid technological changes or other factors, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired, the rates at which our graduates obtain jobs involving their fields of study could suffer and our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.. If students who avail themselves of government-sponsored student financing programs in certain countries do not graduate and subsequently default on their loans, we may be responsible for repaying a significant portion of their loans.. Our accredited Chilean institutions participate in a Chilean government-sponsored student financing program known as the CAE Program. The program was implemented by the Chilean government in 2006 to promote higher education in Chile for lower socio-economic level students with good academic standing. The CAE Program involves tuition financing and guarantees that are shared by our institutions and the government. As part of the program, our institutions provide guarantees resulting in contingent liabilities to third-party financing institutions, beginning at 90% of the tuition loans made directly to qualified students enrolled through the CAE Program and declining to 60%. The guarantees by our institutions are for the period in which the student is enrolled, and the guarantees are assumed entirely by the government upon the student's graduation. Additionally, when a student leaves one of our institutions and enrolls in another CAE-qualified institution, our institution will remain the guarantor of the tuition loans that have been granted to the student up to such date, and until the student's graduation from the new CAE-qualified institution. Assuming that all students at our institutions who are in the CAE Program, and all students who left our institutions and were part of the CAE Program, do not graduate, and that all of those students default on the full amount of the CAE-qualified loan balances, the maximum potential amount of payments our institutions could be required to make under the CAE Program was approximately $527 million at December 31, 2017. As. 72. Table of Contents. of December 31, 2017, we had recorded $27.1 million as estimated guarantee liabilities for these obligations. If a significant portion of our students who participate in the CAE Program were to default, the financial condition and results of operations of each participating institution would be materially adversely affected.. Similarly, students at substantially all of our Brazilian institutions are participating in a Brazilian government program known as FIES. FIES is a federal program established to provide financing to students enrolled in private institutions of higher education that meet certain academic standards and whose household incomes per capita are below a certain level. Under FIES, the government loans a portion of the tuition to eligible students, and then pays the corresponding loan amount to the higher education institution in special bonds, that the institution may use to pay its national social security tax and certain other federal taxes or, if the institution has a tax clearance certificate, that the institution can sell for cash in a public auction conducted by a government-sponsored bank.. FIES underwent a major reform at the end of 2017, consolidating several changes in the FIES statute (Law n. 10.260/2001), effective for new contracts in 2018. Contracts executed under the previous FIES regulations remain governed by the statutes in force at the time.. Under the new FIES regulation, in the case of a student's payment default on a FIES loan, the risk is borne by a new guarantee fund - called FG-FIES - which may have public contributions of up to BRL 3,000,000, and contributions from Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) that vary in range depending on the matriculation year of the student. The second financing offer - called P-FIES - has two variables and will be operated strictly by financial agents, who will also bear the risks of the operation. Since all variables are delinquency-related, HEI contributions to the fund may increase accordingly. Since there are no provisions for additional government contributions to the fund, extreme delinquency scenarios lead to a possible resources depletion.. For contracts still governed by the former FIES regulations, HEIs are responsible for repaying up to 15% of the related delinquency (30% if an institution has one or more open tax disputes that are not being defended in compliance with the applicable security/bond requirements). There is also a government-mandated, private guarantee fund (the \"FGEDUC\") that allows participating educational institutions to insure themselves for 90% (or 13.5% of 15%) of their losses related to student defaults under the FIES program.. In such cases, if a significant portion of our participating students were to default and their respective guarantors were to fail to fulfill the terms of their guarantee, or if the defaulting student was not required to provide a guarantor, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.. Regulatory changes that affect the timing of government-sponsored student aid payments or receipt of government-sponsored financial aid could materially adversely affect our liquidity.. New regulations may change the timing for the collection of government-sponsored student aid payments from our students. For example, in December 2014, regulators in Brazil announced several significant rule changes to FIES beginning in 2015; additional regulations were issued in December 2015. These changes raised the eligibility requirements, reduced the annual budget for the program and delayed payments to the post-secondary institutions that would otherwise have been due in 2015 and 2016. Such a delay in tuition payments from government-sponsored programs could negatively affect our liquidity and could require additional working capital or third-party funding to finance our operations. See \"Item 1 - Business - Industry Regulation - Brazil Regulation - Student Financing Program.\" See also \" - Risks Relating to our Highly Regulated Industry in the United States - The DOE may change our U.S. Institutions' method of receiving Title IV program funds, which could materially affect our liquidity.\". 73. Table of Contents. We may have exposure to greater-than-anticipated tax liabilities.. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.. Our future income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates. In addition, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations and accounting principles, could have a material adverse effect on our future income taxes.. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted comprehensive tax legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"2017 Tax Act\"), which significantly changed the manner in which the United States imposes income tax on multinational corporations. The 2017 Tax Act mandates complex computations not previously required by U.S. tax law. Accordingly, the application of accounting guidance for such items is currently uncertain. Further, compliance with the 2017 Tax Act and the accounting for such provisions require preparation and analysis of information not previously required or regularly produced. In addition, the U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law and impact our results of operations in future periods. Although we have provided a provisional estimate on the effect of the 2017 Tax Act in our consolidated financial statements (See Note 16, Income Taxes), further regulatory or GAAP accounting guidance relating to the 2017 Tax Act, our further analysis on the application of the law, and refinement of our initial estimates and calculations could materially change our current provisional estimates, which could in turn materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We have not recorded any deferred tax liabilities for undistributed foreign earnings either because of legal restrictions on distributions or because our historical strategy was to reinvest these earnings outside the United States. As circumstances change and if some or all of these undistributed foreign earnings are remitted to the United States, we may be required to recognize deferred tax liabilities on those amounts.. Additionally, in certain countries in which we operate, higher education institutions are either exempt from paying certain taxes, including income taxes, or pay taxes at significantly reduced rates. This includes certain of our higher education institutions that are organized as VIEs, similar to not-for-profit institutions in the United States. If we were to lose this favorable tax treatment, either because a VIE institution is converted into a for-profit shareholder-owned entity, or because of a change in local tax laws, our tax liabilities could increase materially.. We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. We are also subject to non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are under regular audit by tax authorities with respect to these non-income based taxes and may have exposure to additional non-income based tax liabilities. Our acquisition activities have increased the volume and complexity of laws and regulations that we are subject to and with which we must comply.. We have identified certain contingencies, primarily tax-related, that we have assessed as being reasonably possible of loss, but not probable of loss, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations if the outcomes are unfavorable. In most cases, we have received indemnifications from the former owners and/or noncontrolling interest holders of the acquired businesses for contingencies. In cases where we are not indemnified, the unrecorded contingencies are primarily in Brazil and, in the. 74. Table of Contents. aggregate, we estimate that the reasonably possible loss for these unrecorded contingencies in Brazil could be up to approximately $55 million if the outcomes were unfavorable in all cases. If we are not able to recover amounts that are subject to indemnification, the loss for these contingencies could be greater.. During 2010, we were notified by the Spanish Taxing Authorities (\"STA\") (in this case, by the Regional Inspection Office of the Special Madrid Tax Unit) that an audit of some of our Spanish subsidiaries was being initiated for 2006 and 2007. On June 29, 2012, the STA issued a final assessment to Iniciativas Culturales de España, S.L. (\"ICE\"), our Spanish holding company, for approximately EUR 11.1 million ($13.1 million at December 31, 2017), including interest, for those two years based on its rejection of the tax deductibility of financial expenses related to certain intercompany acquisitions and the application of the Spanish ETVE regime. On July 25, 2012, we filed a claim with the Regional Economic-Administrative Court challenging this assessment and, in the same month, we issued a cash-collateralized letter of credit for the assessment amount, in order to suspend the payment of the tax due. Further, in July 2013, we were notified by the STA (in this case, by the Central Inspection Office for Large Taxpayers) that an audit of ICE was also being initiated for 2008 through 2010. On October 19, 2015, the STA issued a final assessment to ICE for approximately EUR 17.2 million ($20.4 million at December 31, 2017), including interest, for those three years. We have appealed this assessment and, in order to suspend the payment of the tax assessment until the court decision, we issued a cash-collateralized letter of credit for the assessment amount plus interest and surcharges. We believe the assessments in this case are without merit and intend to defend vigorously against them. During the second quarter of 2016, we were notified by the STA that tax audits of the Spanish subsidiaries were also being initiated for 2011 and 2012, and in July 2017 the tax audit was extended to include 2013; no assessments have yet been issued for these years. Also during the second quarter of 2016, the Regional Administrative Court issued a decision against the Company on its appeal. The Company has further appealed at the Highest Administrative Court level, which appeal has been rejected. The Company has appealed both decisions to the National Court. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company made payments to the STA totaling EUR 29.6 million (approximately US $35.1 million at December 31, 2017) in order to reduce the amount of future interest that could be incurred as the appeals process continues. The payments were made using cash that collateralized the letters of credit discussed above.. During the quarter ended June 30, 2015, we reassessed our position regarding the ICE tax audit matters as a result of recent adverse decisions from the Spanish Supreme Court and Spanish National Court on cases for taxpayers with similar facts, and determined that we could no longer support a more-likely-than-not position. As a result, during the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a provision totaling EUR 37.6 million ($42.1 million) for the period from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2016. We plan to continue the appeals process for the periods already audited and assessed.. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially adversely affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.. Our reported revenues and earnings may be negatively affected by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and currency exchange rates.. We report revenues, costs and earnings in U.S. dollars, while our institutions generally collect tuition in the local currency. Exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the local currency in the countries where we operate institutions are likely to fluctuate from period to period. In 2017, approximately 83% of our revenues originated outside the United States. We translate revenues and other results denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars for our consolidated financial statements. This translation is based on average exchange rates during a reporting period. In recent years, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against many international currencies, including the Brazilian. 75. Table of Contents. real, euro and Mexican peso. As the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar strengthens, our reported international revenues and earnings are reduced because foreign currencies translate into fewer U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2017, a hypothetical 10% adverse change in average annual foreign currency exchange rates, excluding the impacts of our derivatives, would have decreased our operating income and our Adjusted EBITDA by $28.6 million and $80.2 million, respectively. For more information, see \"Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Risk.\". To the extent that foreign revenues and expense transactions are not denominated in the local currency and/or to the extent foreign earnings are reinvested in a currency other than their functional currency, we are also subject to the risk of transaction losses. We occasionally enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other hedging arrangements to reduce the earnings impact of non-functional currency denominated non-trade receivables and debt and to protect the U.S. dollar value of our assets and future cash flows with respect to exchange rate fluctuations. Given the volatility of exchange rates, there is no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage currency transaction and/or translation risks. Therefore, volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. Currency exchange rates and our reported revenues and earnings may also be negatively affected by inflation or hyperinflation. If a country in which we operate is designated as a highly inflationary economy in the future under GAAP, the U.S. dollar would become the functional currency for our operations in that country. As a result, all gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of the financial results of operations in such country and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses would be reflected in our earnings, which could result in volatility within our earnings, rather than as a component of our comprehensive income within stockholders' equity. Hyperinflation in any of the countries in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles make up a significant portion of our total assets, and if we determine that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles become impaired in the future, net income and operating income in such years may be materially and adversely affected.. As of December 31, 2017, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $3,286.2 million. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Due to the revaluation of our assets at the time of the LBO and acquisitions we have completed historically, goodwill makes up a significant portion of our total assets. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the results of operations. Our review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles at December 31, 2017 resulted in an aggregate reduction of $8.5 million in the value of such assets in our financial statements. Future reviews of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles could result in reductions. Any reduction in net income and operating income resulting from the write down or impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles could adversely affect our financial results. If economic or industry conditions deteriorate or if market valuations decline, including with respect to our Class A common stock, we may be required to impair goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles in future periods.. We experience seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations.. Most of the institutions in our network have a summer break, during which classes are generally not in session and minimal revenues are recognized. In addition to the timing of summer breaks, holidays such as Easter also have an impact on our academic calendar. Operating expenses, however, do not fully correlate to the enrollment and revenue cycles, as the institutions continue to incur. 76. Table of Contents. expenses during summer breaks. Given the geographic diversity of our institutions and differences in timing of summer breaks, our second and fourth quarters are stronger revenue quarters as the majority of our institutions are in session for most of these respective quarters. Our first and third fiscal quarters are weaker revenue quarters because the majority of our institutions have summer breaks for some portion of one of these two quarters. Because a significant portion of our expenses do not vary proportionately with the fluctuations in our revenues, our results in a particular fiscal quarter may not indicate accurately the results we will achieve in a subsequent quarter or for the full fiscal year.. Connectivity constraints or technology system disruptions to our computer networks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain students.. We run the online operations of our institutions on different platforms, which are in various stages of development. The performance and reliability of these online operations are critical to the reputation of our institutions and our ability to attract and retain students. Any computer system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in traffic on our institutions' computer networks may result in the unavailability of these computer networks. In addition, any significant failure of our computer networks could disrupt our on-campus operations. Individual, sustained or repeated occurrences could significantly damage the reputation of our institutions' operations and result in a loss of potential or existing students. Additionally, the computer systems and operations of our institutions are vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters and other catastrophic events and network and telecommunications failures. The disaster recovery plans and backup systems that we have in place may not be effective in addressing a natural disaster or catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology and infrastructure systems. As a result of any of these events, we may not be able to conduct normal business operations and may be required to incur significant expenses in order to resume normal business operations. As a result, our revenues and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.. We rely on computer systems for financial reporting and other operations and any disruptions in our systems would materially adversely affect us.. We rely on computer systems to support our financial reporting capabilities, including our SSOs, and other operations. As with any computer systems, unforeseen issues may arise that could affect our ability to receive adequate, accurate and timely financial information, which in turn could inhibit effective and timely decisions. Furthermore, it is possible that our information systems could experience a complete or partial shutdown. If such a shutdown occurred, it could materially adversely affect our ability to report our financial results in a timely manner or to otherwise operate our business.. We are subject to privacy and information security laws and regulations due to our collection and use of personal information, and any violations of those laws or regulations, or any breach, theft or loss of that information, could materially adversely affect our reputation and operations.. Possession and use of personal information in our operations subjects us to risks and costs that could harm our business. Our institutions collect, use and retain large amounts of personal information regarding our students and their families, including social security numbers, tax return information, personal and family financial data and credit card numbers. We also collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business. In addition, we collect and maintain other types of information, such as leads, that may include personal information of our business contacts in the ordinary course of our business. Our computer networks and the networks of certain of our vendors that hold and manage confidential information on our behalf may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, cyber-attacks and other security threats. Confidential information also may become available to third parties inadvertently when we integrate or. 77. Table of Contents. convert computer networks into our network following an acquisition of an institution or in connection with upgrades from time to time.. Due to the sensitive nature of the information contained on our networks, such as students' grades, our networks may be targeted by hackers. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Although we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information, a third party may be able to circumvent those security and business controls, which could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. In addition, errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. Possession and use of personal information in our operations also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could require notification of data breaches and restrict our use of personal information. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches. A wide range of high profile data breaches in recent years has led to renewed interested in data and cybersecurity legislation that could materially increase our costs and/or require changes in our operating procedures or systems. Any breach of student or employee privacy or errors in storing, using or transmitting personal information could violate the privacy laws and regulations of one or more of the countries in which we operate, resulting in fines or other penalties. A breach, theft or loss of personal information regarding our students and their families, our employees, or other persons that is held by us or our vendors, or a violation of the laws and regulations governing privacy in one or more of the countries in which we operate, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or result in lawsuits, additional regulation, remediation and compliance costs or investments in additional security systems or networks, the costs of which may be substantial.. We may lose the right to license certain intellectual property which is integral to our online course offerings.. With our mandate that all of our institutions offer a certain percentage of online course offerings, we rely heavily upon the licensing of third-party materials, including e-textbooks and graphic, video and audio media, which are incorporated into our globally offered course content. Our institutions contract with large vendors which offer volumes of such course content. We could lose the right to license some percentage or all of those third-party materials for several reasons, including our licensors' infringement of third-party materials, going out of business, or terminating our content licenses for one or more business reasons. We rely on the negotiation of extensive licensing rights to mitigate this eventuality and contract with known, reliable vendors. If we lose the right to a significant percentage of such content, our course offerings and programs could be negatively affected because those materials must be removed from our course offerings, resulting in significant cost to us to revise the affected courses and a poor educational experience for our students, which could negatively affect our reputation, and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.. 78. Table of Contents. We may infringe the intellectual property rights of one or more of our third-party licensors.. All of our institutions offer a certain percentage of online course offerings. The educational content contained in such online course offerings is inherently more susceptible to infringement than campus-based learning materials because it is easier to make many digital copies of an online text, picture, video or audio file than it is to reproduce hard-copy materials. Also, intellectual property laws can vary from country to country, resulting in additional risk of infringement when licensing the same materials in multiple countries. Our institutions take reasonable precautions to ensure that all course content offerings used by them are properly licensed and distributed; however, there is no assurance that all of our course content offerings are properly licensed. Additionally, we create universally applicable course and program offerings that are licensed throughout our institutions, meaning that a single act of infringement could adversely affect multiple institutions around the world. Intellectual property infringement by us and our institutions can result in damaged vendor relationships, legal proceedings, loss of course content, and reputational loss, which could negatively affect our reputation, and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.. We may be unable to bring the Laureate brand into new markets due to preexisting trademark owners.. We file for and seek trademark protection for at least one of the Laureate brands, including \"Laureate,\" \"Laureate Education, Inc.,\" \"Laureate Online Education,\" \"Laureate Online International,\" and \"Laureate International Universities\" in all jurisdictions in which we operate. Our business model includes expanding into new markets through the creation and/or acquisition of new institutions in new or existing countries. Preexisting trademark owners already could have rights to some variant of the Laureate trademark in the education industry in certain new countries and this may prevent Laureate from introducing its brand to these markets. This could prevent Laureate from achieving a comprehensively global educational brand.. Our trademarks are subject to infringement.. As a global education services brand, our trademarks are subject to infringement by third parties attempting to trade on the Laureate brand's goodwill. We have spent considerable time and resources over the years in defending our trademark rights in the United States and abroad. It is difficult to assess the cost and likelihood of success in any legal proceeding related to trademark infringement, but we have implemented a policy of obtaining trademark rights for all of our brands in all countries in which we operate or plan to operate now and in the future and defending those rights vigorously. For example, in 2014, we filed a trademark infringement suit against an alleged infringer of the Laureate trademark located in the state of Georgia. The alleged infringer has formed several companies which incorporate the name \"Laureate\" and which purport to operate in the field of educational services. Although we won the case, the defendant has appealed. To date, the alleged infringer has not presented evidence that its use predates our use of the trademark \"Laureate\" in the field of educational services. An unfavorable result in a trademark infringement case such as this could lead to us being barred from using our trademark in certain jurisdictions around the world and negatively affect our reputation.. Student protests and strikes may disrupt our ability to hold classes as well as our ability to attract and retain students, which could materially adversely affect our operations.. Political, social and economic developments in the countries in which we operate may cause protests and disturbances against conditions in those countries, including policies relating to the operation and funding of higher education institutions. These disturbances may involve protests on university campuses, including the occupation of university buildings and the disruption of classes. We are unable to predict whether students at institutions in the Laureate International Universities network will engage in various forms of protest in the future. Should we sustain student strikes, protests or. 79. Table of Contents. occupations in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and on our overall financial condition. Further, we may need to make additional investments in security infrastructure and personnel on our campuses in order to prevent future student protests from disrupting the ability of our institutions to hold classes. If we are required to make substantial additional investments in security, or if we are unable to identify security enhancements that would prevent future disruptions of classes, that could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may need to pay overtime compensation to certain of our faculty and staff, which may increase our overall costs.. We may be unable to operate one or more of our institutions or suffer liability or loss due to a natural or other disaster.. Our institutions are vulnerable to natural or other disasters, including fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes and other events beyond our control. A number of our institutions are located in areas such as Mexico and Central America that are prone to hurricane damage, which may be substantial. A number of our institutions are also located in areas, such as Chile, Mexico, Peru and Turkey, that are prone to earthquake damage. For example, in 2017, Peru's normally arid regions experienced historic, torrential rainfall and subsequent flooding. At least one of our campuses located there suffered flood-related damage. There, as elsewhere in the country, flood-related damage caused a range of disruptions, including in our case a delay in the regularly scheduled start of classes for the semester, which caused revenue anticipated to occur in the first quarter of 2017 not to be recognized until the second quarter. On September 19, 2017, a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck Mexico causing a temporary suspension of activities at several UVM and UNITEC campuses located in the affected states of Mexico City, Puebla, Veracruz, Morelos, Chiapas and Estado de México. UVM and UNITEC temporarily suspended all activities on 21 campuses at the request of the Ministry of Education. The temporary suspension lasted 12 days on average and we incurred direct costs for repairs due to the earthquake of approximately $3.3 million. It is possible that one or more of our institutions would be unable to operate for an extended period of time in the event of a hurricane, earthquake or other disaster which does substantial damage to the area in which an institution is located. The failure of one or more of our institutions to operate for a substantial period of time could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In the event of a major natural or other disaster, we could also experience loss of life of students, faculty members and administrative staff, or liability for damages or injuries.. If there is an outbreak of disease in one or more of our locations, our ability to recruit new students or hold classes may be interrupted.. In recent years, there have been numerous outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as Zika, SARS and the H1N1 virus, that have spread quickly through populations in countries in which we operate, and have had serious impact on businesses that operate in those countries. Concentrated populations, such as students in upper secondary schools and universities, may be particularly susceptible to these diseases, requiring local governments to take various measures, including suspension of business and quarantines, to control their spread. If there is an outbreak of disease in a country in which we operate, our recruiters may be prevented from visiting local upper secondary schools during the student recruitment season, which could have a material adverse effect on our new student enrollments during the following academic term. In addition, an outbreak during the academic year could result in a shutdown of one or more campuses, or a quarantine that could prevent students and faculty from entering a campus or, in the case of a residential campus, a quarantine of students on campus without faculty access, resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.. 80. Table of Contents. We may be unable to recruit, train and retain qualified and experienced faculty and administrative staff at our institutions.. Our success and ability to grow depend on the ability to hire and retain large numbers of talented people. The process of hiring employees with the combination of skills and attributes required to implement our business strategy can be difficult and time-consuming. Our faculty members in particular are key to the success of our institutions. Our rapid global expansion has presented challenges for recruiting talented people with the right experience and skills for our needs. We face competition in attracting and retaining faculty members who possess the necessary experience and accreditation to teach at our institutions. As we expand and add personnel, it may be difficult to maintain consistency in the quality of our faculty and administrative staff. If we are unable to, or are perceived to be unable to, attract and retain experienced and qualified faculty, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.. High crime levels in certain countries and regions in which we operate institutions may have an impact on our ability to attract and retain students and may increase our operating expenses.. Many of our institutions are located in countries and regions that have high rates of violent crime, drug trafficking and vandalism. If we are unable to maintain adequate security levels on our campuses, and to work with local authorities to maintain adequate security in the areas adjacent to our campuses, we may not be able to continue to attract and retain students, or we may have to close a campus either temporarily or permanently. For example, in 2014 we closed a small campus of one of our universities in Mexico because of threats from a local drug cartel. In addition, high crime rates may require us to make additional investments in security infrastructure and personnel, which may cause us to increase our tuition rates in order to maintain operating margins. Certain security measures may materially adversely affect the campus experience by making access by students more cumbersome, which may be viewed negatively by some of our existing or prospective students. If we are not able to attract and retain students because of our inability to provide them with a safe environment, or if we are required to make substantial additional investments in security, that could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. If we are unable to upgrade our campuses, they may become less attractive to parents and students and we may fail to grow our business.. All of our institutions require periodic upgrades to remain attractive to parents and students. Upgrading the facilities at our institutions could be difficult for a number of reasons, including the following:. <U+0095> our properties may not have the capacity or configuration to accommodate proposed renovations;    <U+0095> construction and other costs may be prohibitive;    <U+0095> we may fail to obtain regulatory approvals;    <U+0095> it may be difficult and expensive to comply with local building and fire codes, especially as to properties that we acquired as part of past acquisitions;    <U+0095> we may be unable to finance construction and other costs; and    <U+0095> we may not be able to negotiate reasonable terms with our landlords or developers or complete the work within acceptable timeframes.. Our failure to upgrade the facilities of our institutions could lead to lower enrollment and could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. 81. Table of Contents. Our planned growth will require occupying increasing amounts of real estate that can be difficult to obtain and are subject to local regulation and control by landlords.. In order to continue to expand, we must continue to buy or lease additional real estate and construct new campus buildings. Construction of new campus buildings requires us to obtain permits from local authorities and to manage complex construction projects, which may result in unanticipated delays or expenditures. In 2013, the opening of a new campus building at UNAB was delayed, resulting in the need to relocate students to temporary facilities while the building was completed. UNAB incurred expenses to rent temporary facilities and provided tuition discounts to those students affected by the delay. The real estate that institutions in the Laureate International Universities network occupy is subject to local regulations, some of which may affect their ability to expand their operations. For example, in some locations, institutions are required by local regulations to provide a specific number of parking spaces per student enrolled or per area constructed. Even if there were adequate space in the academic facilities to expand the number of programs offered or students enrolled, we may not be able to expand if we are not able to provide adequate parking at a reasonable cost. Approximately half of the real estate that institutions in the  Laureate International Universities network occupy is leased and may be subject to lease provisions that give the landlord the ability to affect the operation of the academic programs. For example, in certain jurisdictions, the landlord may be responsible for obtaining and maintaining occupancy permits or licenses, without which we cannot operate. If the landlord does not maintain the required permits or licenses, the institution may be required to suspend operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In Brazil, real estate laws provide that rent terms under certain types of leases are subject to periodic adjustments to reflect local economic conditions. These rent increases can be substantial, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We currently have leases with various expiration dates, some of which have renewal options. Our ability to renegotiate favorable terms on an expiring lease or to negotiate favorable terms for a suitable alternate location, and our ability to negotiate favorable lease terms for additional locations, will depend on conditions in the real estate market, competition for desirable properties and our relationships with current and prospective landlords or may depend on other factors that are not within our control. Any or all of these factors and conditions could negatively affect our growth.. We have recently experienced a significant transition at the executive management level. If our new executive team is unable to engage and align mid-management or attract and retain the key talent needed for us to timely achieve our business objectives, our business and results of operations could be harmed.. Effective January 1, 2018, our former President and Chief Administrative Officer, Eilif Serck-Hanssen, became Chief Executive Officer, and our former Chief Operating Officer, Ricardo Berckemeyer, assumed the additional title of President. Simultaneously, our Founder, Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, Douglas Becker, assumed the role of non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors.. During the 2017 fiscal year, we experienced additional changes in our senior management, including the following departures from the Company: Timothy Daniels, former CEO of our EMEAA segment; Jonathan Kaplan, former President/CEO of Walden University and CEO of Laureate Online; Alfonso Martinez, Chief Human Resources Officer; Richard Patro, CEO, Global Products and Services; Karl Salnoske, Chief Information Officer; and Robert Zentz, Senior Vice President, Secretary, General Counsel. We also added the following individuals: Jean-Jacques Charhon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Neel Broker, CEO of our EMEAA segment; Juan José Hurtado, Senior Vice President, Operations and Chief of Learning and Innovation; Jose Roberto Loureiro, CEO of our Brazil segment; and Victoria Silbey, Senior Vice President, Secretary, and Chief Legal Officer.. While the individual members of our executive management team each have significant industry-related experience, they previously have not worked together as a group and it will take time for them. 82. Table of Contents. to become an integrated management team. Delays in the integration of our management team could affect our ability to implement our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. In addition, the marketplace for senior executive management candidates is very competitive. Our growth may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain such key employees. Turnover of senior management can adversely affect our stock price, our results of operations and our client relationships, and can make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. Competition for senior leadership may increase our compensation expenses, which may negatively affect our profitability.. Our status as a Certified B Corporation may not result in the benefits that we anticipate.. While not required by Delaware law or the terms of our certificate of incorporation, we have elected to have our social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency assessed against the proprietary criteria established by an independent non-profit organization. As a result of this assessment, we have been designated as a \"Certified B CorporationTM,\" which refers to companies that are certified as meeting certain levels of social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency. The standards for Certified B Corporation certification are set by an independent organization and may change over time. See \"Item 1 - Business - Certified B Corporation.\" Our reputation could be harmed if we lose our status as a Certified B Corporation, whether by our choice or by our failure to continue to meet the certification requirements, if that failure or change were to create a perception that we are more focused on financial performance and are no longer as committed to the values shared by Certified B Corporations. Likewise, our reputation could be harmed if our publicly reported Certified B Corporation score declines.. The minority owners of our institutions may disagree with the way we operate the institutions or plan to expand the institutions, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.. Although we control all of our institutions, we share ownership or control of several of our institutions with minority stockholders. We currently do not have the right to buy out all of these minority interests. The minority owners could assert that our business decisions at the institution adversely affected the value of their investment. In certain of our institutions, minority owners continue to occupy key management positions and may have the ability to enter into agreements with third parties or take other actions that are inconsistent with our corporate policies, which could create legal burdens and additional expense for us. In addition, disagreements with the minority owners may distract management and may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Litigation may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, students, suppliers, competitors, minority partners, stockholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, regulatory actions and intellectual property claims, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately. 83. Table of Contents. found liable. As a result, litigation may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \"Item 3 - Legal Proceedings.\". We are subject to anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\"), as well as trade compliance and economic sanctions laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties, harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Doing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of numerous jurisdictions. These laws and regulations place restrictions on our operations and business practices. In particular, we are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage, along with various other anti-corruption laws. As a result of doing business in foreign countries and with foreign partners, we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees and other intermediaries comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws to which we are subject, there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the FCPA or other laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire. We cannot assure you that all of our local partners will comply with these laws, in which case we could be held liable for actions taken inside or outside of the United States, even though our partners may not be subject to these laws. Our continued international expansion, and any development of new partnerships and joint venture relationships worldwide, increase the risk of FCPA violations in the future.. Violations of anti-corruption laws, export control laws and regulations, and economic sanctions laws and regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. If we fail to comply with the FCPA or other laws governing the conduct of international operations, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws, export control laws and regulations, and economic sanctions laws and regulations by the United States or foreign authorities could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, regardless of the outcome of the investigation.. We may not generate anticipated savings from our EiP program or our SSOs.. In 2014, we launched EiP as an enterprise wide initiative to optimize and standardize our processes to enable sustained growth and margin expansion. The program, which we refer to as EiP Wave 1, was developed to enable vertical integration of procurement, information technology, finance, accounting, and human resources, thus enabling us to fully leverage the growing size and scope of our local operations while also enhancing our internal controls. This initiative is largely completed and has generated significant cost savings. The savings we have generated from this initiative, however, could be offset by many factors, including, among others, lack of acceptance by local regulators and institutions, inability to identify and hire qualified personnel to staff SSOs and unanticipated technical difficulties.. Following implementation of EiP Wave 1, we further evaluated additional opportunities for efficiencies and savings related to the mid-office functions (including, for example, student information systems and the enrollment-to-graduation cycle) as well as general and administrative structure and certain student-facing activities. We anticipate realizing $75 to $100 million of annual savings (generated primarily from general and administrative expense and technology-enabled efficiency solutions) by year end 2019. To achieve these savings, we expect to have approximately $125 million of. 84. Table of Contents. one-time costs associated with severance and restructuring expenses, as well as costs related to technology investments. Approximately 50% of these one-time costs were incurred in 2017; we anticipate that the remainder will be incurred in 2018 and 2019. There can be no assurance that we will achieve these savings goals or that we will not have to make additional investments in these programs to do so.. If we are not able to fully implement the EiP program and the SSOs successfully and timely and at the costs that we currently anticipate, or if these initiatives do not generate their intended operating efficiencies, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We are conducting an internal investigation of one of our network institutions for violations of the Company's policies, and possible violations of the FCPA and other applicable laws. A violation of these laws and regulations could subject us to penalties, harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. As previously disclosed, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded an operating expense of $18.0 million (the value of 40.0 million Turkish Liras at the date of donation) for a donation by our network institution in Turkey to a charitable foundation. We believed the donation was encouraged by the Turkish government to further a public project supported by the government and expected that it would enhance the position and ongoing operations of our institution in Turkey. The Company has learned that the charitable foundation which received the donation disbursed the funds at the direction of a former senior executive at our network institution in Turkey and other external individuals to a third party without our knowledge or approval.. In June 2016, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors initiated an internal investigation into this matter with the assistance of external counsel. The investigation concerns the facts surrounding the donation, violations of the Company's policies, and possible violations of the FCPA and other applicable laws in what appears to be a fraud perpetrated by the former senior executive at our network institution in Turkey and other external individuals. This includes an investigation to determine if the diversion was part of a scheme to misappropriate the funds and whether any portion of the funds was paid to government officials. As of the date of this Form 10-K, we have not identified that any other officers or employees outside of Turkey were involved in the diversion of the intended donation. Although we are pursuing efforts to recover the diverted funds, including through legal proceedings, there is no assurance that we will be successful. As a result of the investigation, we took steps to remove the former senior executive at our network institution in Turkey and he is no longer affiliated with that institution.. We have been advised by Turkish counsel that, under Turkish law, a Foundation University may not make payments that cause a decrease in the university's wealth or do not otherwise benefit the university. Given the uncertainty of recovery of the diverted donation and to mitigate any potential regulatory issues in Turkey relating to the donation, certain Laureate-owned entities that are members of the foundation that controls our network institution in Turkey have contributed an amount of approximately $13.0 million (the value of 40.0 million Turkish Liras on November 4, 2016, the date of contribution) to our network institution in Turkey to reimburse it for the donation.. In September 2016, we voluntarily disclosed the investigation to the U.S. Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). The Company is fully cooperating with these agencies in their investigations and inquiries relating to this matter. The Company has internal controls and compliance policies and procedures that are designed to prevent misconduct of this nature and support compliance with laws and best practices throughout its global operations. The Company is taking steps to enhance these internal controls and compliance policies and procedures. The governmental and Company investigations relating to these matters are ongoing,. 85. Table of Contents. and we cannot predict the outcome at this time, or the impact, if any, to the Company's consolidated financial statements or predict how the resulting consequences, if any, may impact our internal controls and compliance policies and procedures, business, ability or right to operate in Turkey, results of operations or financial position. If we are found to have violated the FCPA or other laws applicable to us, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.. See \" - We currently have four material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that, if not corrected, could result in material misstatements of our financial statements\" and \" - Our institutions are subject to uncertain and varying laws and regulations, and any changes to these laws or regulations or their application to us may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and result of operations.\". We currently have four material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that, if not corrected, could result in material misstatements of our financial statements.. In the course of preparing our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, we identified certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses related to (1) an inadequate contract management process, (2) inadequate accounting for tax matters, (3) inadequate knowledge of GAAP in the non-U.S. finance organization, (4) inadequate journal entry review processes and (5) inadequate controls over key reports and spreadsheets. We have remediated four of the five material weaknesses; however, as described below, the material weakness related to inadequate controls over key reports and spreadsheets remained at December 31, 2017.. As of December 31, 2017, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to inadequate controls over key reports and spreadsheets, as discussed above. Specifically, we did not design adequate controls to address the completeness and accuracy of key reports and spreadsheets. This material weakness (in combination with other prior material weaknesses discussed above, which have since been remediated) contributed to a revision to our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013. This material weakness could result in additional misstatements to accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.. As of December 31, 2016, we identified three additional material weaknesses which still exist as of December 31, 2017, as follows:. <U+0095> We identified a material weakness in our risk assessment process, which we determined was not operating adequately to identify and address the risks to our business and to establish appropriate control objectives given the environment in which we operate and the decentralized structure used to manage our operating activities. This material weakness in our risk assessment process was a factor contributing to two additional material weaknesses which we have further described below:   <U+0095> We identified a material weakness in that we did not appropriately assess the risks relating to our contracting processes and did not have controls that were properly designed or operating effectively to detect and prevent fraud (referred to as the Contract Legal Compliance material weakness). Specifically, our controls over contracting processes were not designed or operating effectively to incorporate appropriate levels of due diligence, requisite management approvals, segregation of duties or ongoing monitoring. This material weakness allowed for the occurrence of the incident in our network institution in Turkey as discussed in \"Item 1 - Business - Industry. 86. Table of Contents. Regulation - Turkish Regulation and Internal Investigation,\" as well as certain other contracting irregularities at other network institutions that also necessitated an internal investigation. This control deficiency could result in material misstatements of the accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.   <U+0095> We identified a material weakness in that we did not maintain effective controls over the operating effectiveness of information technology (\"IT\") general controls for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of our financial statements. Specifically we did not:    (i)maintain program change management controls to ensure that IT program and data changes affecting financial IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately;   (ii)maintain user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and that access to financial applications and data is adequately restricted to appropriate personnel; and   (iii)maintain computer operations controls to ensure that privileges are appropriately granted, and data backups are authorized and monitored.. These IT deficiencies did not result in a material misstatement to the financial statements, however, the deficiencies, when aggregated, could impact the effectiveness of IT-dependent controls (such as automated controls that address the risk of material misstatement to one or more assertions, along with the IT controls and underlying data that support the effectiveness of system-generated data and reports) that could result in misstatements potentially affecting all financial statement accounts and disclosures that would not be prevented or detected in a timely manner.. We have commenced the remediation of these material weaknesses and other deficiencies. Our efforts to remediate these material weaknesses may not be effective. If our efforts to remediate these material weaknesses are not successful, the remediated material weaknesses may reoccur, the current material weaknesses may not be remediated in a timely manner, or other material weaknesses could occur in the future.. As a result of these material weaknesses, we may be unable to report our financial results accurately on a timely basis, which could cause our reported financial results to be materially misstated and result in the loss of investor confidence or delisting of our Class A common stock and could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline. As a result of such failures, we could also become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our Class A common stock is listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, and become subject to litigation from investors, which could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations, and divert financial and management resources from our core business.. Further, if as a result of these material weaknesses we are unable to provide the DOE with required financial statements by specified deadlines, the DOE could take action to materially limit or terminate our U.S. Institutions' participation in the Title IV federal student aid programs, which could result in a material or adverse decline in revenues, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, the U.S. Institutions would then be unable to continue their business as currently conducted, which could be expected to have a material adverse effect on our U.S. Institutions' ability to continue as going concerns.. See \" - We are conducting an internal investigation of one of our network institutions for violations of the Company's policies, and possible violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable laws. A violation of these laws and regulations could subject us to penalties, harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\". 87. Table of Contents. We may in the future discover areas of our internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that need improvement. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, regardless of how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements, and we or our independent registered public accounting firm may conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to provide us with an unqualified opinion as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If that were to happen, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could lead to a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our Class A common stock is listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.. Additionally, the existence of any material weakness could require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weakness and management may not be able to remediate any such material weakness in a timely manner. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause the holders of our Class A common stock to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially adversely affect our business and share price.. Risks Relating to Our Highly Regulated Industry in the United States. Failure of any of our U.S. Institutions to comply with extensive regulatory requirements could result in significant monetary liabilities, fines and penalties, restrictions on our operations, limitations on our growth, or loss of access to federal student loans and grants for our students, on which we are substantially dependent.. Our U.S. Institutions are subject to extensive regulatory requirements, including at the federal, state, and accrediting agency levels. Many students at our U.S. Institutions rely on the availability of federal student financial aid programs, known as Title IV programs, which are administered by the DOE, to finance their cost of attending our institutions. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, Kendall College, NewSchool of Architecture and Design, St. Augustine and Walden University derived approximately 31%, 35%, 65% and 73%, respectively, of their revenues (calculated on a cash basis) from Title IV program funds. In the aggregate, our U.S. Institutions derived approximately $498 million of revenues (calculated on a cash basis) from Title IV programs during the year ended December 31, 2017.. 88. Table of Contents. To participate in Title IV programs, our U.S. Institutions must be authorized by the appropriate state education agency or agencies, be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the DOE, and be certified as an eligible institution by the DOE. As a result, our U.S. Institutions are subject to extensive regulation and review by these agencies and commissions which cover the vast majority of our U.S. operations, including our educational programs, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, student recruiting and admissions, and financial operations. These regulations also affect our ability to acquire or open additional institutions, add new educational programs, substantially change existing programs or change our corporate or ownership structure. The agencies and commissions that regulate our operations periodically revise their requirements and modify their interpretations of existing requirements. Regulatory requirements are not always precise and clear, and regulatory agencies may sometimes disagree with the way we interpret or apply these requirements. If we misinterpret or are found to have not complied with any of these regulatory requirements, our U.S. Institutions could suffer financial penalties, limitations on their operations, loss of accreditation, termination of or limitations on their ability to grant degrees and certificates, or limitations on or termination of their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we are charged with regulatory violations, our reputation could be damaged, which could have a negative impact on our enrollments and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict with certainty how all of these regulatory requirements will be applied, or whether we will be able to comply with all of the applicable requirements in the future.. If any of our U.S. Institutions were to lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, we would experience a material and adverse decline in revenues, financial condition, results of operations, and future growth prospects. Furthermore, the affected U.S. Institution would be unable to continue its business as it is currently conducted, which could have a material adverse effect on the institution's ability to continue as a going concern.. If any of the U.S. education regulatory agencies or commissions that regulate us do not approve or delay any required approvals of transactions involving a change of control, our ability to operate or participate in Title IV programs may be impaired.. If we or one of our U.S. Institutions experiences a change of ownership or control under the standards of the DOE, any applicable accrediting agency, any applicable state educational licensing agency, or any specialized accrediting agency, we must notify or seek approval of each such agency or commission. These agencies do not have uniform criteria for what constitutes a change of ownership or control. Transactions or events that typically constitute a change of ownership or control include significant acquisitions or dispositions of shares of the voting stock of an institution or its parent company, and significant changes in the composition of the board of directors of an institution or its parent company. The occurrence of some of these transactions or events may be beyond our control. Our failure to obtain, or a delay in receiving, approval of any change of control from the DOE or any applicable accrediting agency or state educational licensing agency, could impair our U.S. Institutions' ability to operate or participate in Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to obtain, or a delay in receiving, approval of any change of control from any state in which our U.S. Institutions are currently licensed or authorized, or from any applicable accrediting agency, could require us to suspend our activities in that state or suspend offering applicable programs until we receive the required approval, or could otherwise impair our operations.. Our failure to obtain any required approval of any transactions from the DOE, the institutional accrediting agencies, or the pertinent state educational agencies could result in one or more of our U.S. Institutions losing continued eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs, accreditation or state. 89. Table of Contents. licensure, which could have a material adverse effect on our U.S. business, financial condition and results of operations.. Congress may revise the laws governing Title IV programs or reduce funding for those and other student financial assistance programs, and the DOE may revise its regulations administering Title IV programs, any of which could reduce our enrollment and revenues and increase costs of operations.. The U.S. Higher Education Act (the \"HEA\") is a federal law that governs Title IV programs. The U.S. Congress must authorize and appropriate funding for Title IV programs under the HEA and can change the laws governing Title IV programs at any time. The HEA was most recently reauthorized in August 2008. Congress is currently in the process of reauthorizing the HEA and has conducted hearings examining various issues including, but not limited to, the streamlining of Title IV financial aid programs and repayment systems, the role of consumer information in college choices by students and families, whether Title IV programs should include institutional risk sharing, and the role of accrediting agencies in ensuring institutional quality, among other items. On December 13, 2017, the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the U.S. House of Representatives approved legislation to reauthorize the HEA, titled the \"Promoting Real Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity through Education Reform Act\" (PROSPER Act). If enacted in its current form, this legislation would substantially amend the HEA, including but not limited to changes to Title IV programs and provisions governing institutional participation therein. We cannot predict the timing and terms of any eventual HEA reauthorization, including any potential changes to institutional participation or student eligibility requirements or funding levels for particular Title IV programs, which terms may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Apart from Title IV programs, eligible veterans and military personnel may receive educational benefits for the pursuit of higher education. A reduction in federal funding levels for Title IV programs, or for programs providing educational benefits to veterans and military personnel, could reduce the ability of some students to finance their education. We cannot predict with certainty the future funding levels for Title IV programs, or for programs providing educational benefits to veterans and military personnel, or the nature of any future revisions to the law or regulations related to these programs. Because a significant percentage of the revenues of our U.S. Institutions is and is expected to be derived from Title IV programs, any action by the U.S. Congress that significantly reduces Title IV program funding or the ability of our U.S. students to participate in Title IV programs could have a material adverse effect on our U.S. Institutions' enrollments, business, financial condition and results of operations. Congressional action also may require our U.S. Institutions to modify their practices in ways that could increase administrative costs and reduce profit margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. In recent years, the DOE has promulgated a substantial number of new regulations that impact our U.S. Institutions, including, but not limited to, state authorization, gainful employment, financial responsibility, borrower defenses to repayment, and the definition of a credit hour for the purpose of determining program eligibility for Title IV student financial aid. On October 30, 2014, the DOE published regulations to define \"gainful employment\" for the purposes of the Title IV program requirement that educational programs offered by proprietary institutions prepare students for gainful employment in recognized occupations, which became effective on July 1, 2015. On July 5, 2017, the DOE further announced that it would allow additional time, until July 1, 2018, for institutions to comply with certain disclosure requirements in the gainful employment regulations. On June 16, 2017, the DOE published a notice of intent to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed revisions to the gainful employment regulations. The DOE held negotiated rulemaking sessions on the gainful employment rule in December 2017 and February 2018, and will hold another negotiated rulemaking session in March 2018. If issued, any new gainful employment regulations would be effective July 1, 2019. We cannot predict with any certainty the outcome of the negotiated. 90. Table of Contents. rulemaking or the extent to which revised gainful employment regulations may differ from the current regulations.. On December 19, 2016, the DOE published final regulations regarding state authorization for programs offered through distance education and state authorization for foreign locations of institutions. Among other provisions, these final regulations require that an institution participating in the Title IV federal student aid programs and offering post-secondary education through distance education be authorized by each state in which the institution enrolls students, if such authorization is required by the state. The DOE would recognize authorization through participation in a state authorization reciprocity agreement, if the agreement does not prevent a state from enforcing its own laws. The final regulations also require that foreign additional locations and branch campuses be authorized by the appropriate foreign government agency and, if at least 50% of a program can be completed at the location/branch, be approved by the institution's accrediting agency and be reported to the state where the main campus is located. The final regulations would also require institutions to: document the state process for resolving complaints from students enrolled in programs offered through distance education or correspondence courses; and make certain public and individualized disclosures to enrolled and prospective students about their distance education programs. These final regulations are effective July 1, 2018.. The DOE may adopt regulations governing federal student loan debt forgiveness that could result in liability for amounts based on borrower defenses or affect the DOE's assessment of our institutional capability.. Under the DOE's current regulations, a William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (the \"Direct Loan Program\") borrower may assert as a defense to repayment any \"act or omission of the school attended by the student that would give rise to a cause of action against the school under applicable State law.\" On November 1, 2016, the DOE published a rule that, among other provisions, established new standards and processes for determining whether a Direct Loan Program borrower has a defense to repayment (\"DTR\") on a loan due to acts or omissions by the institution at which the loan was used by the borrower for educational expenses. The regulations were to take effect on July 1, 2017. On June 15, 2017, the DOE announced an indefinite delay to its implementation of the regulations, and on June 16, 2017 published a notice of intent to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed revisions to the rule.. Among other topics, the now-delayed rule established permissible borrower defense claims for discharge, procedural rules under which claims would be adjudicated, time limits for borrowers' claims, and guidelines for recoupment by the DOE of discharged loan amounts from institutions of higher education. It also prohibited schools from using any pre-dispute arbitration agreements, prohibited schools from prohibiting relief in the form of class actions by student borrowers, and invalidated clauses imposing requirements that students pursue an internal dispute resolution process before contacting authorities regarding concerns about an institution. For proprietary institutions, the now-delayed rule described the threshold for loan repayment rates that would require specific disclosures to current and prospective students and the applicable loan repayment rate methodology. The now-delayed rule also established important new financial responsibility and administrative capacity requirements for both not-for-profit and for-profit institutions participating in the Title IV programs. Under the now-delayed rule, certain events would automatically trigger a letter of credit, and the DOE retained discretion to impose a letter of credit upon the occurrence of other events.. The DOE held negotiated rulemaking sessions in November 2017, January 2018 and February 2018 regarding the DTR regulations. The DOE and negotiators failed to reach consensus on revised DTR regulations, and the DOE is now expected to issue revised DTR regulations for comment by the summer of 2018, with the rules becoming final by November 1, 2018. If issued, any new DTR regulations would be effective July 1, 2019. We cannot state with any certainly how the revised DTR regulations will differ from the now-delayed rule. Any new DTR regulations, whether or not they are. 91. Table of Contents. similar to the now-delayed regulations, could have a direct and substantial impact on our U.S. Institutions. In the meantime, regardless of the status of new DTR regulations, our U.S. Institutions are subject to student loan discharge liabilities. If we are required to repay the DOE for any successful DTR claims by students who attended our U.S. Institutions, or we are required to obtain additional letters of credit or increase our current letter of credit, it could materially affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. We cannot predict with any certainty the outcome of the litigation brought against the DOE, the extent to which a revised DTR rule may differ from the previously promulgated DTR regulations, or the impact that such a revised rule might have on our business.. Hearings and examinations of the for-profit educational industry could result in negative publicity, additional legislation, rulemaking by the DOE and other federal regulatory agencies, and other restrictions on our business.. The U.S. Congress and the Department of Defense (\"DoD\") have increased their focus in recent years on DoD tuition assistance that is used for distance education and programs at proprietary institutions. On multiple occasions since an April 2012 Executive Order, the DoD has revised its standard Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\") to include additional provisions applicable to all higher educational institutions providing educational programs through the DoD tuition assistance program. Our U.S. Institutions utilizing tuition assistance have signed DoD's standard MOU.. We cannot predict whether, or the extent to which, this scrutiny will result in legislation or further rulemaking affecting our participation in Title IV programs, or in programs providing educational benefits to veterans and military personnel. To the extent that any laws or regulations are adopted that limit our participation in Title IV programs, programs providing educational benefits to veterans and military personnel, or the amount of student financial aid for which the students at our U.S. Institutions are eligible, those institutions' enrollments, revenues and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.. Our U.S. Institutions must periodically seek recertification to participate in Title IV programs and, if the DOE does not recertify the institutions to continue participating in Title IV programs, our students would lose their access to Title IV program funds, or the institutions could be recertified but required to accept significant limitations as a condition of continued participation in Title IV programs.. DOE certification to participate in Title IV programs lasts a maximum of six years, and institutions are required to seek recertification from the DOE on a regular basis to continue their participation in Title IV programs. An institution must also apply for recertification by the DOE if it undergoes a change in control, as defined by DOE regulations, and may be subject to similar review if it expands its operations or educational programs in certain ways. Generally, the recertification process includes a review by the DOE of the institution's educational programs and locations, administrative capability, financial responsibility and other oversight categories. The DOE could limit, suspend or terminate an institution's participation in Title IV programs for violations of the HEA or Title IV regulations. As discussed in more detail under \"Item 1 - Business - Industry Regulation - U.S. Regulation,\" each of our U.S. Institutions currently participates in the Title IV programs pursuant to the DOE's provisional form of certification.. If the DOE does not renew or withdraws any of our U.S. Institutions' certifications to participate in Title IV programs at any time, students in the affected institution(s) would no longer be able to receive Title IV program funds. Similarly, the DOE could renew our U.S. Institutions' certifications, but restrict or delay Title IV funding, limit the number of students to whom it could disburse such funds or impose other restrictions. In addition, the DOE may take emergency action to suspend any of our U.S. Institutions' certifications without advance notice if it receives reliable information that an institution is violating Title IV requirements and it determines that immediate action is necessary to. 92. Table of Contents. prevent misuse of Title IV funds. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our U.S. Institutions' enrollments and our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our U.S. Institutions would lose their ability to participate in Title IV programs if they fail to maintain their institutional accreditation, and our student enrollments could decline if we fail to maintain any of our accreditations or approvals.. An institution must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the DOE to participate in Title IV programs. Each of our U.S. Institutions is so accredited, and such accreditation is subject to renewal or review periodically or when necessary. If any of our U.S. Institutions fails to satisfy any of its respective accrediting commissions' standards, that institution could lose its accreditation by its respective accrediting commission, which would cause the institution to lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and experience a significant decline in total student enrollments. In addition, many of our U.S. Institutions' individual educational programs are accredited by specialized accrediting commissions or approved by specialized state agencies. If any of our U.S. Institutions fails to satisfy the standards of any of those specialized accrediting commissions or state agencies, that institution could lose the specialized accreditation or approval for the affected programs, which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if an accrediting body of one of our U.S. Institutions loses recognition by the DOE, that institution could lose its ability to participate in Title IV programs.. If any of our U.S. Institutions fail to obtain or maintain any of its state authorizations in states where such authorization is required, that institution may not be able to operate or enroll students in that state, and may not be able to award Title IV program funds to students.. The DOE requires that an educational institution be authorized in each state where it physically operates in order to participate in Title IV programs. The level of regulatory oversight varies substantially from state to state. Our campus-based U.S. Institutions are authorized by applicable state educational licensing agencies to operate and to grant degrees or diplomas, which authorizations are required for students at these institutions to be eligible to receive funding under Title IV programs. If any of our U.S. Institutions fail to continuously satisfy applicable standards for maintaining its state authorization in a state in which that institution is physically located, that institution could lose its authorization from the applicable state educational agency to offer educational programs and could be forced to cease operations in that state. Such a loss of authorization would also cause that institution's location in the state to lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Many states also have sought to assert jurisdiction, whether through adoption of new laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, over out-of-state educational institutions offering online degree programs that have no physical location or other presence in the state but that have some activity in the state, such as enrolling or offering educational services to students who reside in the state, employing faculty who reside in the state or advertising to or recruiting prospective students in the state. State regulatory requirements for online education are inconsistent between states and not well developed in many jurisdictions. As such, these requirements change frequently and, in some instances, are not clear or are left to the discretion of state employees or agents. State regulatory agencies may sometimes disagree with the way we have interpreted or applied these requirements. Any misinterpretation by us of these regulatory requirements or adverse changes in regulations or interpretations of these regulations by state licensing agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our online educational programs offered by our U.S. Institutions and the constantly changing regulatory environment require us to continually evaluate our state regulatory compliance activities. We. 93. Table of Contents. review the licensure requirements of other states when appropriate to determine whether our activities in those states constitute a presence or otherwise require licensure or authorization by the respective state education agencies. Therefore, in addition to the states where we maintain physical facilities, we have obtained, or are in the process of obtaining, approvals or exemptions that we believe are necessary in connection with our activities that may constitute a presence in such other states requiring licensure or authorization by the state educational agency based on the laws, rules or regulations of that state. Some of our approvals are pending or are in the renewal process. Some of our U.S. Institutions do not have current approvals or exemptions from all of the state educational agencies that may require such an approval or exemption due to the U.S. Institution enrolling students via distance education in the state. If any of our U.S. Institutions fail to comply with state licensure or authorization requirements, we could be subject to various sanctions, including restrictions on recruiting students, providing educational programs and other activities in that state, and fines and penalties. Additionally, new laws, regulations or interpretations related to providing online educational programs and services could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students in particular states, which could, in turn, negatively affect enrollments and revenues and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. The failure to maintain any required state licensure or authorization for our distance education programs in the United States could prohibit us from recruiting prospective students or offering educational services to current students in one or more states, which could significantly reduce enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in the United States. Additionally, on December 19, 2016, the DOE published final regulations regarding state authorization for programs offered through distance education and state authorization for foreign locations of institutions. For additional information regarding these final regulations, see \" - Congress may revise the laws governing Title IV programs or reduce funding for those and other student financial assistance programs, and the DOE may revise its regulations administering Title IV programs, any of which could reduce our enrollment and revenues and increase costs of operations.\" Any failure to comply with state requirements, or any new or modified regulations at the federal or state level, could result in our inability to enroll students or receive Title IV funds for students in those states and could result in restrictions on our growth and enrollments.. Increased regulatory and enforcement effort aimed at proprietary education institutions could be a catalyst for legislative or regulatory restrictions, investigations, enforcement actions and claims that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. In recent years, the proprietary education industry has experienced broad-based, intensifying scrutiny in the form of increased investigations and enforcement actions. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \"FTC\") has issued civil investigative demands to several other U.S. proprietary educational institutions, which require the institutions to provide documents and information related to the advertising, marketing, or sale of secondary or postsecondary educational products or services, or educational accreditation products or services. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") has also initiated a series of investigations against other U.S. proprietary educational institutions alleging that certain institutions' lending practices violate various consumer finance laws. In addition, attorneys general in several states have become more active in enforcing consumer protection laws, especially related to recruiting practices and the financing of education at proprietary educational institutions.. In the event that any of our past or current business practices are found to violate applicable consumer protection laws, or if we are found to have made misrepresentations to our current or prospective students about our educational programs, we could be subject to monetary fines or penalties and possible limitations on the manner in which we conduct our business, which could. 94. Table of Contents. materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. To the extent that more states or government agencies commence investigations, act in concert, or direct their focus on our U.S. Institutions, the cost of responding to these inquiries and investigations could increase significantly, and the potential impact on our business would be substantially greater.. Our failure to comply with the laws and regulations of various states could result in actions that would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenues and results of operations.. We are subject to extensive laws and regulations by the states in which we are authorized or licensed to operate. State laws typically establish standards for instruction, qualifications of faculty, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations and other operational matters. State laws and regulations may limit our ability to offer educational programs and to award degrees and may limit the ability of our students to sit for certification exams in their chosen fields of study. In addition, as mentioned above, attorneys general in several states have become more active in enforcing consumer protection laws, and in some instances have partnered with the CFPB. In addition, we may be subject to litigation by private parties alleging that we violated state laws regarding the educational programs provided by our U.S. Institutions and their operations. For more information on these lawsuits, see \"Item 3 - Legal Proceedings.\". On September 8, 2016, as part of a program review that the Minnesota Office of Higher Education (\"MOHE\") is conducting of Walden University's doctoral programs, MOHE sent to Walden University an information request regarding its doctoral programs and complaints filed by doctoral students. We have been informed by MOHE that in an effort to better understand the context, background and issues related to doctoral student complaints in Minnesota, MOHE is initiating a full review of doctoral programs for certain institutions registered in Minnesota. MOHE has informed us that it expects to issue a report regarding its program review in 2018. We cannot predict the outcome of this matter. However, if MOHE makes an adverse determination, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. The inability of our graduates to obtain licensure or other specialized outcomes in their chosen professional fields of study could reduce our enrollments and revenues, and potentially lead to litigation that could be costly to us.. Certain of our graduates seek professional licensure or other specialized outcomes in their chosen fields following graduation. Their success in obtaining these outcomes depends on several factors, including the individual merits of the learner, but also may depend on whether the institution and the program were approved by the state or by a professional association, whether the program from which the learner graduated meets all state requirements and whether the institution is accredited. In addition, professional associations may refuse to certify specialized outcomes for our learners for similar reasons. The state requirements for licensure are subject to change, as are the professional certification standards, and we may not immediately become aware of changes that may impact our learners in certain instances. Also, as described below, the final gainful employment regulations require an institution to certify to the DOE that its educational programs subject to the gainful employment requirements, which include all programs offered by our U.S. Institutions, meet the applicable requirements for graduates to be professionally or occupationally certified in the state in which the institution is located. In the event that one or more states refuses to recognize our learners for professional licensure, and/or professional associations refuse to certify specialized outcomes for our learners, based on factors relating to our institution or programs, the potential growth of our programs would be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we could be exposed to litigation that would force us to incur legal and other expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. 95. Table of Contents. If any of our U.S. Institutions do not comply with the DOE's \"administrative capability\" standards, we could suffer financial penalties, be required to accept other limitations to continue participating in Title IV programs or lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.. DOE regulations specify extensive criteria an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite \"administrative capability\" to participate in Title IV programs. These criteria require, among other things, that we comply with all applicable Title IV program regulations; have capable and sufficient personnel to administer the federal student financial aid programs; not have student loan cohort default rates in excess of specified levels; have acceptable methods of defining and measuring the satisfactory academic progress of our students; have various procedures in place for safeguarding federal funds; not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension; provide financial aid counseling to our students; refer to the DOE's Office of Inspector General any credible information indicating that any applicant, student, employee or agent of the institution has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs; submit in a timely manner all reports and financial statements required by Title IV regulations; and not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability. If an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria or comply with any other DOE regulations, the DOE may change the institution's method of receiving Title IV program funds, which in some cases may result in a significant delay in the institution's receipt of those funds; place the institution on provisional certification status; or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate the participation of the institution in Title IV programs. Thus, if any of our U.S. Institutions were found not to have satisfied the DOE's \"administrative capability\" requirements, we could be limited in our access to, or lose, Title IV program funding, which could significantly reduce our enrollments and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. If any of our U.S. Institutions do not meet specific financial responsibility standards established by the DOE, that institution may be required to post a letter of credit or accept other limitations to continue participating in Title IV programs, or that institution could lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.. To participate in Title IV programs, our U.S. Institutions must satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by the DOE, or post a letter of credit in favor of the DOE and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in Title IV programs. These financial responsibility tests are applied on an annual basis based on an institution's audited financial statements, and may be applied at other times, such as if an institution undergoes a change in control. The DOE may also apply such measures of financial responsibility to an eligible institution's operating company and ownership entities and, if such measures are not satisfied by the operating company or ownership entities, require the institution to post a letter of credit in favor of the DOE and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in Title IV programs. The operating restrictions that may be placed on an institution that does not meet the quantitative standards of financial responsibility include changes to the method of receiving Title IV program funds, which in some cases may result in a significant delay in the institution's receipt of those funds. Limitations on, or termination of, our participation in Title IV programs as a result of our failure to demonstrate financial responsibility would limit our students' access to Title IV program funds, which could significantly reduce enrollments and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. As described in more detail under \"Item 1 - Business - Industry Regulation - U.S. Regulation,\" the DOE annually assesses our U.S. Institutions' financial responsibility through a composite score determination based on the Laureate consolidated audited financial statements and not at the individual institutional level. Based on Laureate's composite score for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the DOE determined that it, and consequently, Walden University, NewSchool of Architecture and Design, Kendall College and St. Augustine failed to meet the standards of financial. 96. Table of Contents. responsibility. As a result, in a letter dated October 30, 2017, the Department required Laureate to increase its existing letter of credit to $136,887,941 (15% of the Title IV program funds that the schools received during the most recently completed fiscal year), continued the institutions on Heightened Cash Monitoring 1 and required Laureate to continue to comply with additional notification and reporting requirements, including submitting bi-weekly cash flow statements for Laureate and monthly student rosters of the institutions. In a letter dated March 1, 2018, the DOE required Laureate to provide additional ongoing information about its current operations and future plans, including bi-weekly updates on its cash balances and monthly cash flow statements and student rosters for its U.S. Institutions, beginning in April 2018.. In December 2015, the DOE sent us a letter requiring us to post a letter of credit in the amount of $14,967 for St. Augustine (25% of the total Title IV program refunds the institution made or should have made during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014). This requirement was due to the fact that St. Augustine was found to have untimely processed refunds of Title IV program funds for withdrawn students for more than 5% of the students in its auditor's sample for the 2014 fiscal year. We have obtained this letter of credit. Any obligation to post, maintain or increase a letter of credit could materially adversely affect our liquidity or increase our costs of regulatory compliance. The DOE has the discretion to increase our letter of credit requirements at any time. If we are unable to secure any required letter of credit, our U.S. Institutions would lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. On November 1, 2016, as part of its defense to repayment rulemaking, the DOE issued a rule to revise its general standards of financial responsibility to include various actions and events that would require institutions to provide the DOE with irrevocable letters of credit upon the occurrence of certain triggering events. In June 2017, the DOE announced an indefinite delay in implementing these regulations and also announced its intent to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed revisions to these regulations. For additional information regarding this rule and current rulemaking, see \" - The DOE may adopt regulations governing federal student loan debt forgiveness that could result in liability for amounts based on borrower defenses or affect the DOE's assessment of our institutional capability.\" If we are required to repay the DOE for any successful DTR claims by students who attended our U.S. Institutions, or we are required to obtain additional letters of credit or increase our current letter of credit, it could materially affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.. The DOE may change our U.S. Institutions' method of receiving Title IV program funds, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity.. The DOE can impose sanctions for violating the statutory and regulatory requirements of Title IV programs, including transferring one or more of our U.S. Institutions from the advance method or the heightened cash monitoring level one method of Title IV payment, each of which permits an institution to receive Title IV funds before or concurrently with disbursing them to students, to the heightened cash monitoring level two method of payment or to the reimbursement method of payment, each of which may significantly delay an institution's receipt of Title IV funds until student eligibility has been verified by the DOE. Any such delay in our U.S. Institutions' receipt of Title IV program funds may materially adversely affect our cash flows and we may require additional working capital or third-party funding to finance our operations.. 97. Table of Contents. Our U.S. Institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if the percentage of our U.S. Institutions revenues derived from Title IV programs is too high.. A provision of the HEA commonly referred to as the \"90/10 Rule\" provides that a for-profit educational institution loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if, under a complex regulatory formula that requires cash basis accounting and other adjustments to the calculation of revenues, the institution derives more than 90% of its revenues from Title IV program funds for any two consecutive fiscal years. If any of our U.S. Institutions were to violate the 90/10 Rule, that institution would become ineligible to participate in Title IV programs as of the first day of the fiscal year following the second consecutive fiscal year in which the institution exceeded the 90% threshold and would be unable to regain eligibility for two fiscal years thereafter. In addition, an institution that derives more than 90% of its revenue (on a cash basis) from Title IV programs for any single fiscal year will be placed on provisional certification for at least two fiscal years and may be subject to additional conditions or sanctions imposed by the DOE. Using the DOE's formula under the \"90/10 Rule,\" Kendall College, NewSchool of Architecture and Design, St. Augustine and Walden University derived approximately 31%, 35%, 65% and 73% of their revenues (calculated on a cash basis), respectively, from Title IV program funds for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.. Our U.S. Institutions' ratios could increase in the future. Congressional increases in students' Title IV grant and loan limits may result in an increase in the revenues we receive from Title IV programs. In recent years, legislation has been introduced in Congress that would revise the 90/10 Rule to consider educational benefits for veterans and military personnel from the Department of Veteran Affairs and Department of Defense, respectively, in the same manner as Title IV funds for purposes of the rule, to prohibit institutions from participating in Title IV programs for one year if they derive more than 90% of their total revenues (calculated on a cash basis) from the Title IV programs and these other federal programs in a single fiscal year rather than the current rule of two consecutive fiscal years, and to revise the 90/10 Rule to an 85/15 rule. We cannot predict whether, or the extent to which, any of these proposed revisions could be enacted into law or result in further rulemaking. In addition, reductions in state appropriations in a number of areas, including with respect to the amount of financial assistance provided to post-secondary students, could further increase our U.S. Institutions' percentages of revenues derived from Title IV program funds. The employment circumstances of our students or their parents could also increase reliance on Title IV program funds. If any of our U.S. Institutions become ineligible to participate in Title IV programs as a result of noncompliance with the 90/10 Rule, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Any of our U.S. Institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if their respective student loan default rates are too high.. An educational institution may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if, for three consecutive years, 30% or more of its students who were required to begin repayment on their federal student loans in the relevant fiscal year default on their payment by the end of the next federal fiscal year. In addition, an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if the default rate as determined by the DOE of its students exceeds 40% for any single year. The Department of Education generally publishes official cohort default rates annually in September for the repayment period that ended the prior September 30.. Kendall College's official cohort default rates for the 2014, 2013 and 2012 federal fiscal years were 11.3%, 10.0% and 7.9%, respectively. NewSchool of Architecture and Design's official cohort default rates for the 2014, 2013 and 2012 federal fiscal years were 5.2%, 5.1% and 10.2%, respectively. St. Augustine's official cohort default rates for the 2014, 2013 and 2012 federal fiscal years were 0.0%, 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively. Walden University's official cohort default rates for the 2014, 2013 and 2012 federal fiscal years were 7.5%, 6.7% and 6.8%, respectively. The average national student loan. 98. Table of Contents. default rates published by the DOE for all institutions that participated in the federal student aid programs for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were 11.5%, 11.3% and 11.8%, respectively, and for all proprietary institutions that participated in the federal student aid programs for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were 15.5%, 15.0% and 15.8%, respectively.. While we believe our U.S. Institutions are not in danger of exceeding the regulatory default rate thresholds for other Title IV programs, we cannot provide any assurance that this will continue to be the case. Any increase in interest rates or reliance on \"self-pay\" students, as well as declines in income or job losses for our students, could contribute to higher default rates on student loans. Exceeding the student loan default rate thresholds and losing eligibility to participate in Title IV programs would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any future changes in the formula for calculating student loan default rates, economic conditions or other factors that cause our default rates to increase, could place our U.S. Institutions in danger of losing their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We could be subject to sanctions or other adverse legal actions if any of our U.S. Institutions were to pay impermissible commissions, bonuses or other incentive payments to individuals involved in or with responsibility for certain recruiting, admission or financial aid activities.. Under the HEA, an educational institution that participates in Title IV programs may not make any commission, bonus or other incentive payments to any persons or entities involved in recruitment or admissions activities or in the awarding of financial aid. The requirement only pertains to the recruitment of students who are U.S. citizens, permanent residents and others temporarily residing in the United States with the intention of becoming a citizen or permanent resident. Under regulations that took effect on July 1, 2011, the DOE effectively has taken the position that any commission, bonus or other incentive compensation payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, or securing enrollment or awarding financial aid is inconsistent with the statutory prohibition against incentive compensation. The DOE has maintained that institutions may make merit-based adjustments to employee compensation, provided that those adjustments are not based, in any part, directly or indirectly, upon securing enrollments or awarding financial aid. In sub-regulatory correspondence to institutions, the DOE provided additional guidance regarding the scope of the prohibition on incentive compensation and to what employees and types of activities the prohibition applies. Based on these regulatory changes, we modified some of our compensation practices, which could make it more difficult to attract and retain key employees and executives, and affect our ability to grow and maintain our business and enrollments.. In addition, in recent years, several for-profit education companies have been faced with whistleblower lawsuits under the Federal False Claims Act, known as \"qui tam\" cases, by current or former employees alleging violations of the prohibition against incentive compensation. If the DOE were to determine that we or any of our U.S. Institutions violated this requirement of Title IV programs, or if we were to be found liable in a False Claims action alleging a violation of this law, or if any third parties we have engaged were to violate this law, we could be fined or sanctioned by the DOE, or subjected to other monetary liability or penalties that could be substantial, including the possibility of treble damages under a False Claims action, any of which could harm our reputation, impose significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We could be subject to sanctions if any of our U.S. Institutions fails to correctly calculate and timely return Title IV program funds for students who withdraw before completing their educational program.. An institution participating in Title IV programs must calculate the amount of unearned Title IV program funds that it has disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational programs before. 99. Table of Contents. completing such programs and must return those unearned funds to the appropriate lender or the DOE in a timely manner, generally within 45 days of the date the institution determines that the student has withdrawn. If any of our U.S. Institutions does not properly calculate and timely return the unearned funds for a sufficient percentage of students, that institution may have to post a letter of credit in favor of the DOE equal to 25% of Title IV program funds that should have been returned for such students in the prior fiscal year. Additionally, if any of our U.S. Institutions does not correctly calculate and timely return unearned Title IV program funds, that institution may be liable for repayment of Title IV funds and related interest and may be fined, sanctioned, or otherwise subject to adverse actions by the DOE, including termination of that institution's participation in Title IV programs. Any of these adverse actions could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We could also be subject to fines or penalties related to findings cited in our regulatory compliance reviews. For more information, see \" - Government, regulatory agencies, accrediting bodies and third parties may conduct compliance reviews, bring claims or initiate litigation against us.\". We or certain of our educational programs at our U.S. Institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if any of our U.S. Institutions or certain of their educational programs cannot satisfy the DOE's \"gainful employment\" requirements.. Under the HEA, proprietary schools generally are eligible to participate in Title IV programs in respect of educational programs that lead to \"gainful employment in a recognized occupation.\" Historically, the concept of \"gainful employment\" has not been defined in detail. On October 30, 2014, the DOE published regulations to define \"gainful employment,\" which became effective on July 1, 2015. The regulations define this concept using two ratios, one based on annual debt-to-annual earnings (\"DTE\") and another based on annual debt-to-discretionary income (\"DTI\") ratio. Under the regulations, an educational program with a DTE ratio at or below 8% or a DTI ratio at or below 20% is considered \"passing.\" An educational program with a DTE ratio greater than 8% but less than or equal to 12% or a DTI ratio greater than 20% but less than or equal to 30% is considered to be \"in the zone.\" An educational program with a DTE ratio greater than 12% and a DTI ratio greater than 30% is considered \"failing.\" An educational program will cease to be eligible for students to receive Title IV program funds if its DTE and DTI ratios are failing in two out of any three consecutive award years or if both of those rates are failing or in the zone for four consecutive award years. The regulations also require an institution to provide warnings to current and prospective students in programs which may lose Title IV eligibility at the end of an award or fiscal year. For more information see \"Item 1 - Business - Industry Regulation - U.S. Regulation - Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs - Gainful Employment.\". In January 2017, the DOE issued final DTE rates to institutions. Among the Classification of Instructional Programs reported within NewSchool of Architecture and Design, Kendall College and Walden University, the DOE has indicated that we had one that failed and five in the zone. This represents a total of one educational program that failed and ten in the zone. St. Augustine had no programs that failed or were in the zone. The percentage of students enrolled in the educational program that failed represents approximately 1% of the students currently enrolled in our U.S. Institutions. The percentage of students enrolled in the educational programs that were in the zone represents approximately 5%. We are currently examining and implementing options for each of these programs and their students. We are discontinuing the program that failed. For one of the programs in the zone, we conducted an alternate salary survey and are appealing the zone score to the DOE. Additionally, the regulations require an institution to certify to the DOE that its educational programs subject to the gainful employment requirements, which include all programs offered by our U.S. Institutions, meet the applicable requirements for graduates to be professionally or occupationally licensed or certified in the state in which the institution is located. The regulations also include. 100. Table of Contents. requirements for the reporting of student and program data by institutions to the DOE and expand the disclosure requirements that have been in effect since July 1, 2011. On July 5, 2017, the DOE announced that it would allow additional time, until July 1, 2018, for institutions to comply with certain disclosure requirements in the gainful employment regulations.. On June 16, 2017 the DOE published a notice of intent to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed revisions to the gainful employment regulations. The DOE held negotiated rulemaking sessions on the gainful employment rule in December 2017 and February 2018, and will hold another negotiated rulemaking session in March 2018 nt. If issued, any revised gainful employment regulations would be effective July 1, 2019. We cannot predict with any certainty the outcome of the negotiated rulemaking or the extent to which revised gainful employment regulations may differ from the current regulations.. The failure of any program or programs offered by any of our U.S. Institutions to satisfy any gainful employment regulations could render that program or programs ineligible for Title IV program funds. Additionally, any gainful employment data released by the DOE about our U.S. Institutions or warnings provided under the regulations could influence current students not to continue their studies, discourage prospective students from enrolling in our programs or negatively impact our reputation. If a particular educational program ceased to become eligible for Title IV program funds, either because it fails to prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation or due to other factors, we may choose to cease offering the program. It is possible that several programs offered by our schools may be adversely affected by the regulations due to lack of specialized program accreditation or certification or in the states in which such institutions are based. We also could be required to make changes to certain programs in the future in order to comply with the rule or to avoid the uncertainty associated with such compliance. Any of these factors could reduce enrollments, impact tuition prices, and have a material adverse effect on our U.S. Institutions' business, financial condition and results of operations.. If we fail to maintain adequate systems and processes to detect and prevent fraudulent activity in student enrollment and financial aid, our business could be materially adversely affected.. Higher educational institutions are susceptible to an increased risk of fraudulent activity by outside parties with respect to student enrollment and student financial aid programs. The DOE's regulations require institutions that participate in Title IV programs to refer to the Office of Inspector General credible information indicating that any applicant, employee, third-party servicer or agent of the institution that acts in a capacity that involves administration of the Title IV programs has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs. We cannot be certain that our systems and processes will always be adequate in the face of increasingly sophisticated and ever-changing fraud schemes. The potential for outside parties to perpetrate fraud in connection with the award and disbursement of Title IV program funds, including as a result of identity theft, may be heightened due to our U.S. Institutions offering various educational programs via distance education. Any significant failure by one or more of our U.S. Institutions to adequately detect fraudulent activity related to student enrollment and financial aid could result in loss of accreditation at the discretion of the institutions' accrediting agency, which would result in the institution losing eligibility for Title IV programs, or in direct action by the DOE to limit or terminate the institution's Title IV program participation. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Any substantial misrepresentation regarding our U.S. Institutions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. The DOE's regulation regarding substantial misrepresentations includes statements about the nature of its educational programs, its financial charges or the employability of its graduates. Under the. 101. Table of Contents. regulation as promulgated by the DOE, any false, erroneous, or misleading statement, or statement that has the likelihood or tendency to deceive, that an institution, one of its representatives, or person or entity with whom the institution has an agreement to provide educational programs, marketing, advertising, recruiting or admissions services, makes directly or indirectly to a student, prospective student, any member of the public, an accrediting agency, a state licensing agency or the DOE could be deemed a misrepresentation by the institution. In the event that the DOE determines that an institution engaged in a substantial misrepresentation, it can revoke the institution's program participation agreement, impose limitations on the institution's participation in Title IV programs, deny participation applications on behalf of the institution, or seek to fine, suspend or terminate the institution's participation in Title IV programs. These regulations create broad grounds for the DOE to monitor and enforce violations of the regulations on substantial misrepresentation, and the DOE has recently taken actions to terminate the Title IV Program participation of, and impose significant financial penalties on other institutions based on its determination of such violations. These regulations also provide grounds for private litigants to seek to enforce the expanded regulations through False Claims Act litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. The requirement to notify the DOE in advance of introducing new programs, and to obtain approvals for new programs, could delay the introduction of such programs and negatively impact growth.. All of our U.S. Institutions are currently provisionally certified by the DOE and remain subject to certain program approval requirements otherwise applicable to provisionally certified institutions. Any delay in obtaining a required DOE approval could delay the introduction of the program, which could negatively impact our enrollment growth.. A bankruptcy filing by us, or by any of our subsidiaries that operate our U.S. Institutions or a closure of one of our U.S. Institutions or their affiliates, would lead to an immediate loss of the institution's eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.. In the event of a bankruptcy filing by us, or by any of our subsidiaries that operate our U.S. Institutions, the U.S. Institutions owned by us or the bankrupt subsidiary would lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, pursuant to statutory provisions of the HEA and notwithstanding the automatic stay provisions of federal bankruptcy law, which would make any reorganization difficult to implement. Additionally, in the event of any bankruptcy affecting one or more of our U.S. Institutions, the DOE could hold our other U.S. Institutions jointly liable for any Title IV program liabilities, whether asserted or unasserted at the time of such bankruptcy, of our U.S. Institutions whose Title IV program eligibility was terminated.. Further, in the event that an institution closes and fails to pay liabilities or other amounts owed to the DOE, the DOE can attribute the liabilities of that institution to other institutions under common ownership. If any one of our U.S. Institutions or affiliates were to close or have unpaid DOE liabilities, the DOE could seek to have those liabilities repaid by one of our other U.S. Institutions. In addition, the ultimate controlling owner of SFUAD is Wengen, which is also the ultimate controlling owner of Laureate. As a result, it is possible that the DOE could attempt to attribute any unpaid Title IV related liabilities of SFUAD to our other U.S. Institutions, or determine that our U.S. Institutions do not meet the DOE financial responsibility regulations, due to their common ownership. On April 12, 2017, SFUAD announced that it plans to close after the end of the 2017-2018 academic year and will work with its students on a phased teach-out and transfer process leading up to the graduation of students who are eligible to complete their degrees by May 2018 and appropriate transfer opportunities for other students.. 102. Table of Contents. Government, regulatory agencies, accrediting bodies and third parties may conduct compliance reviews, bring claims or initiate litigation against us.. Because we operate in a highly regulated industry, we may be subject to compliance reviews and claims of noncompliance and lawsuits by government agencies, regulatory agencies and third parties, including claims brought by third parties on behalf of the federal government. On September 21, 2015, the Higher Learning Commission notified Kendall College that the Higher Learning Commission placed the school on ongoing financial monitoring over the next 24 months. Such action was primarily due to concerns over the school's continued reliance upon Laureate to provide financial support to sustain its operations. See also \" - We could be subject to sanctions if any of our U.S. Institutions fails to correctly calculate and timely return Title IV program funds for students who withdraw before completing their educational program.\" The Higher Learning Commission also conducted an on-site mid-cycle review of Kendall on May 1, 2017. At its March 2018 meeting, the Institutional Actions Council of the Higher Learning Commission will consider the report for that mid-cycle review and Kendall's response. The Institutional Actions Council's recommendation will be considered by the Higher Learning Commission Board at its June 2018 meeting.. On September 8, 2016, as part of a program review that MOHE is conducting of Walden University's doctoral programs, MOHE sent to Walden University an information request regarding its doctoral programs and complaints filed by doctoral students. We have been informed by MOHE that in an effort to better understand the context, background and issues related to doctoral student complaints in Minnesota, MOHE is initiating a full review of doctoral programs for certain institutions registered in Minnesota. MOHE has informed us that it expects to issue a report regarding its program review in 2018.. The Higher Learning Commission conducted an on-site mid-cycle review of Walden University on May 1, 2017. The Higher Learning Commission determined that Walden University met the accreditation criteria, with the exception of two, for which it is requiring the school to submit follow-up reports. Specifically, Walden University must submit an interim report by May 2018 regarding its progress in addressing the \"material weakness\" (pertaining to Laureate's control over information technology systems) as identified by its auditors in its December 31, 2016 financial statements, and a second interim report by May 2019 regarding retention and graduation rate improvements to doctoral programs.. If the results of these or other reviews or proceedings are unfavorable to us, or if we are unable to defend successfully against lawsuits or claims, we may be required to pay money damages or be subject to fines, limitations, loss of eligibility for Title IV program funding at our U.S. Institutions, injunctions or other penalties. We may also lose or have limitations imposed on our accreditations, licensing or Title IV program participation, be required to pay monetary damages or be limited in our ability to open new institutions or add new program offerings. Even if we adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a lawsuit or claim, we may have to divert significant financial and management resources from our ongoing business operations to address issues raised by those reviews or to defend against those lawsuits or claims. Additionally, we may experience adverse collateral consequences, including declines in the number of students enrolling at our institutions and the willingness of third parties to deal with us or our institutions, as a result of any negative publicity associated with such reviews, claims or litigation. Claims and lawsuits brought against us may damage our reputation or cause us to incur expenses, even if such claims and lawsuits are without merit, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. 103. Table of Contents. Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness. The fact that we have substantial debt could materially adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and limit our ability to pursue our strategy or to react to changes in the economy or our industry.. We have substantial debt. As of December 31, 2017 we had outstanding: (a) a senior secured credit facility (the \"Senior Secured Credit Facilities\") consisting of (1) a multi currency revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in April 2022 and (2) a senior secured term loan facility scheduled to mature in April 2024 (the \"2024 Term Loan\"); (b) senior notes consisting of Senior Notes due 2025; and (c) other long term indebtedness, consisting of capital lease obligations, notes payable, seller notes and borrowings against certain lines of credit. Our debt could have important negative consequences to our business, including:. <U+0095> increasing the difficulty of our ability to make payments on our outstanding debt;    <U+0095> increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions because our debt payment obligations may limit our ability to use our cash to respond to or defend against changes in the industry or the economy;    <U+0095> requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities or to pay dividends;    <U+0095> limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;    <U+0095> limiting our ability to pursue our strategy;    <U+0095> limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions; and    <U+0095> placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged.. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in the senior secured credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture governing our outstanding Senior Notes due 2025. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our senior secured credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture governing our outstanding Senior Notes due 2025 restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the. 104. Table of Contents. disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.. Repayment of our debt is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries and their ability to make distributions to us or return cash via other repatriation strategies.. Our subsidiaries own a significant portion of our assets and conduct a significant portion of our operations. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent, to a significant extent, on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Because the majority of our indebtedness is denominated in U.S. dollars, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the local currencies in countries where we have significant operations has an adverse impact on our cash flows when translated into U.S. dollars and, accordingly, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to repay the obligations under our outstanding indebtedness. Unless they are guarantors of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities or our outstanding notes, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries include foreign subsidiaries and they may be prohibited by law or other regulations from distributing funds to us and/or we may be subject to payment of repatriation taxes and withholdings. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries account for substantially all of our total revenue, our total Adjusted EBITDA, and our total assets and our total liabilities (other than our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and our outstanding Senior Notes due 2025). While the senior secured credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture governing our outstanding Senior Notes due 2025 limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries or receive cash via other cash repatriation strategies for services rendered and intellectual property, or if the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies significantly reduces the amount of such distributions when translated into U.S. dollars, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.. Our debt agreements contain, and future debt agreements may contain, restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business.. The senior secured credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture governing our outstanding Senior Notes due 2025 contain various covenants that may limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and our restricted subsidiaries' ability to, among other things:. <U+0095> pay dividends and make certain distributions, investments and other restricted payments;    <U+0095> incur additional indebtedness, issue disqualified stock or issue certain preferred shares;    <U+0095> sell assets;    <U+0095> enter into transactions with affiliates;    <U+0095> create certain liens or encumbrances;    <U+0095> preserve our corporate existence;    <U+0095> merge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and. 105. Table of Contents. <U+0095> designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.. In addition, the senior secured credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities provides for compliance with the Consolidated Senior Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio, as defined in the senior secured credit agreement, solely with respect to the revolving line of credit facility, which is tested quarterly. The maximum ratio, as defined, was 5.3x, 4.5x and 3.75x at December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we satisfied certain conditions under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities; therefore, we were not subject to this leverage ratio covenant as of December 31, 2017.. The senior secured credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture governing our outstanding Senior Notes due 2025 also include cross-default provisions applicable to other agreements. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the agreement governing such indebtedness, including as a result of cross-default provisions. In addition, failure to make payments or observe certain covenants on the indebtedness of our subsidiaries may cause a cross default on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and our outstanding Senior Notes due 2025. Upon our failure to maintain compliance with these covenants, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders under such indebtedness accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings, as well as our other indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness.. We rely on contractual arrangements and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our operating subsidiaries to meet our debt service and other obligations.. We conduct all of our operations through certain of our subsidiaries, and we have no significant assets other than cash of $11.3 million as of December 31, 2017 held at corporate entities and the capital stock or other control rights of our subsidiaries. As a result, we rely on payments from contractual arrangements, such as intellectual property royalty, network fee and management services agreements. In addition, we also rely upon intercompany loan repayments and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet any existing or future debt service and other obligations, a substantial portion of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make distributions or other payments to their parent companies or directly to us will depend on their respective operating results and may be restricted by, among other things, the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization, regulatory requirements, agreements entered into by those operating subsidiaries and the covenants of any existing or future outstanding indebtedness that we or our subsidiaries may incur. For example, our VIE institutions generally are not permitted to pay dividends. Further, because most of our income is generated by our operating subsidiaries in non-U.S. dollar denominated currencies, our ability to service our U.S. dollar denominated debt obligations may be affected by any strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the functional currencies of our operating subsidiaries.. Disruptions of the credit and equity markets worldwide may impede or prevent our access to the capital markets for additional funding to expand our business and may affect the availability or cost of borrowing under our existing senior secured credit facilities.. The credit and equity markets of both mature and developing economies have historically experienced extraordinary volatility, asset erosion and uncertainty, leading to governmental intervention in the banking sector in the United States and abroad. If these market disruptions occur in the future, we may not be able to access the capital markets to obtain funding needed to refinance our existing. 106. Table of Contents. indebtedness or expand our business. In addition, changes in the capital or other legal requirements applicable to commercial lenders may affect the availability or increase the cost of borrowing under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. If we are unable to obtain needed capital on terms acceptable to us, we may need to limit our growth initiatives or take other actions that materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. Failure to obtain additional capital in the future could materially adversely affect our ability to grow.. We believe that our cash flows from operations, cash, investments and borrowings under our multi-currency revolving credit facility will be adequate to fund our current operating plans for the foreseeable future. However, we may need additional debt or equity financing in order to finance our continued growth and to fund the put/call arrangements with certain minority stockholders. In addition, we may be required to buy additional interests in certain higher education institutions and redeem the shares of our Series A Preferred Stock at specified times in the future. The amount and timing of such additional financing will vary principally depending on the timing and size of acquisitions and new institution openings, the willingness of sellers to provide financing for future acquisitions and the cash flows from our operations. Given current global macro conditions, companies with emerging market exposure have been more affected by recent market volatility, which has been reflected in the trading level of our Senior Notes due 2025, which have at various times traded at a significant discount to par. During the second quarter of 2015, one of the leading U.S. credit rating agencies downgraded our credit rating one notch and during the second quarter of 2016, another of the leading U.S. credit rating agencies downgraded our credit rating one notch. A significantly discounted trading price for our Senior Notes due 2025, as well as the reduced credit rating, could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain additional debt financing in the future. To the extent that we require additional financing in the future and are unable to obtain such additional financing, we may not be able to fully implement our strategy.. Our variable rate debt exposes us to interest rate risk which could materially adversely affect our cash flow.. Borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and certain local credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and other debt we incur also could be variable-rate debt. If market interest rates increase, variable-rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could materially adversely affect our cash flow. If these rates were to increase significantly, the risks related to our substantial debt would intensify. While we have and may in the future enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher interest rates, any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk. Based on our outstanding variable-rate debt as of December 31, 2017, after factoring in the impact of derivatives, an increase of 1% in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately $13.4 million on an annual basis.. Risks Relating to Investing in Our Class A Common Stock. Our status as a public benefit corporation may not result in the benefits that we anticipate.. We are a public benefit corporation under Delaware law. As a public benefit corporation we are required to balance the financial interests of our stockholders with the best interests of those stakeholders materially affected by our conduct, including particularly those affected by the specific benefit purpose relating to education set forth in our certificate of incorporation. In addition, there is no assurance that the expected positive impact from being a public benefit corporation will be realized. Accordingly, being a public benefit corporation and complying with our related obligations could negatively impact our ability to provide the highest possible return to our stockholders.. 107. Table of Contents. As a public benefit corporation, we are required to publicly disclose a report at least biennially on our overall public benefit performance and on our assessment of our success in achieving our specific public benefit purpose. If we are not timely or are unable to provide this report, or if the report is not viewed favorably by parties doing business with us or regulators or others reviewing our credentials, our reputation and status as a public benefit corporation may be harmed.. As a public benefit corporation, our focus on a specific public benefit purpose and producing a positive effect for society may negatively influence our financial performance.. As a public benefit corporation, we may take actions that we believe will benefit our students and the surrounding communities, even if those actions do not maximize our short- or medium-term financial results. While we believe that this designation and obligation will benefit the Company given the importance to our long-term success of our commitment to education, it could cause our board of directors to make decisions and take actions not in keeping with the short-term or more narrow interests of our stockholders. Any longer-term benefits may not materialize within the timeframe we expect or at all and may have an immediate negative effect. For example:. <U+0095> we may choose to revise our policies in ways that we believe will be beneficial to our students and their communities in the long term, even though the changes may be costly in the short- or medium-term;    <U+0095> we may take actions, such as modernizing campuses to provide students with the latest technology, even though these actions may be more costly than other alternatives;    <U+0095> in exiting a market that is not meeting our goals, we may choose to \"teach out\" the existing student body over several years rather than lose an institution; even though this could be substantially more expensive;    <U+0095> we may be influenced to pursue programs and services to demonstrate our commitment to our students and communities even though there is no immediate return to our stockholders; or    <U+0095> in responding to a possible proposal to acquire the Company, our board of directors may be influenced by the interests of our employees, students, teachers and others whose interests may be different from the interests of our stockholders.. We may be unable or slow to realize the long-term benefits we expect from actions taken to benefit our students and communities in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.. The price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.. We completed our IPO in February 2017. Since our IPO, the price of our Class A common stock, as reported by the Nasdaq Global Select Market, has ranged from a low of $10.46 on November 15, 2017 to a high of $18.96 on June 28, 2017. The trading price of our Class A common stock may continue to fluctuate and is dependent upon a number of factors, including those described in this \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock as you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid, or at all. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our Class A common stock include the following:. <U+0095> quarterly variations in our results of operations;    <U+0095> results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;. 108. Table of Contents. <U+0095> results of operations that vary from those of our competitors;    <U+0095> changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;     <U+0095> our or our competitors' introduction of new institutions, new programs, concepts or pricing policies;     <U+0095> announcements by us, our competitors or our vendors of significant acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;    <U+0095> changes in laws or conditions in the education industry, the financial markets or the economy as a whole;     <U+0095> failure of any of our institutions to secure or maintain accreditation or licensure;    <U+0095> announcements of regulatory or other investigations, adverse regulatory action by any regulatory body including those overseas or the DOE, state agencies or accrediting agencies, regulatory scrutiny of our operations or operations of our competitors or lawsuits filed against us or our competitors;     <U+0095> announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us;    <U+0095> the size of our public float;    <U+0095> changes in senior management or key personnel;    <U+0095> changes in our dividend policy;    <U+0095> adverse resolution of new or pending litigation against us;    <U+0095> the occurrence of any event described in \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\";    <U+0095> issuances, exchanges or sales, or expected issuances, exchanges or sales of our capital stock; and    <U+0095> general domestic and international economic conditions.. In the past, following periods of market volatility, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of our management team from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation.. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our Class A common stock is low. As a result, you may suffer a loss on your investment.. If we or our existing investors sell or announce an intention to sell additional shares of our Class A common stock, and when all outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock are converted into shares of our Class A common stock, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline.. The market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of Class A common stock in the market, or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to raise capital through future sales of equity securities at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate, or at all.. The holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock may convert their shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of our Class A common stock at any time. We expect to issue an aggregate of approximately 35.3 million to 40.0 million shares of Class A common stock if all such shares of Series A Preferred Stock are converted. Depending on when and in what manner the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are converted, or may be sold pursuant to a registration statement or. 109. Table of Contents. Rule 144, the shares of Class A common stock issued upon conversion may or may not be subject to any lock up agreements and may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, depending on their holding period and subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates.. As of December 31, 2017, 132,442,994 shares of our Class B common stock were outstanding. Such amount excludes 1,772,374 shares of Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding vested stock options under the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the \"2007 Plan\"), 6,512,946 shares of Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding vested stock options under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the \"2013 Plan\"), 150,987 shares of Class B common stock subject to outstanding unvested stock options under the 2013 Plan, 1,646,946 shares of Class A common stock and/or Class B common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2013 Plan, 7,432 shares of Class B common stock reserved for future issuance under the Laureate Education, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the \"Deferred Compensation Plan\"), and all shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. See Note 19, Benefit Plans, in our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Deferred Compensation Plan. All of our outstanding shares of Class B common stock became eligible for sale on August 5, 2017. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class B common stock, which will automatically convert into Class A common stock upon sale, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.. Because we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, and our debt arrangements and the Series A Preferred Stock place certain restrictions on our ability to do so, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.. We may retain future earnings, if any, for future operation, expansion, debt repayment and the possible mandatory redemption of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of the certificate of designations governing our Series A Preferred Stock (the \"Certificate of Designations\") and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions on dividends imposed by the Certificate of Designations and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur, including our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture governing our outstanding notes, and the terms of our Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, we are permitted under the terms of our debt instruments to incur additional indebtedness, which may restrict or prevent us from paying dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, our ability to declare and pay dividends may be limited by instruments governing future outstanding indebtedness we may incur. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our Class A common stock unless you sell your Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.. The dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our certificate of incorporation has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to our initial public offering, including Wengen and our executive officers, employees and directors and their affiliates, and limiting your ability to influence corporate matters.. Each share of our Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and each share of our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of December 31, 2017, stockholders who hold shares of Class B common stock, including Wengen, and our executive officers, employees and directors and their affiliates, together hold approximately 96.0% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, and. 110. Table of Contents. therefore have significant influence over the management affairs of the Company and control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets, for the foreseeable future. Because of the 10-to-1 voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock even when the shares of Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock.. The Wengen Investors have control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and the ability to prevent any transaction that requires stockholder approval regardless of whether others believe that the transaction is in our best interests. So long as the Wengen Investors continue to have an indirect interest in a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock, they have the ability to control the vote in any election of directors. This concentrated control limits your ability to influence corporate matters. The interests of the Wengen Investors and other holders of Class B common stock may not coincide with the interests of holders of the Class A common stock. In addition, in connection with the completion of our IPO, we entered into a new Wengen Securityholders' Agreement dated as of February 6, 2017, by and among Wengen, Laureate and the other parties thereto (as amended and restated from time to time, the \"Wengen Securityholders' Agreement\"), pursuant to which certain of the Wengen Investors have certain rights to appoint directors to our board of directors and its committees.. In addition, the Wengen Investors are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies and may hold, and may from time to time in the future acquire, interests in or provide advice to businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours.. The Certificate of Designations governing the terms of our Series A Preferred Stock contains rights and privileges that may adversely affect the holders of our Class A common stock, and, if we are unable to redeem the shares of Series A Preferred Stock when required, the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock could take control of our board of directors and force a sale of the Company.. So long as there are shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding, the holders of such security are entitled to annual dividends and have seniority upon any distribution of the Company's cash and other assets. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock also have veto power over certain corporate matters, such as (i) amending or repealing any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws that would adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock, including any amendment that would increase or decrease the authorized number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, and (ii) if it is not a follow-on public offering after our initial public offering in which the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock receive net proceeds not less than the Priority Amount, the first public offering of our common stock following a QPO (as defined below) or an initial public offering that is not a QPO. The holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock may have interests adverse to holders of our Class A common stock and the exercise of such rights may have a negative impact on the value of Class A common stock or the amount of cash or other assets the holders of our common stock may receive in connection with a distribution or merger, consolidation or share exchange.. In addition, if we fail to redeem the shares of Series A Preferred Stock when required after the fifth anniversary of the issue date, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to appoint two members to our board of directors and the dividend rate increases to 18.0% per annum. For a period of 120 days following the appointment of such directors, we must work in good faith with the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock to structure a mutually agreeable capital fundraising transaction to redeem the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock. If, after such 120 day period, any shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the holders of the Series A. 111. Table of Contents. Preferred Stock may nominate a number of individuals to our board of directors such that after such nomination the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock control a majority of our board of directors and, after which, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock may cause a sale of the Company and/or cause the Company to raise debt or equity capital in an amount sufficient to redeem the remaining outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock.. We are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the Nasdaq rules and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Holders of our securities do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.. Wengen controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the Nasdaq corporate governance standards. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \"controlled company\" and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:. <U+0095> the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;    <U+0095> the requirement that we have a nominating/corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities;    <U+0095> the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities; and    <U+0095> the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating/corporate governance and compensation committees.. We currently utilize these exemptions and intend to continue to do so. As a result, we do not have a majority of independent directors, our nominating and corporate governance committee and our compensation committee do not consist entirely of independent directors and such committees are not subject to annual performance evaluations. Accordingly, for so long as we are a \"controlled company,\" you will not have the same protections afforded to holders of securities of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq.. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, Certificate of Designations and bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us and could discourage a takeover and adversely affect the holders of our Class A common stock.. Provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of the Company, even if such change in control would be beneficial to the holders of our Class A common stock. These provisions include:. <U+0095> the dual class structure of our common stock;    <U+0095> authorizing the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;    <U+0095> prohibiting the use of cumulative voting for the election of directors;    <U+0095> as a public benefit corporation, requiring a two-thirds majority vote of the outstanding stock to effect a non-cash merger with an entity that is not a public benefit corporation with an identical public benefit;    <U+0095> limiting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings or amend our bylaws;. 112. Table of Contents. <U+0095> following the conversion of all of our Class B common stock into Class A common stock, requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;    <U+0095> establishing advance notice and duration of ownership requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and    <U+0095> certain protective provisions in favor of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock.. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team.. We may issue additional shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our Class A common stock, which could depress the price of our Class A common stock.. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue one or more additional series of preferred stock. Our board of directors has the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of any additional shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Additional series of preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our Class A common stock. The potential issuance of an additional series of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discourage bids for our Class A common stock at a premium to the market price, and materially adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our Class A common stock.. The provision of our certificate of incorporation requiring exclusive venue in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware for certain types of lawsuits may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\") or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or the bylaws or (d) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine will have to be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision many limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. 113. Table of Contents. If we do not maintain adequate coverage of our Class A common stock by securities analysts or if they publish unfavorable commentary about us or our industry or downgrade our Class A common stock, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.. The trading price for our Class A common stock could be affected by any research or reports that securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us or our business downgrade their evaluations of our Class A common stock, the price of our Class A common stock could decline. We may be unable to maintain adequate research coverage, and if one or more analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market for our Class A common stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline."
