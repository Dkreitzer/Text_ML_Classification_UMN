[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors.. An investment in the Company’s securities involves a high degree of risk. The Company operates in a dynamic and rapidly changing industry that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Other risks and uncertainties, including those that the Company does not currently consider material, may impair the Company’s business. If any of the risks discussed below actually occur, the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. This could cause the value of the Company’s securities to decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.. RISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY. Crusader is subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and any failure to meet these requirements could subject Crusader to regulatory action.. Crusader is subject to RBC standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under applicable laws of its state of domicile. The RBC standards, based upon the Risk-Based Capital Model Act adopted by the NAIC, require Crusader to report the results of RBC calculations to state departments of insurance and the NAIC. If Crusader fails to meet these standards and requirements, the CA DOI may require specified actions to be taken.. 13 of 83. The Company’s business is vulnerable to significant catastrophic property loss, which could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.. The Company faces a significant risk of loss in the ordinary course of its business for property damage resulting from natural disasters, man-made catastrophes and other catastrophic events, particularly hurricanes, earthquakes, hail storms, explosions, tropical storms, fires, sinkholes, war, acts of terrorism, severe winter weather and other natural and man-made disasters. Such events typically increase the frequency and severity of commercial property claims.  Because catastrophic loss events are by their nature unpredictable, historical results of operations may not be indicative of future results of operations, and the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events may result in substantial volatility in the Company’s financial condition and results of operations from period to period. Although the Company attempts to manage its exposure to such events, the occurrence of one or more major catastrophes in any given period could have a material and adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and could result in substantial outflows of cash as losses are paid.. Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect the Company’s consolidated financial statements.. The Company’s consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, the Company is required to adopt new or revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB. It is possible that future changes the Company is required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that the Company applies to its consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.. The Company’s success may depend on its ability to adjust claims accurately.. Many factors can affect the Company’s ability to adjust claims accurately, including the training, experience, and skill of the Company’s claims representatives, continued access to independent or outside adjusters, the extent of and ability to recognize and respond to fraudulent or inflated claims, the claims organization’s culture and the effectiveness of its management, the ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures, technologies, and systems to support claims functions. The Company’s failure to pay claims fairly, accurately, and in a timely manner, or to deploy claims resources appropriately, could result in unanticipated costs, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and the Company’s reputation in the marketplace, impair its brand image and, as a result, materially adversely affect its competitiveness, financial results, prospects, and liquidity.. Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are based on estimates and may not be sufficient to cover future losses.. Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves represent an estimate of amounts needed to pay and administer claims with respect to insured events that have occurred, including events that have occurred but have not yet been reported to Crusader. If claims exceed the related reserves, the Company may not have sufficient funds available to satisfy all such claims, and in any event, the Company’s operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. There is a high level of uncertainty inherent in the evaluation of the required loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for Crusader. The long-tailed nature of liability claims and the volatility of jury awards exacerbate that uncertainty. The difficulty in estimating the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves contributed to adverse development of insured events of prior years in the amount of $7,113,279 which Crusader experienced in 2017. Crusader sets loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at each balance sheet date based upon management’s best estimate of the ultimate payments that it anticipates will be made to settle all losses incurred and related loss adjustment expenses incurred as of that date for both reported and unreported losses. The ultimate cost of claims is dependent upon future events, the outcomes of which are affected by many factors. Crusader claim reserving procedures and settlement philosophy, current and perceived social and economic inflation, current and future court rulings and jury attitudes, improvements in medical technology, and many other economic, scientific, legal, political, and social factors all can have significant effects on the ultimate costs of claims. Changes in Crusader operations and management philosophy also may cause actual developments to vary from the past. Since the emergence and disposition of claims are subject to uncertainties, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle claims may vary significantly from the estimated amounts provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made.. 14 of 83. Changes in federal or state tax laws could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.. The Company’s financial condition and results of operations are dependent, in part, on tax policy implemented at the federal and/or state level. The Company’s results are also subject to federal and state tax rules applicable to dividends received from its subsidiaries. Additionally, changes in tax laws could have an adverse effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and results of operations. The Company cannot predict whether any tax legislation will be enacted in the near future or whether any such changes to existing federal or state tax law would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. The Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (“TCJA”), signed into law on December 22, 2017, reduced the corporate Federal income tax rate from 34% to 21%, effective for years beginning after December 31, 2017.  As a result of the TCJA, the Company had recognized a decrease to its net deferred asset as of December 31, 2017 in the amount of $2,176,862 and a one-time income tax charge of $2,137,385 for the year ended December 31, 2017.. Any inability of the Company to realize its deferred tax assets may have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences related to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases, and for tax credits.  The Company evaluates its deferred tax assets for recoverability based on available evidence, including assumptions about future profitability, reversal patterns of recorded deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, and capital gain generation. Although management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized, some or all of the Company’s deferred tax assets could expire unused if the Company is unable to generate taxable income of a sufficient nature in the future to utilize them.. If the Company determines it is more-likely-than-not that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, the Company would reduce the deferred tax asset through a charge to earnings in the period in which the determination is made. This charge could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the assumptions used to make this determination are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between the Company’s projected operating performance and actual results. As a result, management’s judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance.. The Company’s success depends on its ability to accurately underwrite risks and to charge adequate premium to policyholders.. The Company’s financial condition, liquidity and results of operations largely depend on the Company’s ability to underwrite and set premium accurately for the risks it faces. Premium rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premium to offset losses, loss adjustment expenses, underwriting expenses, and to earn a profit. In order to price its products accurately, the Company must collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data; develop, test and apply appropriate rating formulas; closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends; and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy. The Company’s ability to undertake these efforts successfully is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:. •           Availability of sufficient reliable data.      •           Incorrect or incomplete analysis of available data.      •           Uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions.      •           Selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies.      •           Adoption of successful pricing strategies.      •           Prediction of policyholder retention (e.g., policy life expectancy).      •           Unanticipated court decisions, legislation or regulatory action.      •           Ongoing changes in the Company’s claim settlement practices.      •           Unexpected inflation.      •           Social changes, particularly those affecting litigation patterns.. Such risks may result in the Company’s pricing being based on outdated, inadequate, or inaccurate data, or inappropriate analyses, assumptions, or methodologies, and may cause the Company to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. As a result, the Company could underprice risks, which would negatively affect the Company’s margins, or it could overprice risks, which could reduce the Company’s volume and competitiveness. In either event, the Company’s operating results, financial condition, and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.. 15 of 83. Inability to obtain reinsurance or to collect ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses could adversely affect Crusader’s ability to write new policies.. The availability, amount and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions and may vary significantly. Any decrease in the amount of Crusader’s reinsurance will increase the risk of loss and could materially adversely affect its business and financial condition. Ceded reinsurance does not discharge Crusader’s direct obligations under the policies it writes. Crusader remains liable to its policyholders even if it is unable to make recoveries that it believes it is entitled to under the reinsurance contracts. Losses may not be recovered from the reinsurers until claims are paid, which may create timing and liquidity risk. Additionally, any losses in excess of Crusader’s reinsurance limits would remain direct obligations of Crusader and would therefore have a negative impact to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2017, Crusader settled a claim which incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in excess of its reinsurance limits.. The insurance business is subject to extensive regulation and such regulation may become more extensive in the future, which may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.. Crusader is subject to extensive regulations and supervision in the states in which it operates or is licensed to conduct business. These regulations are generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders and not necessarily the interests of insurers, their stockholders or other investors. The regulations relate to authorization for lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, investment limitations, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, premium rates and a variety of other financial and nonfinancial components of an insurance company’s business. These powers include, among other things, the ability to:. •           Place limitations on Crusader’s investments and dividends.      •           Place limitations on Crusader’s ability to transact business with its affiliates.      •           Establish standards of solvency including minimum reserves and capital surplus requirements.      •           Prescribe the form and content of and to examine Crusader’s financial statements.. Federal legislation currently does not directly impact the property and casualty business, but the business can be indirectly affected by changes in federal regulations. From time to time, the U.S. Congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. The Company cannot predict whether, and to what extent, new laws and regulations that would affect its business will be adopted, the timing of any such adoption and what effects, if any, they may have on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company is unable to predict whether such laws will be enacted and how and to what extent this could affect the Company.. Crusader, along with other licensed insurers, is required to bear a portion of the losses suffered by some insureds as the result of impaired or insolvent insurance companies. In addition, Crusader must participate in mandatory arrangements to provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or other entities that otherwise are unable to purchase that coverage from private insurers. The effect of these and similar arrangements could reduce its profitability in any given period or limit its ability to grow the business. The NAIC and state insurance regulators are continually reexamining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to statutory accounting principles, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations.. The NAIC recently has undertaken a Solvency Modernization Initiative focused on updating the U.S. insurance solvency regulation framework, including capital requirements, governance and risk management, group supervision, accounting and financial reporting and reinsurance. On the federal level, the Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, mandated significant changes to the regulation of U.S. insurance effective as of July 21, 2011. Currently, the impact of these regulations has not materially affected the Company’s business. Any proposed or future state or federal legislation or NAIC initiatives, if adopted, may be more restrictive on the ability of Crusader to conduct business and/or may result in higher costs.. The extensive regulation to which the Company is subject may affect the cost of or demand for the Company’s products and may limit the ability to obtain rate increases or to take other actions that the Company might desire to do in order to increase its profitability.. 16 of 83. Unico is a holding company that relies on its subsidiaries to satisfy its obligations.. As a holding company, Unico does not generate revenue sufficient to pay operating expenses or stockholders’ dividends. Consequently, Unico relies on the ability of its subsidiaries to meet its obligations. The ability of Crusader to pay dividends to Unico is regulated by state insurance laws, which limit the amount of, and in certain circumstances may prohibit the payment of, cash dividends. The inability of Crusader to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable Unico to meet its cash requirements could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, and its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders.. A downgrade in the financial strength rating of the insurance company could reduce the amount of business it may be able to write.. Rating agencies rate insurance companies based on financial strength as an indication of an ability to pay claims. The financial strength rating of A.M. Best is subject to periodic review using, among other things, proprietary capital adequacy models and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. Insurance financial strength ratings are directed toward the concerns of policyholders and insurance agents and are not intended for the protection of investors. Any downgrade in Crusader’s A.M. Best rating could cause a reduction in the number of policies it writes and could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial position. On December 14, 2017, A.M. Best Company reaffirmed Crusader’s Financial Strength Rating of A- (Excellent) and Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating of a- (Excellent), and revised the rating outlook to “negative” from “stable.” The negative outlook reflects A.M. Best’s concerns with Crusader’s recent declining underwriting performance as well as some of its recent underwriting and marketing leadership changes, as previously disclosed, and the execution risk that comes with such changes.. The Company’s earnings may be affected by changes in interest rates.. Investment income is an important component of the Company’s revenues and net income. The ability to achieve investment objectives is affected by factors that are beyond the Company’s control. Many of the instruments in which the Company may invest are subject to interest rate risk. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Any significant decline in investment income as a result of falling interest rates or general market conditions may have an adverse effect on net income and, as a result, on the Company’s stockholders' equity and statutory surplus.. The outlook for the Company’s investment income is dependent on the composition of its investment portfolio, the future direction of interest rates and the amount of cash flows from operations that are available for investment. The fair values of fixed maturity investments that are \"available-for-sale\" fluctuate with changes in interest rates and cause fluctuations in stockholders' equity.. The Company’s investments may be subject to credit, prepayment and other risks.. The Company’s new investment guidelines allow investing in new classes of securities which are subject to additional risks. Rating errors by agencies, such as Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch, and/or economic downturn may create credit risk, a decline in interest rates may create prepayment risk, and a decrease in tax rates may reduce attractiveness of state and municipal bonds and may impact their market valuation. Any significant loss on investments or general market downturn may have an adverse effect on the Company’s stockholders' equity and statutory surplus and its business.. The Company’s geographic concentration ties its performance to the business, economic, and regulatory conditions in California.. The Company’s insurance business is concentrated in California (99.7% and 99.5% of direct written premium (before reinsurance ceded) in 2017 and 2016, respectively). Accordingly, unfavorable business, economic or regulatory conditions in the state of California could negatively impact the Company’s performance. In addition, California is exposed to severe natural perils, such as earthquakes and fires along with the possibility of terrorist acts. Accordingly, the Company could suffer losses as a result of catastrophic events.. The Company relies on independent insurance agents and brokers.. The failure or inability of independent insurance agents and brokers to market the Company’s insurance programs successfully could have a materially adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. Independent brokers are not obligated to promote the Company’s insurance programs and may sell competitors' insurance programs. The Company’s business largely depends on the marketing efforts of independent brokers and on the Company’s ability to offer insurance programs and services that meet the requirements of the customers of those brokers.. 17 of 83. The Company’s reserve for doubtful accounts is based on estimates.. The Company may not be able to collect the premiums it estimates are collectible from its agents and brokers and, therefore, the Company’s reserve for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient.. Litigation may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.. The Company’s is routinely involved in litigation, which can be unpredictable and costly, and may result in negative effects on the Company’s business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. By virtue of the nature of its business, the Company is subject to numerous legal proceedings in which it may be named as either plaintiff or defendant. Such disputes may concern the issuance or non-issuance of individual insurance policies, coverage disputes or other matters. In addition, the insurance industry is the target of class action lawsuits and other types of litigation, some of which involve claims for substantial and/or indeterminate amounts and the outcomes of which are unpredictable. This litigation can be based on a variety of issues including insurance and claim settlement practices. Although the Company has not been the target of any specific class action lawsuits, it is possible that a lawsuit of this type could have a negative impact on the Company’s business.. The exclusions and limitations in the Company’s policies may not be enforceable.. Many of the Company’s policies include exclusions or other conditions that define and limit coverage; these exclusions and conditions are designed to manage the Company’s exposure to certain types of risks and expanding theories of legal liability. In addition, many of the Company’s policies limit the period during which a policyholder may bring a claim under the policy; this period in many cases is shorter than the statutory period under which these claims can be brought by the policyholders. While these exclusions and limitations help the Company assess and control its loss exposure, it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or limitation, or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of these exclusions and limitations. This could result in higher than anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses by extending coverage beyond the Company’s underwriting intent or increasing the number or size of claims, which could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s operating results. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after the Company has issued the insurance policies that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under the Company’s insurance policies may not be known for many years after a policy is issued.. The Company relies on its information technology systems to manage many aspects of its business; and any failure of these systems to function properly or any interruption in their operation could result in a materially adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.. The Company depends on the security, accuracy, reliability, and proper functioning of its information technology systems. The Company relies on these information technology systems to effectively manage many aspects of its business, including underwriting, policy acquisition, claims processing and handling, accounting, reserving and actuarial processes and policies, and maintaining its policyholder data. The failure of hardware or software that supports the Company’s information technology systems or the loss of data contained in the systems could disrupt its business and could result in decreased premiums, increased overhead costs, and inaccurate reporting, all of which could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for the Company’s information technology systems, these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from events such as:. •           Earthquake, fire, flood, and other natural disasters.      •           Terrorism acts and attacks by computer viruses or hackers.      •           Power loss.      •           Unauthorized access.      •           Computer systems or data network failure.. It is possible that a system failure, accident, security breach, or unauthorized internal or external knowledge, or misuse of confidential Company data could result in a material disruption to the Company’s business and reputation. In addition, substantial costs may be incurred to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions. To the extent that a critical system fails or is not properly implemented and the failure cannot be corrected in a timely manner, the Company may experience disruptions to the business that could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations. In addition, the costs associated with the development or acquisition of new computer software, such as in the case of the Company’s planned replacement of its policy administration system, may result in impairment charges if such acquisition or development is not successfully implemented. Any such impairment charges would adversely impact the Company’s results of operation.. 18 of 83. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all acts of fraud.. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management and is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. The Company’s management believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been prevented or detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by an unauthorized override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and the Company cannot ensure that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.. Changes in general economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the Company’s revenues and profitability.. The Company’s financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted by national and local economic conditions, such as recessions, increased levels of unemployment, inflation and the disruption in the financial markets. The Company is not able to predict the effect of these factors or their duration and severity.. The Company depends on key personnel, the loss of which could negatively impact it business.. The Company’s current and future success is dependent to a large extent on the retention and continued service of its key personnel, which includes its executive officers. The loss or unavailability of any key personnel, which includes executive officers, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.. The ability of the Company to attract, develop and retain employees and to maintain appropriate staffing levels is critical to the Company’s success.. The Company must hire and train new employees and retain current employees to handle its operations. The failure of the Company to successfully hire and retain a sufficient number of skilled employees could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.. The Company’s financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties that have significant contracts or relationships with the Company become insolvent, experience other financial difficulties, or default in the performance of obligations.. The Company’s business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or services arrangements. These include, for example, contracts for the acquisition of goods and services (such as telecommunications and information technology facilities, equipment and support, and other systems and services that are integral to its operations), agreements with independent or outside claim adjusters, agreements with other insurance carriers to sell products that the Company does not offer, and arrangements for transferring certain risks (including reinsurance used in connection with certain insurance products and corporate insurance policies). The Company is also dependent on its dealings with banks and other financial institutions. If one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system, product, or service that is significant to the Company’s business, it could suffer significant financial losses and operational interruptions or other problems, which could in turn adversely affect its financial performance, cash flows, or results of operations and cause damage to its brand and reputation.. The property casualty insurance industry is highly competitive, and the Company may not be able to compete effectively against larger and/or better capitalized companies.. The Company faces intense competition in the property and casualty insurance industry. Competition in the property and casualty marketplace is based on many factors including premiums charged, services provided, financial strength ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payments, reputation, perceived financial strength, technology, and general experience. The Company competes with many regional and national property and casualty insurance companies. Many of these competitors are better capitalized than the Company, have greater financial, marketing and management resources than the Company, and have higher A.M. Best ratings. The superior capitalization, resources and ratings of the Company’s competitors may enable them to offer lower rates, to withstand larger losses, and to more effectively take advantage of new marketing opportunities and attract new customers. Intense competitive pressure on prices can result from the actions of even a single large competitor. The Company’s competition may also become increasingly better capitalized in the future as the traditional barriers between insurance companies and banks and other financial institutions erode and as the property and casualty industry continues to consolidate.. 19 of 83. The Company may undertake strategic marketing and operating initiatives to improve its competitive position and drive growth. If the Company is unable to successfully implement new strategic initiatives or if the Company’s marketing campaigns do not attract new customers, the Company’s competitive position may be harmed, which could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.. RISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY’S STOCK. The Company’s goal is to maximize the long-term value of the enterprise and thus does not focus on short-term earnings expectations.. The Company does not manage its business to maximize short-term stock performance. It also does not provide earnings estimates to the market and does not comment on earnings estimates by analysts. As a result, its reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps significantly, from investors’ expectations, which could result in significant volatility in the price of its common shares.. In addition, due to the Company’s focus on the long-term value of an enterprise, it may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance its longer-term performance, while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit short-term results, such as its annual underwriting profit or earnings per share.. The Company is controlled by a small number of shareholders who will be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval.. Messrs. Erwin Cheldin, Cary L. Cheldin, and George C. Gilpatrick, who hold approximately 50.16% of the voting power of the Company, have agreed to vote the shares of common stock held by each of them so as to elect each of them to the Board of Directors and to vote on all other matters as they may agree. As a result of this agreement, the Company is a “Controlled Company” as defined in the NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ) Listing Rules. A Controlled Company is exempt from the requirements of the NASDAQ Listing Rules requiring that (i) the Company have a majority of independent directors on the Board of Directors, (ii) the Compensation Committee be composed solely of independent directors, (iii) the compensation of the executive officers be determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors and (iv) director nominees be elected or recommended either by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee comprised solely of independent directors.. Accordingly, Messrs. Erwin Cheldin, Cary L. Cheldin, and George C. Gilpatrick have the ability to exert significant influence on the actions the Company may take in the future, including change of control transactions. This concentration of ownership may conflict with the interests of the Company’s other shareholders.. Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on the Company’s stock price.. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC require the Company to include in its Form 10-K a report by its management regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The report includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of its fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified by management. Areas of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting may require improvement from time to time. If management is unable to assert that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective now or in any future period, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of the Company’s financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on its stock price.. 20 of 83. Insurance laws make it difficult to effect a change of control of the Company or the sale of any subsidiaries.. To acquire control of a U.S. insurance company or any holding company of a U.S. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the Department of Insurance in the state where the insurer is domiciled. The Department of Insurance of the state will consider a number of factors relating to the acquirer and the transaction prior to granting approval of the application to acquire control of the insurer or the holding company. These laws and regulations may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of the Company or the sale by the Company of any of its insurance subsidiaries, including transactions that some or all of the Company’s shareholders might consider to be desirable."
