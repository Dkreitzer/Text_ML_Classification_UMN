[1] "ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORS.. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results and financial condition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report and our other reports and documents filed with the SEC, the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we may currently deem immaterial also may impair our business, financial condition, operating results and/or stock price. If any of the following risks or such other risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, operating results and/or stock price could be harmed. In the following factors, “volatility in our share price”, “adverse impact on the price (or value) of our shares”, “decline in the price of our common stock” and similar terms also refer to our warrants and shares to be received upon exercise of our warrants.. Risks Relating to Our Business:. We have have not produced significant revenues. This makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and increases the risk that we will not be successful.. Our operations since inception have produced limited revenues, and may not produce significant revenues in the near term, or at all, which may harm our ability to obtain additional financing and may require us to reduce or discontinue our operations. If we create significant revenues in the future, we expect to derive most of such revenues from the sale of supply chain security and product authentication solutions. You must consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we will encounter as a company operating in a rapidly evolving industry. We may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties, which could significantly harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.. 21. We have a history of net losses which may continue, and which may harm our ability to obtain financing and continue our operations.. We incurred net losses of $12.9 million and $12.2 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These net losses have principally been the result of the various costs associated with our selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses as we expanded operations, acquired, developed and validated technologies and expanded marketing activities. Our operations are subject to the risks and competition inherent in a company that moved from the development stage to an operating company. We may not generate sufficient revenues from operations to achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly, annual or any other basis in the future. Our revenues and profits, if any, will depend upon various factors, including whether our existing products and services or any new products and services we develop will achieve market acceptance. If we continue to incur losses, then our accumulated deficit will continue to increase which may significantly impair our ability to obtain additional financing. As a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be significantly harmed, and we may be required to reduce or terminate our operations.. If we are unable to obtain additional financing our business operations may be harmed or discontinued.. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our future revenues and our ability to commercialize more products, obtain additional capital and attain profitable operations. We may require additional funds to complete the continued development and commercialization of our products, product manufacturing, and to fund expected additional losses from operations, until revenues are sufficient to cover our operating expenses. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining any necessary additional financing, we will most likely be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.. Our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction in business with our significant customers.. Our revenue earned from the sale of products and services for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 included an aggregate of 78% of our total revenues from four customers. These four customers accounted for approximately 97% of our total accounts receivable at September 30, 2017. At September 30, 2017, one customer accounted for an aggregate of 80% of our total accounts receivable. Our revenues earned from sale of products and services for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 included an aggregate of 75% from three customers of our total revenues. These three customers accounted for approximately 20% of our total accounts receivable at September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, one customer accounted for 78% of our total accounts receivable. Generally, our customers do not have an obligation to make purchases from us and may stop ordering our products and services or may terminate existing orders or contracts at any time with little or no financial penalty. The loss of any of our significant customers, any substantial decline in sales to these customers, or any significant change in the timing or volume of purchases by our customers could result in lower revenues and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.. If our existing products and services are not accepted by potential customers or if we fail to introduce new products and services, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be harmed.. There has been limited market acceptance of our DNA based technology, encapsulation, embedment and authentication products and services to date. Some of the factors that will affect whether we achieve market acceptance of our solutions include:. ·availability,                                          quality and price relative to competitive solutions;. ·customers’                                          opinions of the solutions’ utility;. ·ease of use;. ·consistency                                          with prior practices;. ·scientists’                                          opinions of the solutions’ usefulness; and. ·general trends                                          in anti-counterfeit and security solutions’ research.. Dependence on channel partners.. Our future growth will depend to a material extent on the successful advocacy of our technology by channel partners to their members and customers, and implementation of our technology in solutions propagated by channel partners and provided by third parties. Our business has relied on the success of business partners. Our continuing success is largely dependent on a new generation of business partners involved in our tagging technology.. If our channel partners are not successful in advocating and deploying our technology, we may not be able to achieve and sustain profitable operations. If other business partners who include our technology in their products or otherwise license our intellectual property for use in their products cease to do so, or we fail to obtain other partners who will incorporate, embed, integrate or bundle our technology, or these partners are unsuccessful in their efforts, expanding deployment of our technology and increasing revenues will be adversely affected. Consequently, our ability to increase revenue could be adversely affected and we may suffer other adverse effects to our business. In addition, if our technology does not perform according to market expectations, our future sales would suffer as customers seek and employ alternative technologies.. 22. Many of our business endeavors can be impeded or frustrated by larger, more influential companies or by standard-setting bodies or institutions downplaying, minimizing or rejecting the value or use of our technology. A negative position by such companies, bodies or institutions, could result in obstacles for us that we would be incapable of overcoming and may block or impede the adoption of our technology. In addition, potential customers may delay or reject initiatives that relate to deployment of our technology. Such a development would make the achievement of our business objectives in this market difficult or impossible.. The expenses or losses associated with lack of widespread market acceptance of our solutions may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.. Rapid technological changes and frequent new product introductions are typical in the markets we serve. Our future success may depend in part on continuous, timely development and introduction of new products that address evolving market requirements. We believe successful new product introductions may provide a significant competitive advantage because customers invest their time in selecting and learning to use new products, and once invested in the new technology, are often reluctant to switch products. To the extent we fail to introduce new and innovative products, we may lose any market share we then have to our competitors, which will be difficult or impossible to regain. Any inability, for technological or other reasons, to successfully develop and introduce new products could reduce our growth rate or damage our business. We may experience delays in the development and introduction of products. We may not keep pace with the rapid rate of change in anti-counterfeiting and security products’ research, and any new products acquired or developed by us may not meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance.. We need to expand our sales, marketing and support organizations and our distribution arrangements to increase market acceptance of our products and services.. We currently have a limited number of sales, marketing, customer service and support personnel and may need to increase our staff to generate a greater volume of sales and to support any new customers or the expanding needs of existing customers. The employment market for sales, marketing, customer service and support personnel in our industry is very competitive, and we may not be able to hire the kind and number of sales, marketing, customer service and support personnel we are targeting. Our inability to hire qualified sales, marketing, customer service and support personnel may harm our business, operating results and financial condition. While we have entered into a limited number of agreements with distributors, we may not be able to sufficiently build out a distribution network or enter into arrangements with qualified distributors on acceptable terms or at all. If we are not able to develop greater distribution capacity, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to support our operations.. If we are unable to continue to retain the services of Dr. Hayward, we may not be able to continue our operations.. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of Dr. James A. Hayward, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. On July 28, 2016, we entered into a new employment agreement with Dr. Hayward. The initial term is from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017, with automatic one-year renewal periods. As of June 30, 2017, the employment contract renewed for an additional year. Loss of the services of Dr. Hayward could significantly harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We do not maintain key-person insurance on the life of Dr. Hayward.. The markets for our supply chain security and product authentication solutions are very competitive, and we may be unable to continue to compete effectively in these industries in the future.. The principal markets for our offerings are intensely competitive. We compete with many existing suppliers and new competitors continue to enter the market. Many of our competitors, both in the United States and elsewhere, are major pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnology companies, or have strategic alliances with such companies, and many of them have substantially greater capital resources, marketing experience, research and development staff, and facilities than we do. Any of these companies could succeed in developing products that are more effective than the products that we have or may develop and may be more successful than us in producing and marketing their existing products. Some of our competitors that operate in the anti-counterfeiting and fraud prevention markets include: 3DTL Inc., Alp Vision Sa, Authentix Inc., Brandwatch Technologies, Chromologic LLC, Collectors Universe Inc., Collotype Labels International, Data Dot Technology, De La Rue Plc., Digimarc Corp., DNA Technologies, Inc., DuPont Authentication Systems, FractureCode Corporation, Haelixa, ICA Bremen GmbH, ID Global Solutions Corporation, IEHCorporationInformium AG,, Eastman Kodak Company, L-1 Identity Solutions Inc., opSec Security Group plc., MicroTagTemed Ltd., Nanotech Security Corp., Nokomis, Inc., ProoftagSAS, SafeTraces Inc., Selectamark Security Systems plc, Spectra Systems Corp., SmartWater Technology, Inc., Sun Chemical Corp, TraceTag International, TruTag Technologies Inc., YottaMark Inc., and Safe Traces, Inc.. We expect this competition to continue and intensify in the future. Competition in our markets is primarily driven by:. ·product performance,                                          features and liability;. ·price;. 23. ·timing of product                                          introductions;. ·ability to                                          develop, maintain and protect proprietary products and technologies;. ·sales and distribution                                          capabilities;. ·technical support                                          and service;. ·brand loyalty;. ·applications                                          support; and. ·breadth of                                          product line.. If a competitor develops superior technology or cost-effective alternatives to our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed.. Revenues from our customer contracts with respect to cotton will be seasonal and may also be subject to weather conditions and other factors beyond our control, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly quarterly and annually.. A significant and growing proportion of our revenues is expected to derive from customer contracts for tagging, authentications and other services related to cotton. The cotton ginning season in the United States takes place between September and March each year. Therefore, revenues from our customer contracts relating to cotton will be seasonal, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly quarterly and annually. Additionally, weather and climatic conditions, natural disasters and other factors beyond our control also affect the production and sale of cotton and other agricultural commodities to which our customer contracts may relate, as well as our customers’ or prospective customers’ decisions regarding purchases of our products and services, and may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly quarterly and annually. The seasonal fluctuations in operating results described above may cause a decline in the price of our common stock.. Fluctuations in quarterly results.. Our revenues and profitability are difficult to predict due to the nature of the markets in which we compete, fluctuating user demand, the uncertainty of current and future global economic conditions, and for many other reasons, including that our operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during a quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Customers generally order on an as-needed basis and we typically do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers.. Our research and development efforts for new products may be unsuccessful.. We incur research and development expenses to develop new products and technologies in an effort to maintain our competitive position in a market characterized by rapid rates of technological advancement. Our research and development efforts are subject to unanticipated delays, expenses and technical problems. There can be no assurance that any of these products or technologies will be successfully developed or that, if developed, will be commercially successful. In the event that we are unable to develop commercialized products from our research and development efforts or we are unable or unwilling to allocate amounts beyond our currently anticipated research and development investment, we could lose our entire investment in these new products and technologies. Any failure to translate research and development expenditures into successful new product introduction could have an adverse effect on our business.. Failure to license new technologies could impair sales of our existing products or any new product development we undertake in the future.. To generate broad product lines, it is advantageous to sometimes license technologies from third parties rather than depend exclusively on the development efforts of our own employees. As a result, we believe our ability to license new technologies from third parties may be important to our ability to offer new products. In addition, from time to time we are notified of, or become aware of patents held by third parties that are related to technologies we are selling or may sell in the future. After a review of these patents, we may decide to seek a license for these technologies from these third parties. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify new technologies developed by others. Even if we are able to identify new technologies of interest, we may not be able to negotiate a license on favorable terms, or at all.. Our failure to manage our growth in operations and acquisitions of new product lines and new businesses could harm our business.. The recent growth in our operations could place a significant strain on our current management resources. To manage such growth, we may need to improve our:. ·operations                                          and financial systems;. ·procedures                                          and controls; and. ·training and                                          management of our employees.. 24. Our future growth, if any, may be attributable to acquisitions of new product lines and new businesses. Future acquisitions, if successfully consummated, would likely create increased working capital requirements, which would likely precede by several months any material contribution of an acquisition to our net income. Our failure to manage growth or future acquisitions successfully could seriously harm our operating results. Also, acquisition costs could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Furthermore, our stockholders would be diluted if we financed the acquisitions by incurring convertible debt or issuing securities.. A percentage of our sales occur outside of the U.S. As a result, we are subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations.. For fiscal 2017 and 2016, 27% and 24%, respectively, of our revenue was from customers located outside of the U.S. We believe that the revenue from the sale of our products and services outside the U.S. will continue to grow in the near future. We intend to expand our international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available. Our foreign operations and sales could be adversely affected as a result of:. ·nationalization                                          of private enterprises and assets;. ·political or                                          economic instability in certain countries and regions;. ·differences                                          in foreign laws, including increased difficulties in protecting intellectual property                                          and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights;. ·the possibility                                          that foreign governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that could directly                                          or indirectly harm our business and growth strategy;. ·credit risks;. ·currency fluctuations;. ·tariff and                                          tax increases;. ·export and                                          import restrictions and restrictive regulations of foreign governments;. ·shipping products                                          during times of crisis or wars; and. ·other risks                                          inherent in foreign operations.. We are subject to numerous regulatory, legal, operational, and other risks as a result of our international operations which could adversely impact our businesses in many ways.. As a U.S. company, we are required to comply with the economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar multi-national bodies and governmental agencies worldwide, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). A violation of a sanction or embargo program or of the FCPA or similar laws prohibiting certain payments to governmental officials, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, could subject us, and individual employees, to a regulatory enforcement action as well as significant civil and criminal penalties which could adversely impact our business and operations.. Failure to attract and retain qualified scientific, production and managerial personnel could harm our business.. Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and production personnel to perform and manage prototype, sample, and product manufacturing and business development personnel to conduct business development are critical to our success. In addition, our desired growth and expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise, such as clinical testing, government approvals, production, sales and marketing will require the addition of new management personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel. Because our industry is very competitive, we face significant challenges in attracting and retaining a qualified personnel base. Although we believe we have been, and will continue to be, able to attract and retain these personnel, we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to successfully attract qualified personnel in the future. The failure to attract and retain these personnel or, alternatively, to develop this expertise internally would harm our business since our ability to conduct business development and manufacturing would be reduced or eliminated, resulting in lower revenues. We generally do not enter into employment agreements requiring our employees to continue in our employment for any period of time, with the exception of our Chief Executive Officer. See “—If we are unable to continue to retain the services of Dr. Hayward, we may not be able to continue our operations. “in this Item 1A.. 25. Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and brand.. Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and all of our other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. There are events that are outside of our control that pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products and services. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed. The efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained from one of our issued patents will be insufficient or deemed invalid or unenforceable. We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy could be compromised by third parties, or intentionally or accidentally by our employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets.. Intellectual property litigation could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights is extensive in the biotechnology industry. In the event of an intellectual property dispute, we may be forced to litigate. This litigation could involve proceedings instituted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or the International Trade Commission, as well as proceedings brought directly by affected third parties. Intellectual property litigation can be extremely expensive, and these expenses, as well as the consequences should we not prevail, could seriously harm our business.. If a third party claims an intellectual property right to technology we use, we might need to discontinue an important product or product line, alter our products and processes, pay license fees or cease our affected business activities. Although we might under these circumstances attempt to obtain a license to this intellectual property, we may not be able to do so on favorable terms, or at all. Furthermore, a third party may claim that we are using inventions covered by the third party’s patent rights and may go to court to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, including making or selling our products. These lawsuits are costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. A court may decide that we are infringing the third party’s patents and would order us to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, a court may order us to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party’s patents. The biotechnology industry has produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods of use either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent and/or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity, in particular, is difficult since it requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents.. Because some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing, and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our or our licensor’s issued patents or pending applications or that we or our licensors were the first to invent the technology. During the ordinary course of our business, we do not conduct “prior art” searches before filing a patent application. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our or our licensors’ patent applications and could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a United States patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our United States patent position with respect to such inventions.. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.. Accidents related to hazardous materials could adversely affect our business.. Some of our operations require the controlled use of hazardous materials for chemical reactions and synthesis. These materials are common to molecular/biological/chemical laboratories and require no special handling or regulation. Although we believe our safety procedures comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state, local and foreign regulations, the risk of accidental contamination of property or injury to individuals from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of an accident, we could be liable for any damages that result, which could seriously damage our business and results of operations.. Potential product liability claims could affect our earnings and financial condition.. We face a potential risk of liability claims based on our products and services. Though we have product liability insurance coverage which we believe is adequate, we may not be able to maintain this insurance at reasonable cost and on reasonable terms. We also cannot assure that this insurance, if obtained, will be adequate to protect us against a product liability claim, should one arise. In the event that a product liability claim is successfully brought against us, it could result in a significant decrease in our liquidity or assets, which could result in the reduction or termination of our business.. 26. Litigation generally could affect our financial condition and results of operations.. We generally may be subject to claims made by and required to respond to litigation brought by customers, former employees, former officers and directors, former distributors and sales representatives, former consultants and vendors and service providers. We have faced such claims and litigation in the past and we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to claims in the future. In the event that a claim is successfully brought against us, considering our lack of material revenue and the losses our business has incurred for the period from our inception to September 30, 2017, this could result in a significant decrease in our liquidity or assets, which could result in the reduction or termination of our business.. Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.. Our operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks or other vulnerabilities in our computer systems, terrorism, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, political or economic instability, and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.. General economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.. A general weakening or decline in the global economy or a period of economic slowdown may have serious negative consequences for our business and operating results. Since our customers incorporate our products into a variety of consumer goods, the demand for our products is subject to worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending. Some of the factors affecting consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors. During periods of economic weakness or uncertainty, demand for consumer goods incorporating our products may weaken, and current or potential customers may defer purchases of our products.. A cybersecurity incident and other technology disruptions could negatively affect our business and our relationships with customers.. We use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations. The widespread use of technology, including mobile devices, cloud computing, and the internet, give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including information relating to customers and suppliers, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about us and our business partners. If we fail to effectively assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with the use of technology in our business operations, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and competitive disadvantage.. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and Other Securities:. There are a large number of shares of common stock underlying our outstanding options and warrants and the sale of these shares may depress the market price of our common stock and cause immediate and substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.. As of December 22, 2017, we had 30,112,057 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, outstanding options to purchase 5,333,227 shares of common stock and outstanding warrants to purchase 12,275,455 shares of common stock. The issuance of shares upon exercise of our outstanding options and warrants will cause immediate and substantial dilution to our stockholders. In addition, under our publicly traded warrants (including additional warrants sold privately that have registration rights), in the event of a “Fundamental Transaction” (as defined in the related warrant agreement, which generally includes any merger with another entity, the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets to another entity, or the acquisition by a person of more than 50% of our common stock), each warrant holder will have the right at any time prior to the consummation of the Fundamental Transaction to require us to repurchase the warrant for a purchase price in cash equal to the Black Scholes value (as calculated under the warrant agreement) of the then remaining unexercised portion of such warrant on the date of such Fundamental Transaction, which may materially adversely affect our financial condition and/or results of operations.. We may require additional financing which may in turn require the issuance of additional shares of common stock, preferred stock or other debt or equity securities (including convertible securities) and which would dilute the ownership held by our stockholders.. We may need to raise funds through either debt or the sale of our shares of our common stock in order to achieve our business goals. Any additional shares issued would further dilute the percentage ownership held by the stockholders. Furthermore, if we raise funds in equity transactions through the issuance of convertible securities which are convertible at the time of conversion at a discount to the prevailing market price, substantial dilution is likely to occur resulting in a material decline in the price of your shares. Our public offerings completed in November 2014 and April 2015, our registered direct public offering (the “Registered Direct Offering”) and concurrent private placement, during November 2015, our private placements completed in November 2016 and June 2017 and our registered direct offering in December 2017 resulted in dilution to investors and future offerings of securities could result in further dilution to investors.. 27. We may require additional financing in the future, which may not be available or, if available, may be on terms that cause a decline in the value of the shares of our common stock held by stockholders.. If we raise capital in the future by issuing additional securities, our stockholders may experience a decline in the value of the shares of our common stock they currently hold or may acquire prior to any such financing. In addition, such securities may have rights senior to the rights of holders of our shares of common stock.. If we fail to comply with the continuing listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market, our securities could be delisted.. Our common stock and publicly traded warrants are listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols “APDN” and “APDNW,” respectively. For our common stock and publicly traded warrants to continue to be listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, we must meet the current continued listing requirements. If we were unable to meet these requirements, our common stock and warrants could be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market. If our securities were to be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market, our securities could begin to trade on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board or on one of the markets operated by OTC Markets Group, including OTC Pink (formerly known as the “pink sheets”), as the case may be. In such event, our securities could once again be subject to the “penny stock” rules which among other things require brokers or dealers to approve investors’ accounts, receive written agreements and determine investor suitability for transactions and disclose risks relating to investing in the penny stock market. Any such delisting of our securities could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for our securities, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and less coverage of us by securities analysts, if any. Also, if in the future we were to determine that we need to seek additional equity capital, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public or private equity markets.. Any material weaknesses in our internal control over financing reporting in the future could adversely affect investor confidence, impair the value of our common stock and increase our cost of raising capital.. Any failure to remedy deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that may be discovered or our failure to implement new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation of such controls, could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could, in turn, affect the future ability of our management to certify that internal control over our financial reporting is effective. Inferior internal control over financial reporting could also subject us to the scrutiny of the SEC and other regulatory bodies which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or stockholder litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the market price of our common stock.. In addition, if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market’s confidence in our financial statements and harm our share price. Furthermore, deficiencies could result in future non-compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Such non-compliance could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions, including review by the SEC or other regulatory authorities.. Short sellers of our stock may be manipulative and may drive down the market price of our common stock.. Short selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed or intends to borrow from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities at a later date to return to the lender. A short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is therefore in the short seller’s interest for the price of the stock to decline, some short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, opinions or characterizations regarding the relevant issuer, its business prospects and similar matters calculated to or which may create negative market momentum, which may permit them to obtain profits for themselves as a result of selling the stock short. Issuers whose securities have historically had limited trading volumes and/or have been susceptible to relatively high volatility levels can be particularly vulnerable to such short seller attacks. The publication of any such commentary regarding us in the future may bring about a temporary, or possibly long term, decline in the market price of our common stock. In the past, the publication of commentary regarding us by a disclosed short seller has been associated with the selling of shares of our common stock in the market on a large scale, resulting in a precipitous decline in the market price per share of our common stock. No assurances can be made that similar declines in the market price of our common stock will not occur in the future, in connection with such commentary by short sellers or otherwise.. 28. The price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline, and the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate, which may make it more difficult to realize a profit on your investment in our shares of common stock.. Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market. The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. In addition, the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for your shares of common stock, which may make it more difficult to realize a profit on your investment. A number of factors may affect the market price of our common stock, including, but not limited to, the following:. ·our operating                                          and financial performance and prospects;. ·our quarterly                                          or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry or that investors deem                                          comparable to us;. ·conditions that                                          impact demand for our products and services;. ·public reactions                                          to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;. ·market and industry                                          perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;. ·strategic actions                                          by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;. ·changes in accounting                                          standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;. ·arrival and departure                                          of key personnel, including management personnel;. ·changes in our                                          capital structure;. ·changes in the                                          price of our warrants or other securities we may issue from time to time;. ·sales of common                                          stock by us, our directors, officers or large stockholders;. ·the expiration                                          of any applicable contractual lock-up agreements;. ·changes in general                                          market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or                                          financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, terrorist attacks,                                          acts of war and responses to such events;. ·announcements                                          of new products or innovations by us or our competitors and announcements concerning                                          our competitors or our industry in general;. ·difficulties                                          in commercialization and distribution of our products or lower than expected sales volume                                          or revenues;. ·changes in our                                          relationships with manufacturers, suppliers or collaborators, or our inability to supply                                          enough product to meet demand;. ·our ability to                                          obtain additional funding;. ·changes or developments                                          in applicable laws or regulations;. ·any intellectual                                          property infringement actions or other litigation or legal proceeding in which we may                                          become involved;. ·changes in financial                                          estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, or their ceasing to publish research                                          or reports about our business;. ·the trading volume                                          of our common stock; and. ·the appeal and                                          current level of investor interest in the biotechnology/biopharmaceutical capital market                                          sector and in companies in general with business, research strategies and product development                                          pipelines which are similar to us.. In addition, The NASDAQ Capital Market and other securities markets have, from time to time, experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations. The market prices of securities of biotechnology and other life sciences companies in a comparable stage to ours historically have been particularly volatile, and trading volume in such securities and our common stock has often been relatively low. Moreover, the securities and financial markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results of any individual company. During certain periods, specific industry sectors, such as the biotechnology segment, may experience greater volatility than other sectors or the securities markets as a whole. These broad market fluctuations, during which our industry and companies at our stage may experience a stronger degree of market sensitivity, will adversely affect the market price of our common stock.. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. 29"
