[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Described below are risks, which are categorized as \"Risk Factors Relating to Our Business,\" \"Risk Factors Relating to the Regulatory Environment\" and \"Risk Factors Relating to Our Employees,\" that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. See \"Forward-Looking Statements\" that precedes Part I of this report. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial may in the future have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. Risk Factors Relating to Our Business. Potential costs related to the environmental cleanup of Portland Harbor may be material to our financial position and liquidity. In December 2000, we were notified by the EPA under CERCLA that we are one of the potentially responsible parties (\"PRPs\") that owns or operates or formerly owned or operated sites which are part of or adjacent to the Portland Harbor Superfund site (the \"Site\"). The precise nature and extent of any cleanup of the Site, the parties to be involved, the timing of any specific remedial action and the allocation of the costs for any cleanup among responsible parties have not yet been determined. The process of site investigation, remedy selection, identification of additional PRPs and allocation of costs has been underway for a number of years, but significant uncertainties remain. It is unclear to what extent we will be liable for environmental costs or natural resource damage claims or third party contribution or damage claims with respect to the Site.. While we participated in certain preliminary Site study efforts, we were not party to the consent order entered into by the EPA with certain other PRPs, referred to as the \"Lower Willamette Group\" (\"LWG\"), for a remedial investigation/feasibility study (\"RI/FS\"). During fiscal 2007, we and certain other parties agreed to an interim settlement with the LWG under which we made a cash contribution to the LWG RI/FS. The LWG has indicated that it had incurred over $115 million in investigation-related costs over an approximately ten year period working on the RI/FS. Following submittal of draft RI and FS documents which the EPA largely rejected, the EPA took over the RI/FS process.. 13 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2017. Table of Contents                     SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.. We have joined with approximately 100 other PRPs, including the LWG members, in a voluntary process to establish an allocation of costs at the Site, including the costs incurred by the LWG in the RI/FS process. The LWG members have also commenced federal court litigation, which has been stayed, seeking to bring additional parties into the allocation process.. In January 2008, the Natural Resource Damages Trustee Council (\"Trustees\") for Portland Harbor invited us and other PRPs to participate in funding and implementing the Natural Resource Injury Assessment for the Site. Following meetings among the Trustees and the PRPs, a funding and participation agreement was negotiated under which the participating PRPs agreed to fund the first phase of the natural resource damage assessment. We joined in that Phase I agreement and paid a portion of those costs. We did not participate in funding the second phase of the natural resource damage assessment.. A former Trustee, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, which withdrew from the council in 2009, filed a suit on January 30, 2017 against approximately 30 parties, including us, seeking reimbursement of certain past and future response costs in connection with remedial action at the Site and recovery of assessment costs related to natural resources damages from releases at and from the Site to the Multnomah Channel and the Lower Columbia River. We intend to defend against such claims and do not have sufficient information to determine the likelihood of a loss in this matter or to estimate the amount of damages being sought or the amount of such damages that could be allocated to us.. Estimates of the cost of remedial action for the cleanup of the in-river portion of the Site in various drafts of the FS and in the EPA's final FS issued in June 2016 have varied widely, from approximately $170 million to over $2.5 billion (net present value), depending on the remedy alternative and a number of other factors. In addition, we and certain other stakeholders have identified a number of serious concerns regarding the EPA's risk and remedial alternatives assessments and the EPA's cost estimates, scheduling assumptions and conclusions regarding the feasibility, effectiveness and assignment of remediation technologies, including that the EPA's FS was based on data that are more than a decade old and may not accurately represent site or background conditions.. In January 2017, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (\"ROD\") that identified the selected remedy for the Site. The selected remedy is a modified version of one of the alternative remedies in the EPA's FS that expands the scope of the cleanup and has an estimated cost which is significantly more than the Proposed Plan identified by the EPA in the final FS. The EPA has estimated the total cost of the selected remedy at $1.7 billion with a net present value cost of $1.05 billion (at a 7% discount rate) and an estimated construction period of 13 years following completion of the remedial designs. In the ROD, the EPA stated that the cost estimate is an order-of-magnitude engineering estimate that is expected to be within +50% to -30% of the actual project cost and that changes in the cost elements are likely to occur as a result of new information and data collected during the engineering design. We have identified a number of concerns regarding the EPA's estimated cost and time required for the selected remedy. Because of questions regarding cost-effectiveness and other concerns, such as technical feasibility, use of stale data and the need for new baseline data, it is uncertain whether the ROD will be implemented as issued. In addition, the ROD does not determine or allocate the responsibility for remediation costs.. In the ROD, the EPA acknowledged that the assumptions used to estimate costs for the selected remedy were developed based on the existing data and will be finalized during the remedial design, after design level data to refine the baseline conditions are obtained.  Moreover, the ROD provides only Site-wide cost estimates and does not provide sufficient detail or ranges of certainty and finality to estimate costs for specific sediment management areas. Accordingly, the EPA has indicated and we anticipate that additional pre-remedial design investigative work, such as new baseline sampling and monitoring, will be conducted in order to provide a re-baseline and delineate particular remedial actions for specific areas within the Site. This re-baselining will need to occur prior to proceeding with the next phase in the process which is the remedial design. The remedial design phase is an engineering phase during which additional technical information and data will be collected, identified and incorporated into technical drawings and specifications developed for the subsequent remedial action. The EPA is seeking a new coalition of PRPs to perform the re-baselining and remedial design activities. We are considering whether to become a party to a new Administrative Order on Consent to perform such pre-remedial design investigative activities, if an acceptable consent order can be finalized. We do not believe that our share of the costs of performing such work would be material, and we believe that such costs would be allocable and that they would be reimbursable under the insurance policies discussed below.. Remediation activities are not expected to commence for a number of years and responsibility for implementing and funding the remedy will be determined in a separate allocation process. While an allocation process is currently underway as discussed above, the EPA's ROD has raised questions and uncertainty as to when and how that allocation process will proceed. We would not expect the allocation process to proceed until after additional pre-remedial design data is collected.. Because there has not been a determination of the specific remediation actions that will be required, the amount of natural resource damages or how the costs of the investigations and any remedy and natural resource damages will be allocated among the PRPs, we believe it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount or range of costs which we are likely to or which it is reasonably possible that we will incur in connection with the Site, although such costs could be material to our financial position, results of. 14 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2017. Table of Contents                     SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.. operations, cash flows and liquidity. Among the facts currently being developed are detailed information on the history of ownership of and the nature of the uses of and activities and operations performed on each property within the Site, which are factors that will play a substantial role in determining the allocation of investigation and remedy costs among the PRPs. We have insurance policies that we believe will provide reimbursement for costs we incur for defense, remediation and mitigation for natural resource damages claims in connection with the Site, although there is no assurance that those policies will cover all of the costs which we may incur. Significant cash outflows in the future related to the Site could reduce the amount of our borrowing capacity that could otherwise be used for investment in capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. Any material liabilities incurred in the future related to the Site could result in our failure to maintain compliance with certain covenants in our debt agreements. See \"Contingencies  -  Environmental\" in Note 9  -  Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.. We operate in industries that are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. The timing and magnitude of the cycles in the industries in which our products are used, including global steel manufacturing and residential construction in the U.S., are difficult to predict. The cyclical nature of our operations tends to reflect and be amplified by changes in economic conditions, both domestically and internationally, and foreign currency exchange fluctuations. The impact of recent political events, such as the United Kingdom referendum to exit the European Union declared in June 2016, on global economic conditions is currently uncertain. Economic downturns or a prolonged period of slow growth in the U.S. and foreign markets or any of the industries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. Instability in international markets may adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. We generate a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to customers located outside the U.S. including countries in Asia, the Mediterranean region and North, Central and South America. Our ability to sell our products profitably, or at all, to international markets is subject to a number of risks including adverse impacts of political, military, terrorist or major pandemic events; local labor and social issues; legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments including quotas, tariffs or other protectionist trade barriers, adverse tax law changes, nationalization, currency restrictions, or import restrictions for certain types of products we export; and disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or government agencies.. For example, in fiscal 2017, regulators in China began implementing the National Sword initiative involving inspections of Chinese industrial enterprises, including recyclers, in order to identify rules violations with respect to discharge of pollutants or illegally transferred scrap imports. The scope of the National Sword initiative, which could include import bans on certain recycled products, is still being developed. Based on the most current information available, we believe that a potential impact on our recycling operations could include additional processing of certain nonferrous recycled scrap metal products prior to export to China. If necessary to address additional regulatory developments, we may assess the potential for further investments in nonferrous processing equipment where economically justified.. The occurrence of such events and conditions may adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.. Changes in the availability or price of raw materials and end-of-life vehicles could reduce our sales. Our businesses require certain materials that are sourced from third-party suppliers. Although the synergies from our integrated operations allow us to be our own source for some raw materials, particularly with respect to scrap metal for our steel manufacturing operations, we rely on other suppliers for most of our raw material needs, including inputs to steel production such as graphite electrodes and other required consumables. Industry supply conditions generally involve risks, including the possibility of shortages of raw materials, increases in raw material costs and reduced control over delivery schedules. We procure our scrap inventory from numerous sources. These suppliers generally are not bound by long-term contracts and have no obligation to sell scrap metal to us. In periods of declining or lower scrap metal prices, such as the declining price environment we experienced in fiscal 2015 and the first half of fiscal 2016, suppliers may elect to hold scrap metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their metal collection activities, tightening supply. If a substantial number of suppliers cease selling scrap metal to us, we will be unable to recycle metal at desired levels, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. A slowdown of industrial production in the U.S. may also reduce the supply of industrial grades of metal to the metals recycling industry, resulting in less recyclable metal available to process and market. Increased competition for domestic scrap metal, including as a result of overcapacity in the scrap recycling industry in the U.S. and Canada, may also reduce the supply of scrap metal available to us. Failure to obtain a steady supply of scrap material could both adversely impact our ability to meet sales commitments and reduce our operating margins. Failure to obtain an adequate supply of end-of-life vehicles could adversely impact our ability to attract customers and charge admission fees and reduce our parts sales. Failure to obtain raw materials and other inputs to steel production such as alloys, graphite electrodes and other required consumables, could adversely impact our ability to make steel to the specifications of our customers.. 15 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2017. Table of Contents                     SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.. Significant decreases in scrap metal prices may adversely impact our operating results. The timing and magnitude of the cycles in the industries in which we operate are difficult to predict and are influenced by different economic conditions in the domestic market, where we typically acquire our raw materials, and foreign markets, where we typically sell the majority of our products. Purchase prices for scrap metal including end-of-life vehicles and selling prices for recycled scrap metal are subject to market forces beyond our control. For instance, in fiscal 2015 and the first half of fiscal 2016, scrap metal prices experienced a significant downward trend caused primarily by the weak macroeconomic conditions and global steel-making overcapacity, which was further exacerbated by the impact of lower iron ore prices, a raw material used in steel-making in blast furnaces which compete with EAF steel-making production that uses ferrous scrap as its primary feedstock. While we attempt to respond to changing recycled scrap metal selling prices through adjustments to our metal purchase prices, our ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors. As a result, we may not be able to reduce our metal purchase prices to fully offset a sharp reduction in recycled scrap metal sales prices, which may adversely impact our operating income and cash flows. In fiscal 2015 and the first half of fiscal 2016, lower demand for recycled scrap metal relative to demand and competition for supply of unprocessed scrap metal in the domestic market compressed operating margins due to selling prices decreasing at a faster rate than purchase prices for unprocessed scrap metal. In addition, a rapid decrease in selling prices may compress our operating margins due to the impact of average inventory cost accounting, which causes cost of goods sold recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to decrease at a slower rate than metal purchase prices and net selling prices.. Imbalances in supply and demand conditions in the global steel industry may reduce demand for our products. Economic expansions and contractions in global economies can result in supply and demand imbalances in the global steel industry that can significantly affect the price of commodities used and sold by our business, as well as the price of and demand for finished steel products. In a number of foreign countries, such as China, steel producers are generally government-owned and may therefore make production decisions based on political or other factors that do not reflect free market conditions. In recent years, overcapacity and excess steel production in these foreign countries resulted in the export of aggressively priced semi-finished and finished steel products. This led to disruptions in steel-making operations within other countries, negatively impacting demand for our recycled scrap metal products used by EAF mills globally as their primary feedstock. Further, the import of foreign steel products into the U.S. at similarly aggressive prices adversely impacted finished steel sales prices and sales volumes at CSS. Existing trade laws and regulations may be inadequate to prevent disadvantageous trade practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although trade regulations restrict or impose duties on the importation of certain products, if foreign steel production significantly exceeds consumption in those countries, global demand for our recycled scrap metal products could decline and imports of steel products into the U.S. could increase, resulting in lower volumes and selling prices for our recycled metal products and finished steel products.. Goodwill impairment charges may adversely affect our operating results. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the net amount of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination measured at fair value. We have a substantial amount of goodwill on our balance sheet, all of which was carried by a single reporting unit within AMR as of August 31, 2017. We test the goodwill balance for impairment on an annual basis and when events occur or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit may be below its carrying amount. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may be required to measure the fair value of the reporting unit in order to determine the amount of impairment, if any. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to inherent uncertainties and changes in estimates and assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, tax rates, terminal growth rates, discount rates, benefits associated with a taxable transaction and synergistic benefits available to market participants. Declines in market conditions, a trend of weaker than anticipated financial performance for our single reporting unit with allocated goodwill, a decline in our share price  for a sustained period of time, or an increase in the market-based weighted average cost of capital, among other factors, are indicators that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable. We may be required to record a goodwill impairment charge that, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, management identified a triggering event requiring an interim impairment test of goodwill, which resulted in impairment of a reporting unit's goodwill totaling $141 million, and in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, management identified a triggering event requiring an interim impairment test of goodwill, which resulted in impairment of a different reporting unit's goodwill totaling $9 million. Both of these impairment charges are reported within the results of AMR in this report.. 16 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2017. Table of Contents                     SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.. Impairment of long-lived assets and cost and equity method investments may adversely affect our operating results. Our long-lived asset groups are subject to an impairment assessment when certain triggering events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows of the operations related to the asset group, an impairment is recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset group. The results of these tests for potential impairment may be adversely affected by unfavorable market conditions, our financial performance trends, or an increase in interest rates, among other factors. If as a result of the impairment test we determine that the fair value of any of our long-lived asset groups is less than its carrying amount, we may incur an impairment charge that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We recorded impairment charges on long-lived tangible and intangible assets associated with certain regional metals recycling operations and used auto parts store locations in the amount of $8 million and $44 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. With respect to our investments in unconsolidated entities accounted for under the cost and equity methods, a loss in value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized. Once we determine that an other-than-temporary impairment exists, we may incur an impairment charge that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We recorded impairment charges of $1 million and $2 million during fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to investments in joint ventures accounted for under the equity method. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further detail on long-lived asset and joint venture investment impairment charges.. Inability to sustain the benefits from productivity and restructuring initiatives may adversely impact our operating results. We have undertaken a number of productivity improvement and restructuring initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses and improve profitability and to achieve further integration and synergistic cost efficiencies in our operating platform. These initiatives included idling underutilized assets and closing facilities to more closely align our business to market conditions, implementing productivity initiatives to increase production efficiency and material recovery, and further reducing our annual operating expenses through headcount reductions, reducing organizational layers, consolidating shared service functions, savings from procurement activities, streamlining of administrative and supporting services functions, and other non-headcount measures. We incurred restructuring charges and other exit-related activities in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 as a result of these initiatives. Failure to sustain the expected cost reductions and other benefits related to these productivity and restructuring initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.. Acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses may result in operating difficulties and other unintended consequences. We may make acquisitions of complementary businesses to enable us to enhance our customer base and grow our revenues. Execution of any past or potential future acquisition involves a number of risks, including:. • Difficulty integrating the acquired businesses' personnel and operations;. • Potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired business;. • Difficulties in realizing anticipated cost savings, efficiencies and synergies;. • Unexpected costs;. • Inaccurate assessment of or undisclosed liabilities;. • Inability to maintain uniform standards, controls and procedures; and. • Difficulty in managing growth.. If we do not successfully execute on acquisitions and the acquired businesses do not perform as projected, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.. Changing economic conditions may result in customers not fulfilling their contractual obligations. We enter into export ferrous sales contracts preceded by negotiations that include fixing price, quantity, shipping terms and other contractual terms. Upon finalization of these terms and satisfactory completion of other contractual contingencies, the customer typically opens a letter of credit to satisfy its payment obligation under the contract prior to our shipment of the cargo. Although not considered normal course of business, in times of changing economic conditions, including during periods of sharply falling scrap metal prices such as those experienced in fiscal 2015 and the first half of fiscal 2016, there is an increased risk that customers may not be willing or able to fulfill their contractual obligations or open letters of credit. For example, in fiscal 2015, the resale or modification of the terms, each at significantly lower prices, of certain previously contracted bulk shipments had a $7 million negative impact on our operating results. As of August 31, 2017 and 2016, 33% and 34%, respectively, of our trade accounts receivable balance were covered by letters of credit.. 17 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2017. Table of Contents                     SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may reduce the demand for our products. A significant portion of our recycled scrap metal revenues is generated from sales to foreign customers, which are denominated in U.S. dollars, including customers located in Asia, Africa and Europe. A strengthening U.S. dollar, as experienced during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016, makes our products more expensive for non-U.S. customers, which may negatively impact export sales. A strengthening U.S. dollar also makes imported metal products less expensive, which may result in an increase in imports of steel products into the U.S. As a result, our finished steel products, which are made in the U.S., may become more expensive for our U.S. customers relative to imported steel products thereby reducing demand for our products.. We are exposed to translation and transaction risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates Hedging instruments may not be effective in mitigating such risks and may expose us to losses or limit our potential gains. Our operations in Canada expose us to translation and transaction risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the U.S. dollar, our reporting currency. As a result, we are subject to foreign currency exchange risks due to exchange rate movements in connection with the translation of the operating costs and the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations into our functional currency for inclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements.. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange transaction risk. As part of our risk management program, we may use financial instruments, including foreign currency exchange forward contracts. While intended to reduce the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, these instruments may not be effective in reducing all risks related to such fluctuations and may limit our potential gains or expose us to losses. Although we do not enter into these instruments for trading purposes or speculation, and our management believes all such instruments are entered into as hedges of underlying physical transactions, these instruments are dependent on timely performance by our counterparties. Should our counterparties to such instruments or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress or otherwise, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from the transactions covered by these instruments.. Potential limitations on our ability to access capital resources may restrict our ability to operate. Our operations are capital intensive. Our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. While we expect that our cash requirements, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service, dividends, share repurchases and investments, will be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our secured committed bank credit facilities, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Additional acquisitions could require financing from external sources. Although we believe we have adequate access to contractually committed borrowings, we could be adversely affected if our banks were unable to honor their contractual commitments or ceased lending. Failure to access our credit facilities could restrict our ability to fund operations, make capital expenditures or execute acquisitions.. The agreement governing our bank credit facility imposes certain restrictions on our business and contains financial covenants. Our secured bank credit facilities contain certain restrictions on our business which limit (subject to certain exceptions) our ability to, among other things, incur or suffer to exist certain liens, make investments, incur or guaranty additional indebtedness, enter into consolidations, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of assets, make distributions and other restricted payments, change the nature of our business, engage in transactions with affiliates and enter into restrictive agreements, including agreements that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business or execute our strategy and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. Our bank credit agreement also requires that we maintain certain financial and other covenants, including a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, a consolidated leverage ratio, and a consolidated asset coverage ratio. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or financial covenants could result in an event of default under the bank credit agreement, and permit our lenders to cease lending to us and declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. This could require us to refinance our bank facilities, which we may not be able to do at terms acceptable to us, or at all.. Consolidation in the steel industry may reduce demand for our products. There has been a significant amount of consolidation in the steel industry in recent years that has included steel mills acquiring steel fabricators to ensure demand for their products. If any of our steel mill's significant remaining customers were to be acquired by competing steel mills, this could reduce the demand for our products and force us to lower our prices, reducing our revenues, or to reduce production, which could increase our unit costs and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. 18 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2017. Table of Contents                     SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.. Failure to realize expected benefits from investments in processing and manufacturing technology may impact our operating results and cash flows. We make significant investments in processing and manufacturing technology improvements aimed at increasing the efficiency and capabilities of our businesses and to maximize our economies of scale. Failure to realize the anticipated benefits and generate adequate returns on such capital improvement projects may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.. Reliance on third party shipping companies may restrict our ability to ship our products. We generally rely on third parties to handle and transport raw materials to our production facilities and products to customers. Despite our practice of utilizing a diversified group of suppliers of transportation, factors beyond our control, including changes in fuel prices, political events, governmental regulation of transportation, changes in market rates, carrier availability, carrier bankruptcy, shipping industry consolidation and disruptions in transportation infrastructure, may adversely impact our ability to ship our products. These impacts could include delays or other disruptions in shipments in transit or third party shipping companies increasing their charges for transportation services or otherwise reducing or eliminating the availability of their vehicles or ships. As a result, we may not be able to transport our products in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and may harm our reputation.. Equipment upgrades, equipment failures and facility damage may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns. Our recycling and manufacturing processes depend on critical pieces of equipment, including shredders, nonferrous sorting technology, furnaces and a rolling mill, which may be out of service occasionally for scheduled upgrades or maintenance or as a result of unanticipated failures. Our facilities are subject to equipment failures and the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, earthquakes, accidents or violent weather conditions. For instance, our metals recycling operations in Puerto Rico were briefly interrupted in September 2017 as a result of Hurricane Maria, although the damages to and losses incurred by the operations were not material. We have insurance to cover certain of the risks associated with equipment damage and resulting business interruption, but there are certain events that would not be covered by insurance and there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available on acceptable terms. Interruptions in our processing and production capabilities and shutdowns resulting from unanticipated events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. Product liability claims may adversely impact our operating results. We could inadvertently acquire radioactive scrap metal that could potentially be included in mixed scrap metal shipped to consumers worldwide. Although we have invested in radiation detection equipment in the majority of our locations, including the facilities from which we ship directly to customers, failure to detect radioactive scrap metal remains a possibility. Even though we maintain insurance to address the risk of this failure in detection, there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage would be adequate or will continue to be available on acceptable terms. In addition, if we fail to meet contractual requirements for a product, we may be subject to product warranty costs and claims. These costs and claims could both have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and harm our reputation.. We are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks that may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with domestic and foreign regulations, contractual obligations and other legal standards. Notwithstanding this, we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks in respect of various matters, including regulatory, safety, environmental, employment, transportation, intellectual property, contractual, import/export, international trade and governmental matters that arise in the course of our business and in our industry. For example, legal proceedings can include those arising from accidents involving Company-owned vehicles, including Company tractor trailers. In some instances, such accidents and the related litigation involve accidents that have resulted in third party fatalities. A negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation in excess of insurance recoveries could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For information regarding our current significant legal proceedings, see \"Legal Proceedings\" in Part I, Item 3 of this report.. 19 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2017. Table of Contents                     SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.. Climate change may adversely impact our facilities and our ongoing operations. The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and depend upon the unique geographic and environmental factors present, for example rising sea levels at our deep water port facilities, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperature levels. As many of our recycling facilities are located near deep water ports, rising sea levels may disrupt our ability to receive scrap metal, process the scrap metal through our mega-shredders and ship products to our customers. Periods of extended adverse weather conditions may inhibit the supply of scrap metal to our recycling facilities, which could have an adverse effect on our sales or cause us to fail to meet our sales commitments. In addition, sustained periods of increased temperature levels in the summer in areas where our auto store operations are located could result in reduced customer traffic, thus resulting in lower admissions and parts sales.. We may not realize our deferred tax assets in the future. The assessment of recoverability of our deferred tax assets is based on an evaluation of existing positive and negative evidence as to whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized. If negative evidence outweighs positive evidence, a valuation allowance is required. Impairment of deferred tax assets may result from significant negative industry or economic trends, a decrease in earnings performance and projections of future taxable income, adverse changes in laws or regulations and a variety of other factors. Impairment of deferred tax assets could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition and could result in not realizing the deferred tax assets. In recent years, we have recorded significant valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, and our low annual effective tax rates in the fiscal years presented in this report are primarily the result of our full valuation allowance position. Deferred tax assets generated in future periods may require further valuation allowances if it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.. Tax increases and changes in tax rules may adversely affect our financial results. As a company conducting business on a global basis with physical operations throughout North America, we are exposed, both directly and indirectly, to the effects of changes in U.S., state, local and foreign tax rules. Taxes for financial reporting purposes and cash tax liabilities in the future may be adversely affected by changes in such tax rules. In many cases, such changes put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our major competitors, to the extent we are unable to pass the tax costs through to our customers.. One or more cybersecurity incidents may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and reputation. We face global cybersecurity risks and threats on a continual and ongoing basis. These risks and threats range from inadvertent release of sensitive information to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at us. Our operations involve use of multiple systems that process, store and transmit sensitive information about our customers, suppliers, employees, financial position, operating results and strategies. While we are not aware of any material cyber-attacks or breaches of our systems to date, we have and continue to implement measures to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks, but there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use our systems, compromise sensitive information, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt our operations. The occurrence of such events could negatively impact our reputation and our competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties, regulatory action, loss of business, potential liability and increased remediation costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. Risk Factors Relating to the Regulatory Environment. Environmental compliance costs and potential environmental liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We are subject to local, state and federal environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries relating to, among other matters:. • Waste disposal;. • Air emissions;. • Waste water and storm water management and treatment;. • Soil and groundwater contamination remediation;. • Global climate change;. • Discharge, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials; and. • Employee health and safety.. 20 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2017. Table of Contents                     SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.. We are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain operations. Violation of or failure to obtain permits or comply with these laws or regulations could result in our business being fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators or becoming subject to litigation by private parties. Future environmental compliance costs may increase because of new laws and regulations, changing interpretations and stricter enforcement of current laws and regulations by regulatory authorities, uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels, the future costs of pollution control technology and issues related to global climate change.. Our operations use, handle and generate hazardous substances. In addition, previous operations by others at facilities that we currently or formerly owned, operated or otherwise used may have caused contamination from hazardous substances. As a result, we are exposed to possible claims, including government fines and penalties, costs for investigation and clean-up activities, claims for natural resources damages and claims by third parties for personal injury and property damage, under environmental laws and regulations, especially for the remediation of waterways and soil or groundwater contamination. These laws can impose liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances even if the owner or operator was neither aware of nor responsible for the release of the hazardous substances. We have, in the past, been found not to be in compliance with certain of these laws and regulations, and have incurred liabilities, expenditures, fines and penalties associated with such violations. In addition, we have been notified that we are or may be a potentially responsible party for actual or possible investigation and cleanup costs from historical contamination at sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us or at other sites where we may have responsibility for such costs due to past disposal or other activities. Environmental compliance costs and potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See also the risk factor \"Potential costs related to the environmental cleanup of Portland Harbor may be material to our financial position and liquidity\" in this Item 1A.. Governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our licenses and permits, and we may be unable to renew facility leases, thus restricting our ability to operate. We conduct certain of our operations subject to licenses, permits and approvals from state and local governments. Governmental agencies often resist the establishment of certain types of facilities in their communities, including auto parts facilities. In addition, from time to time, both the U.S. and foreign governments impose regulations and restrictions on trade in the markets in which we operate. In some countries, governments can require us to apply for certificates or registration before allowing shipment of recycled metal to customers in those countries. There can be no assurance that future approvals, licenses and permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew the approvals, licenses and permits we currently hold. Failure to obtain these approvals could cause us to limit or discontinue operations in these locations or prevent us from developing or acquiring new facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. We lease a significant portion of our facilities, including the substantial majority of our auto parts facilities. Failure to renew these leases may impact our ability to continue operations within certain geographic areas, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. Compliance with existing and new greenhouse gas emission laws and regulations may adversely impact our operating results. Future legislation or increased regulation regarding climate change and GHG emissions could impose significant costs on our business and our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with laws and regulations concerning and limitations imposed on climate change and GHG emissions. The potential costs of allowances, taxes, fees, offsets or credits that may be part of \"cap and trade\" programs or similar future legislative or regulatory measures are still uncertain and the future of these programs or measures is unknown. Any adopted future climate change and GHG laws or regulations could negatively impact our ability (and that of our customers and suppliers) to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future laws or regulations becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition, operating performance or ability to compete. Furthermore, even without such laws or regulations, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by companies in the metals recycling and steel manufacturing industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our products. See \"Business - Environmental Matters\" in Part I, Item 1 of this report for further detail.. Risk Factors Relating to Our Employees. Reliance on employees subject to collective bargaining may restrict our ability to operate. Approximately 21% of our full-time employees are represented by unions under collective bargaining agreements, including substantially all of the manufacturing employees at our CSS steel manufacturing facility. As these agreements expire, we may not be able to negotiate extensions or replacements of such agreements on acceptable terms. Any failure to reach an agreement with one or more of our unions may result in strikes, lockouts or other labor actions, including work slowdowns or stoppages, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.. 21 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2017. Table of Contents                     SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.. The underfunded status of our multiemployer pension plans may cause us to increase our contributions to the plans. As discussed in Note 13  -  Employee Benefits in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, we contribute to the Steelworkers Western Independent Shops Pension Plan (\"WISPP\"), a multiemployer plan benefiting union employees of CSS. Because we have no current intention of withdrawing from the WISPP, we have not recognized a withdrawal liability in our consolidated financial statements. However, if such a liability were triggered, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, liquidity and cash flows. Our contributions to the WISPP could also increase as a result of a diminished contribution base due to the insolvency or withdrawal of other employers who currently contribute to it, the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liabilities, or other funding deficiencies, as we would need to fund the retirement obligations of these employers.. In 2004, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") approved a seven-year extension of the period over which the WISPP may amortize unfunded liabilities, conditioned upon maintenance of certain minimum funding levels. In 2014, the WISPP obtained relief from the specified funding requirements from the IRS, which requires that the WISPP meet a minimum funded percentage on each valuation date and achieve a funded percentage of 100% as of October 1, 2029. Based on the actuarial valuation for the WISPP as of October 1, 2016, the funded percentage (based on the ratio of the market value of assets to the accumulated benefits liability (present value of accrued benefits) using the valuation method prescribed by the IRS) was 76.4%, which satisfies the minimum funded percentage requirements of the IRS."
