[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. The following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. Before you buy our Common Stock or Common Stock Non-Voting, you should know that making such an investment involves risks, including the risks described below. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or are currently deemed to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations in the future. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected. In that case, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment.. Damage to our reputation or brand name, loss of brand relevance, increase in use of private label or other competitive brands by customers or consumers, or product quality or safety concerns could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.. We have many iconic brands with long-standing consumer recognition.  Our success depends on our ability to maintain our brand image for our existing products, extend our brands to new platforms, and expand our brand image with new product offerings.. We continually make efforts to maintain and improve relationships with our customers and consumers and to increase awareness and relevance of our brands through effective marketing and other measures. From time to time, our customers evaluate their mix of product offerings, and consumers have the option to purchase private label or other competitive products instead of our branded products. If a significant portion of our branded business was switched to private label or competitive products, it could have a material negative impact on our consumer segment.. Our reputation for manufacturing high-quality products is widely recognized. In order to safeguard that reputation, we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our products.  A serious breach of our quality assurance or quality control procedures, deterioration of our quality image, impairment of our customer or consumer relationships or failure to adequately protect the relevance of our brands may lead to litigation, customers purchasing from our competitors or consumers purchasing other brands or private label items that may or may not be manufactured by us, any of which could have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.. The food industry generally is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination, product tampering, product recall, import alerts and consumer product liability claims. For instance, we may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled, contaminated or damaged, and certain of our raw materials could be blocked from entering the country if they were subject to import alerts. We also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products could cause injury or illness, or that any of our products are mislabeled or fail to meet applicable legal requirements (even if the allegation is untrue). A product recall, import alert or an adverse result in any such litigation, or negative perceptions regarding food products and ingredients, could result in our having to pay fines or damages, incur additional costs or cause customers and consumers in our principal markets to lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients, any of which could  have a negative effect on our business or financial results and, depending upon the significance of the affected product, that negative effect could be material to our business or financial results. Negative publicity about these concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage customers and consumers from buying our products or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.. The rising popularity of social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination (whether or not accurate), and, as a result, negative, inaccurate, or misleading posts or comments on websites may generate adverse publicity that could damage our reputation or. brands.. Customer consolidation, and competitive, economic and other pressures facing our customers, may put pressure on our operating margins and profitability.. A number of our customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors, have consolidated in recent years and consolidation could continue. Such consolidation could present a challenge to margin growth and profitability in that it has produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories; resisting price increases; demanding lower pricing, increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products; and shifting shelf space currently used for our products to private label and other competitive products. The economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing, such as the emergence of new sales channels like e-commerce, and our customers' responses to those changes could impact our business. Our industrial segment may be impacted if the reputation or perception of the customers of our industrial segment declines. These factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.. The inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business.. We have a number of major customers, including two large customers that, in the aggregate, constituted approximately 22% of our consolidated sales in 2017. The loss of either of these large customers or a material negative change in our relationship with these large customers or other major customers could have an adverse effect on our business.. Disruption of our supply chain and issues regarding procurement of raw materials may negatively impact us.. Our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather, growing and harvesting conditions, market conditions, governmental actions and other factors beyond our control. The most significant raw materials used by us in our business are pepper, dairy products, garlic, vanilla, capsicums (red peppers and paprika), onion, wheat flour and rice. While future price movements of raw material costs are uncertain, we seek to mitigate the market price risk in a number of ways, including strategic raw material purchases, purchases of raw material for future delivery, customer price adjustments and cost savings from our CCI program. We generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk. To the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose, it has not been material to our business. Any actions we take in response to market price fluctuations may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in raw material prices. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future raw material price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.. In addition, we may have very little opportunity to mitigate the risk of availability of certain raw materials due to the effect of weather on crop yield, government actions, political unrest in producing countries, action or inaction by suppliers in response to laws and regulations, changes in agricultural programs and other factors beyond our control. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.. Political, socio-economic and cultural conditions, as well as disruptions caused by terrorist activities or otherwise, could also create additional risks for regulatory compliance. Although we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our imported products, we cannot provide assurance that such events will not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.. Our profitability may suffer as a result of competition in our markets.. The food industry is intensely competitive. Competition in our product categories is based on price, product innovation, product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. From time to time, we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures, which may adversely affect our profitability. Such pressures could reduce our ability to take appropriate remedial action to address commodity and other cost increases.. Laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.. Food products are extensively regulated in most of the countries in which we sell our products. We are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the growing, sourcing, manufacturing, storage, labeling, marketing,. advertising and distribution of food products, as well as laws and regulations relating to financial reporting requirements, the environment, competition, anti-corruption, privacy, relations with distributors and retailers, foreign supplier verification, the import and export of products and product ingredients, employment, health and safety, and trade practices. Enforcement of existing laws and regulations, changes in legal requirements, and/or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations, financial or otherwise, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.  Increased regulatory scrutiny of, and increased litigation involving, product claims and concerns regarding the attributes of food products and ingredients may increase compliance costs and create other obligations that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Governments may also impose requirements and restrictions that impact our business, such as labeling disclosures pertaining to ingredients. For example, \"Proposition 65, the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986,\" in California exposes all food companies to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in that state. If we were required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in locations where our products are sold in order to comply with Proposition 65, the sales of those products and other products of our company could suffer, not only in those locations but elsewhere. These factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.. Our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters, business interruptions or similar events.. We could have an interruption in our business, loss of inventory or data, or be rendered unable to accept and fulfill customer orders as a result of a natural disaster, catastrophic event, epidemic or computer system failure. Natural disasters could include an earthquake, fire, flood, tornado or severe storm. A catastrophic event could include a terrorist attack. An epidemic could affect our operations, major facilities or employees' and consumers' health. In addition, some of our inventory and production facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather; a major storm, heavy snowfall or other similar event could prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner. Production of certain of our products is concentrated in a single manufacturing site.. We cannot provide assurance that our disaster recovery plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue, and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing. In the event that a natural disaster, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time, or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner, our business, financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected.. We may not be able to successfully consummate and manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities which could have an impact on our results.. From time to time, we may acquire other businesses and, based on an evaluation of our business portfolio, divest existing businesses. These acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures may present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, increased expenses and raw material costs, assumption of unknown liabilities and indemnities, and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers. In addition, we may be required to incur asset impairment charges (including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets) in connection with acquired businesses which may reduce our profitability. If we are unable to consummate such transactions, or successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Additionally, joint ventures inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational, and/or compliance risks.. Our foreign and cross-border operations are subject to additional risks.. We operate our business and market our products internationally. In fiscal year 2017, 41% of our sales were generated in foreign countries. Our foreign operations are subject to additional risks, including fluctuations in currency values, foreign currency exchange controls, discriminatory fiscal policies, compliance with U.S. and foreign laws, enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and other economic or political uncertainties. Several countries within the European Union continue to experience sovereign debt and credit issues which causes more volatility in the economic environment throughout the European Union and the United Kingdom (U.K.). Additionally, international sales, together with finished goods and raw materials imported into the U.S., are subject to risks related to fundamental changes to tax laws as well as the imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other similar restrictions. All of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, which could adversely affect our profitability.. Fluctuations in foreign currency markets may negatively impact us.. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas: cash flows related to raw material purchases; the translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. dollars; the effects of foreign currency on loans between subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and on cash flows related to repatriation of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Primary exposures include the U.S. dollar versus the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Australian dollar, Mexican peso, Chinese renminbi, Indian rupee and Thai baht, as well as the Euro versus the British pound sterling, Australian dollar and Swiss franc. We routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate managing certain of these foreign currency risks. However, these contracts may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to a decline in operating results due to foreign currency exchange changes. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future exchange rate fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business, financial position or operating results.. The decision by British voters to exit the European Union may negatively impact our operations.. The June 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union (\"Brexit\") adversely impacted global markets and resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the British pound, as compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies. As the U.K. negotiates its exit from the European Union, volatility in exchange rates and in U.K. interest rates may continue. In the near term, a weaker British pound compared to the U.S. dollar during a reporting period causes local currency results of our U.K. operations to be translated into fewer U.S. dollars; a weaker British pound compared to other currencies increases the cost of goods imported into our U.K. operations and may decrease the profitability of our U.K. operations; and a higher U.K. interest rate may have a dampening effect on the U.K. economy. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on our U.K. operations will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations.. Increases in interest rates or changes in our credit ratings may negatively impact us.. We had total outstanding short-term borrowings of $258 million at an average interest rate of approximately 2.3% on November 30, 2017. We also had total outstanding variable rate long-term debt, including current maturities, of $1,243 million at an average interest rate of approximately 2.7% on November 30, 2017. The interest rates under our term loans and revolving credit facilities can vary based on our credit ratings. Our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements. We also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing cost and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk, including interest rate exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations. We do not enter into contracts for trading purposes, nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments. Our use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines. However, our use of these instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in interest rates. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future credit rating or interest rate changes will not have a material negative impact on our business, financial position or operating results.. Our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital.. Our credit ratings reflect each rating organization's opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations. Our credit ratings were downgraded following our financing of the acquisition of RB Foods in August 2017, and any reduction in our credit ratings may limit our ability to borrow at interest rates consistent with the interest rates that were available to us prior to that acquisition and the related financing transactions. If our credit ratings are further downgraded or put on watch for a potential downgrade, we may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in the amounts, at the times or interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if our current credit ratings were maintained.. We have incurred additional indebtedness to finance the acquisition of RB Foods and may not be able to meet our debt service requirements.. After financing our acquisition of RB Foods, we have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding. As of November 30, 2017, the indebtedness of McCormick and its subsidiaries is approximately $5.0 billion. This substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to:. • reducing the benefits that we expect to receive from the acquisition of RB Foods;. • increasing our debt service obligations, making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;. • limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing;. • increasing our exposure to negative fluctuations in interest rates;. • subjecting us to financial and other restrictive covenants, the non-compliance with which could result in an event of default;. • increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions;. • limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;. • placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged; and. • restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities, including other acquisitions.. The deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding.. We rely on our revolving credit facilities, or borrowings backed by these facilities, to fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate purposes. If any of the banks in the syndicates backing these facilities were unable to perform on its commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could adversely affect funding of seasonal working capital requirements. We engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our revolving credit facilities. During these communications, none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments. In addition, we periodically review our banking and financing relationships, considering the stability of the institutions, pricing we receive on services and other aspects of the relationships. Based on these communications and our monitoring activities, we believe the likelihood of one of our banks not performing on its commitment is remote.. In addition, global capital markets have experienced volatility in the past that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding, and such volatility and tightened access could reoccur in the future. In the event that we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period. Our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period could have an adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and liquidity.. We face risks associated with certain pension assets and obligations.. We hold investments in equity and debt securities in our qualified defined benefit pension plans and in a rabbi trust for our U.S. non-qualified pension plan. Deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn or otherwise, or an increase in the actuarial valuation of the plans' liability due to a low interest rate environment, could cause (or increase) an underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans, thereby increasing our obligation to make contributions to the plans. An obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses, and may have an adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and liquidity.. Uncertain global economic conditions expose us to credit risks from customers and counterparties.. Consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers, some of which are highly leveraged. In addition, competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels through our customer base. These factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk. Current credit markets are volatile, and some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged. A significant adverse change in the financial and/or credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables. This could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity.. Our operations and reputation may be impaired if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyber attack.. Our information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently. We rely on our information technology systems to manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.. Furthermore, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to security breaches beyond our control, including those involving cyber attacks using viruses, worms or other destructive software, process breakdowns, or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing. Such breaches could result in unauthorized access. to information including customer, consumer or other company confidential data. We invest in security technology and design our business processes to mitigate the risk of such breaches. While we believe that these measures are generally effective, there can be no assurance that security breaches will not occur. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures requires continuous monitoring as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures evolve. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cybersecurity threats and incidents, none of which has been material to us to date. However, a successful breach or attack could have a material, negative impact on our operations or business reputation and subject us to consequences such as litigation, regulatory enforcement proceedings and direct costs associated with incident response.. The global nature of our business and the resolution of tax disputes create volatility in our effective tax rate.. As a global business, our tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors, including changes in tax. legislation, our global mix of earnings, the tax characteristics of our income, the timing and recognition of goodwill. impairments, acquisitions and dispositions, adjustments to our reserves related to uncertain tax positions, changes in valuation allowances and the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the U.S. and that will be taxable.. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish accruals for certain tax contingencies when, despite the belief that our tax return positions are appropriately supported, the positions are uncertain. The tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law and emerging legislation. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals and changes to those accruals, including related interest and penalties, as considered appropriate by management. When particular matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. Unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.. Climate change may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Unseasonable or unusual weather or long-term climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of spices, herbs and other raw materials. There is concern that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity or practices, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products. In addition, such climate change may result in modifications to the eating preferences of the ultimate consumers of certain of our products, which may also unfavorably impact our sales and profitability.. Our intellectual property rights, and those of our customers, could be infringed, challenged or impaired, and reduce the value of our products and brands or our business with customers.. We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business, and we are provided access by certain customers to particular intellectual property rights belonging to such customers.  These intellectual property rights include ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets which are important to our business and relate to some of our products, our packaging, the processes for their production, and the design and operation of equipment used in our businesses. We protect our intellectual property rights, and those of certain customers, globally through a variety of means, including trademarks, copyrights, patents and trade secrets, third-party assignments and nondisclosure agreements, and monitoring of third-party misuses of intellectual property. If we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property (and the intellectual property of customers to which we have been given access), the value of our products and brands could be reduced and there could be an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Litigation, legal or administrative proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition or damage our reputation.. We are party to a variety of legal claims and proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Since litigation is inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings, or that management's assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection with such matters, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such claims or. proceedings. In the event that management's assessment of the materiality or immateriality of current claims and proceedings proves inaccurate, or litigation that is material arises in the future, there may be a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal or administrative proceedings (even if untrue) may also adversely affect our reputation. These factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition or damage our reputation.. Streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness may have a negative effect on employee relations.. We regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness, and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future. From time to time, those changes are of such significance that we may transfer production from one manufacturing facility to another; transfer certain selling and administrative functions from one location to another; eliminate certain manufacturing, selling and administrative positions; and exit certain businesses or lines of business. These actions may result in a deterioration of employee relations at the impacted locations or elsewhere in McCormick.. If we are unable to fully realize the benefits from our CCI program, our financial results could be negatively affected.. Our future success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry. Any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies under our CCI program, or other similar programs, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.. We have incurred significant transaction and integration expenses in connection with the acquisition of RB Foods that could adversely affect our results of operations.. We have incurred significant transaction expenses in connection with the RB Foods acquisition, including payment of certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and related financing transactions. We have also incurred significant integration expenses, and expect to continue to incur such expenses in 2018. Additional unanticipated expenses may be incurred in the integration process. These could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.. RB Foods may underperform relative to our expectations.. We may not be able to maintain the growth rate, levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that we and RB Foods have achieved prior to the completion of that acquisition or might have achieved separately. The business and financial performance of RB Foods are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. The underperformance of RB Foods relative to our expectations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits that we envisioned at the time of our acquisition of RB Foods or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating RB Foods.. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of RB Foods will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate RB Foods into the rest of our business, which is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. The nature of a carve-out acquisition, such as RB Foods, makes it inherently more difficult to assume operations upon closing of the acquisition and to integrate activities, as certain systems, processes and employees may not all be transferred with RB Foods to support such activities. As a result, we will be required to continue to devote significant management attention and resources to integrate the business practices and operations of McCormick and RB Foods. Future integration efforts may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits. The failure to meet the challenges involved in the integration process and to realize the anticipated benefits of the RB Foods acquisition could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our operations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. In addition, the further integration of RB Foods may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customers and other business relationships, and diversion of management's attention. Additional integration challenges include:. • difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the acquisition of RB Foods;. • difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;. • difficulties in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures;. • difficulties in the assimilation of employees;. • managing the potential impact of competing or duplicative products;. • difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;. • challenges in obtaining new customers;. • challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel; and. • the impact of potential liabilities we may be inheriting from RB Foods.. Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in us becoming subject to litigation. In addition, even if RB Foods is integrated successfully, the full anticipated benefits of its acquisition may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process. Each of these factors could cause reductions in our earnings per share, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and negatively impact the price of shares of our common stock. As a result, it cannot be assured that the acquisition of RB Foods will result in the realization of the full anticipated benefits.. We expect that, for a period of time following our acquisition of RB Foods on August 17, 2017, we will have significantly less cash on hand than prior to that date.. We expect to have, for a period of time following the August 17, 2017 acquisition of RB Foods, significantly less cash and cash equivalents on hand than the cash and cash equivalents that we had on hand prior to that date. Although we believe that we will have access to cash sufficient to meet our business objectives and capital needs, the lessened availability of cash and cash equivalents for a period of time following the acquisition of RB Foods could constrain our ability to grow our business. Our more leveraged financial position following the acquisition of RB Foods could also make us vulnerable to general economic downturns and industry conditions, and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have more cash at their disposal. In the event that we do not have adequate capital to maintain or develop our business, additional capital may not be available to us on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all.. The acquisition of RB Foods has significantly increased our goodwill and other intangible assets.. We have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated financial statements that are subject to impairment based upon future adverse changes in our business or prospects. The impairment of any goodwill and other intangible assets may have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations.. Curtailment of our share repurchase program may not enhance shareholder value.. We have curtailed the repurchases of our shares under our share repurchase program. Upon the acquisition of RB Foods, we announced our intention to reduce our leverage ratio by curtailing our share repurchase program, but there can be no assurance that curtailment of the program will result in the reduction of our leverage ratio. Our board of directors reserves the right to expand or terminate the share repurchase program at any time. Curtailment of the share repurchase program may not have the intended effects and may have a negative impact on our stock price.. The declaration, payment and amount of dividends is made at the discretion of our board of directors and depends on a number of factors.. The declaration, payment and amount of any dividends is made pursuant to our dividend policy and is subject to final determination each quarter by our board of directors in its discretion based on a number of factors that it deems relevant, including our financial position, results of operations, available cash resources, cash requirements and alternative uses of cash that our board of directors may conclude would be in the best interest of the company and our shareholders. Our dividend payments are subject to solvency conditions established by the Maryland General Corporation Law. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any future dividends will be equal or similar in amount to any dividends previously paid or that our board of directors will not decide to reduce, suspend or discontinue the payment of dividends at any time in the future."
