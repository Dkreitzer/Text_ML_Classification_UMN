[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. We are subject to uncertainties and risks due to the nature of the business activities we conduct.  The following information describes certain uncertainties and risks that could affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or expectations contained in our forward-looking statements on page 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section does not describe all risks applicable to us, our industry or our business, and it is intended only as a summary of known material risks that are specific to us.  We may experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We are in the process of developing LNG liquefaction and export projects, and the success of such projects is unpredictable; as such, positive cash flows and even revenues will be several years away, if they occur at all.. We are not expected to generate cash flow, or even obtain revenues, unless and until the Project is operational, which is expected to be at least five years away, and, accordingly, distributions to investors may be limited, delayed, or non-existent.. Our cash flow and consequently our ability to distribute earnings is solely dependent upon the revenues Rio Grande and Rio Bravo receive from the Project and the transfer of funds by Rio Grande and Rio Bravo to NextDecade in the form of distributions or otherwise. Rio Grande's and Rio Bravo's ability to complete the Project, as discussed further below, will be dependent upon, among other things, our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and raise the capital necessary to fund development of the Project.. Our ability to pay dividends is almost entirely dependent upon our ability to complete the Project and generate cash and net operating income from operations. We do not expect to generate any revenues until the completion of construction of the first phase of the Project. Upon such completion, financing and numerous other factors affecting the Project may reduce our cash flow. As a result, we may not make distributions of any amount or any distributions may be delayed.. Substantially all of our anticipated revenue will be dependent upon the Project. Due to our lack of asset diversification, adverse developments at or affecting the Project would have a significantly greater impact on our financial condition and results of operations than if we maintained a more diverse portfolio of assets.. We will be required to seek additional debt and equity financing in the future to complete the Project and may not be able to secure such financing on acceptable terms, or at all.. Since we will be unable to generate any revenue from our operations and expect to be in the development or construction stage for multiple years, we will need additional financing to provide the capital required to execute our business plan. We will need significant funding to develop and construct the Project as well as for working capital requirements and other operating and general corporate purposes.. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient capital on acceptable terms, or at all. If sufficient capital is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate the development of business opportunities, and our operations and financial condition may be adversely affected to a significant extent.. Debt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include liens on Project assets and covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as paying dividends or making distributions, incurring additional debt, acquiring or disposing of assets and increasing expenses. Debt financing would also be required to be repaid regardless of our operating results.. In addition, the ability to obtain financing for the Project is expected to be contingent upon, among other things, our ability to enter into sufficient long-term commercial agreements prior to the commencement of construction. For additional information regarding our ability to enter into sufficient long-term commercial agreements, see \" -  Our ability to generate cash is substantially dependent upon it entering into satisfactory contracts with third parties and the performance of those third parties under those contracts.\". 9. Table of Contents. We may be subject to risks related to doing business in, and having counterparties based in, foreign countries.. We may engage in operations or make substantial commitments to and investments in, and enter into agreements with, counterparties located outside the U.S., which would expose us to political, governmental, and economic instability and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.. Any disruption caused by these factors could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects. Risks associated with potential operations, commitments and investments outside of the U.S. include but are not limited to risks of:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcurrency exchange restrictions and currency fluctuations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twar or terrorist attack;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpropriation or nationalization of assets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trenegotiation or nullification of existing contracts or international trade arrangements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanging political conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmacro-economic conditions impacting key markets and sources of supply;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanging laws and policies affecting trade, taxation, financial regulation, immigration, and investment;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tduplicative taxation by different governments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral hazards associated with the assertion of sovereignty over areas in which operations are conducted, transactions occur, or counterparties are located; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe unexpected credit rating downgrade of countries in which our LNG customers are based.. As our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, any operations conducted outside the U.S. or transactions denominated in foreign currencies would face additional risks of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. In addition, we would be subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and exchange rate changes on our financial reports when translating our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses from operations or transactions outside of the U.S. into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. These translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period.. Our estimated costs for the Project may not be accurate and are subject to change due to various factors.. Our construction cost estimates are only an approximation of the actual costs of construction and are before owners' costs, financing costs, pipeline construction costs and contingencies. Moreover, cost estimates may change due to various factors, such as economic and market conditions, government policy, claims and litigation risk, competition, the final terms of any definitive request for services with our EPC service provider, as well as change orders, delays in construction, legal and regulatory requirements, site issues, increased component and material costs, escalation of labor costs, labor disputes, increased spending to maintain our construction schedule and other factors. In particular, our estimated costs for the Project are expected to be substantially affected by:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tglobal prices of nickel, steel, concrete, pipe, aluminum and other component parts of the Project and the contractual terms upon which our contractors are able to source and procure required materials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany U.S. import tariffs on steel, aluminum, pipe or other component parts of the Project, which may raise the prices of certain materials used in the Project;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcommodity and consumer prices (principally, natural gas, crude oil and fuels that compete with them in our target markets) on which our economic assumptions are based;. 10. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar with other currencies since a portion of the Terminal EPC price will be denominated in foreign currencies and subject to adjustment between contract execution and the time that a full notice to proceed is issued;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in regulatory regimes in the U.S. and the countries to which we will be authorized to sell LNG;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlevels of competition in the U.S. and worldwide;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the tax regimes in the countries to which we sell LNG or in which we operate;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcost inflation relating to the personnel, materials and equipment used in our operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelays caused by events of force majeure or unforeseeable climatic events;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinterest rates; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsynergy benefits associated with the development of multiple phases of the Project using identical design and construction philosophies.. Cost estimates may change, and actual costs of construction may vary from current cost estimates, due to various factors, such as the final terms of any LSTK contract into which we enter with CB&I, as well as any change orders, delays in construction, unanticipated regulatory delays, increased material or staffing costs, or other factors.. In addition to our actual willingness to take FID, and our ability to construct the Project and achieve operations, events related to such activities may cause actual costs of the Project to vary from the range, combination and timing of assumptions used for the projected costs of the Project, such variations may be material and adverse, and an investor may lose all or a portion of its investment.. The construction and operation of the Project remains subject to further governmental approvals, and some approvals may be subject to further conditions, review and/or revocation.. We will be required to obtain governmental approvals and authorizations to implement our proposed business strategy, which includes the design, construction and operation of the Project and the export of LNG from the U.S. to foreign countries. The design, construction and operation of LNG export terminals is a highly regulated activity. The approval of the FERC under Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act, as well as several other material governmental and regulatory approvals and permits, is required in order to construct and operate an LNG terminal. An equivalent approval under Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act is required to construct and operate the Pipeline. There is no guarantee that such approvals can be obtained. Although the necessary authorizations to construct and operate the Project may be obtained, such authorizations are subject to ongoing conditions imposed by regulatory agencies, and additional approval and permit requirements may be imposed.. Substantially all of our revenue will be generated from exports of LNG from the U.S. to foreign countries. Under Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act authorization of the DOE is required to export LNG from the U.S. We have obtained such authorization for export to countries with which the U.S. has a Free Trade Agreement (\"FTA\"), but many of our target markets are not FTA countries. We have applied to the DOE for approval to export LNG to non-FTA countries. There is no assurance that we will obtain or, if obtained, maintain these governmental authorizations, approvals and permits. Failure to obtain, failure to obtain on a timely basis, or failure to maintain any of these governmental authorizations, approvals and permits could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.. For example, some of these governmental authorizations, approvals and permits require extensive environmental review. Some groups have perceived, and other groups could perceive the proposed construction and operation of the Project as negatively impacting the environment or cultural heritage sites. Objections from such groups could cause delays, damage to reputation and difficulties in obtaining governmental authorizations, approvals or permits, or prevent the obtaining of such authorizations, approvals or permits altogether.. 11. Table of Contents. We will be dependent on third-party contractors for the successful completion of the Project, and these contractors may be unable to complete the Project or may build a non-conforming Project.. The construction of the Project is expected to take several years, will be confined to a limited geographic area and could be subject to delays, cost overruns, labor disputes and other factors that could adversely affect financial performance or impair our ability to execute our scheduled business plan.. Timely and cost-effective completion of the Project in conformity with agreed-upon specifications will be highly dependent upon the performance of third-party contractors pursuant to their agreements. However, we have not yet entered into definitive agreements with certain of the contractors, advisors and consultants necessary for the development and construction of the Project. We may not be able to successfully enter into such construction contracts on terms or at prices that are acceptable to it.. Further, faulty construction that does not conform to our design and quality standards may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. For example, improper equipment installation may lead to a shortened life of our equipment, increased operations and maintenance costs or a reduced availability or production capacity of the affected facility. The ability of our third-party contractors to perform successfully under any agreements to be entered into is dependent on a number of factors, including force majeure events and such contractors' ability to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdesign, engineer and receive critical components and equipment necessary for the Project to operate in accordance with specifications and address any start-up and operational issues that may arise in connection with the commencement of commercial operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tattract, develop and retain skilled personnel and engage and retain third-party subcontractors, and address any labor issues that may arise;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpost required construction bonds and comply with the terms thereof, and maintain their own financial condition, including adequate working capital;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadhere to any warranties the contractors provide in their EPC contracts; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trespond to difficulties such as equipment failure, delivery delays, schedule changes and failure to perform by subcontractors, some of which are beyond their control, and manage the construction process generally, including engaging and retaining third-party contractors, coordinating with other contractors and regulatory agencies and dealing with inclement weather conditions.. Furthermore, we may have disagreements with our third-party contractors about different elements of the construction process, which could lead to the assertion of rights and remedies under the related contracts, resulting in a contractor's unwillingness to perform further work on the relevant project. We may also face difficulties in commissioning a newly constructed facility. Any of the foregoing issues or significant project delays in the development or construction of the Project could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. We plan to enter into a LSTK EPC contract, which could mitigate certain of these design, construction, and execution risks through performance, time and cost guarantees. We expect to execute the EPC contract in the second quarter of 2018.. Our ability to generate cash is substantially dependent upon it entering into satisfactory contracts with third parties and the performance of those third parties under those contracts.. We have not yet entered into, and may never be able to enter into, satisfactory commercial arrangements with third-party suppliers of feedstock or other required supplies to the Project, or customers for products and services from the Project.. Our business strategy regarding how and when the Project's export capacity or LNG produced by the Terminal is marketed may change based on market factors. Without limitation, our business strategy may change due to inability to enter into agreements with customers or based on our or market participants' views regarding future supply and demand of LNG, prices, available worldwide natural gas liquefaction capacity or regasification capacity, or other factors. If efforts. 12. Table of Contents. to market the Project's export capacity or LNG produced by the Terminal are not successful, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.. Rio Grande's construction and operations activities are subject to a number of development risks, operational hazards, regulatory approvals and other risks which may not be fully covered by insurance, and which could cause cost overruns and delays that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.. Siting, development and construction of the Project will be subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any construction project resulting from numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties or delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, sufficient debt or equity financing on reasonable terms;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure to obtain all necessary government and third-party permits, approvals and licenses for the construction and operation of any of the proposed LNG facilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure to obtain sale and purchase agreements that generate sufficient revenue to support the financing and construction of the Project;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties in engaging qualified contractors necessary to the construction of the contemplated Project or other LNG facilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshortages of equipment, material or skilled labor;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnatural disasters and catastrophes, such as hurricanes, explosions, fires, floods, industrial accidents and terrorism;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twork stoppages and labor disputes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompetition with other domestic and international LNG export terminals;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunanticipated changes in domestic and international market demand for and supply of natural gas and LNG, which will depend in part on supplies of and prices for alternative energy sources and the discovery of new sources of natural resources;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunexpected or unanticipated additional improvements; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse general economic conditions.. Delays beyond the estimated development periods, as well as cost overruns, could increase the cost of completion beyond the amounts that are currently estimated, which could require us to obtain additional sources of financing to fund the activities until the Project is constructed and operational (which could cause further delays). The need for more financing may also make the Project uneconomic. Any delay in completion of the Project may also cause a delay in the receipt of revenues projected from the Project or cause a loss of one or more customers. As a result, any significant construction delay, whatever the cause, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.. Our operations are subject to all of the hazards inherent in the receipt and processing of natural gas to LNG, and associated short-term storage including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdamage to pipelines and plants, related equipment, loading terminal, and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires and other natural disasters, acts of terrorism and acts of third parties;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdamage from subsurface and/or waterway activity (for example, sedimentation of shipping channel access);. 13. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tleaks of natural gas, natural gas liquids, or oil or losses of natural gas, natural gas liquid, or oil as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfires, ruptures and explosions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and suspension of operations; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thazards experienced by other operators that may affect our operations by instigating increased regulations and oversight.. Any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial loss to us as a result of claims for:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinjury or loss of life;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdamage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpollution and other environmental damage;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory investigations and penalties;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuspension of our operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure to perform contractual obligations; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trepair and remediation costs.. We may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, contractual liabilities and pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We may experience increased labor costs, and the unavailability of skilled workers or our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect us.  In addition, changes in our senior management or other key personnel could affect our business operations.. We are dependent upon the available labor pool of skilled employees authorized to work in the United States. We compete with other energy companies and other employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience required to construct and operate our facilities and pipelines and to provide our customers with the highest quality service. A shortage in the labor pool of skilled workers able to legally work in the United States or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and could require an increase in the wage and benefits packages that we offer, thereby increasing our operating costs. Any increase in our operating costs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.. We depend on our executive officers for various activities. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our personnel.  Although we have arrangements relating to compensation and benefits with certain of our executive officers, we do not have any employment contracts or other agreements with key personnel binding them to provide services for any particular term. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business.. 14. Table of Contents. Technological innovation, competition or other factors may negatively impact our anticipated competitive advantage or our processes.. Our success will depend on our ability to create and maintain a competitive position in the natural gas liquefaction industry. We do not have any exclusive rights to any of the technologies that we will be utilizing. In addition, the technology we anticipate using in the Project may face competition due to the technological advances of other companies or solutions, including more efficient and cost-effective processes or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors or others, which could affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.. Factors that may negatively affect potential demand for LNG from the Project are diverse and include, among others:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreases in worldwide LNG production capacity and availability of LNG for market supply;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdecreases in demand for LNG or increases in demand for LNG, but at levels below those required to maintain current price equilibrium with respect to supply;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreases in the cost of natural gas feedstock supplied to any project;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdecreases in the cost of, and competition with, sources of alternate fuels (such as coal, oil, nuclear power and hydroelectric, wind and solar energy);.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisplacement of LNG by pipeline natural gas or alternate fuels in locations where access to these energy sources is not currently available;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical instability in foreign countries that import natural gas, or strained relations between such countries and the U.S.; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teconomic or other reasons for LNG buyers to obtain their LNG from non-U.S. markets or from competitors' LNG facilities in the United States.. Decreases in the global demand for and price of natural gas (versus the price of imported LNG) could lead to reduced development of LNG projects worldwide.. We are subject to risks associated with the development, operation and financing of domestic LNG facilities. The development of domestic LNG facilities and projects is generally based on assumptions about the future price of natural gas and LNG and the conditions of the global natural gas and LNG markets. Natural gas and LNG prices have been, and are likely to remain in the future, volatile and subject to wide fluctuations that are difficult to predict. As a result, our activities will expose us to risks of commodity price movements, which we believe could be mitigated by entering into long-term LNG sales contracts.  There can be no assurance that we will be successful in entering into long-term LNG sales contracts.  Additionally,  the global LNG market could shift toward the use of shorter-term LNG sales contracts.. Fluctuations in commodity prices may create a mismatch between natural gas and petroleum prices, which could have a significant impact on our future revenues. Commodity prices and volumes are volatile due to many factors over which we have no control, including competing liquefaction capacity in North America; the international supply and receiving capacity of LNG; LNG marine transportation capacity; weather conditions affecting production or transportation of LNG from the Terminal; domestic and global demand for natural gas; the effect of government regulation on the production, transportation and sale of natural gas; oil and natural gas exploration and production activities; and the development of and changes in the cost of alternative energy sources for natural gas and political and economic conditions worldwide.. Our activities are also dependent on the price and availability of materials for the construction of the Project, such as nickel, aluminum, pipe, and steel, which may be subject to import tariffs in the U.S. market and are all also subject to factors affecting commodity prices and volumes. In addition, authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale power rates in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere, as well as independent system operators overseeing some of these markets, may impose. 15. Table of Contents. price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms which may adversely impact or otherwise limit trading margins and lead to diminished opportunities for gain. We cannot predict the impact energy trading may have on our business, results of operations or financial condition.. Further, the development of liquefaction facilities takes a substantial amount of time, requires significant capital investment, may be delayed by unforeseen and uncontrollable factors and is dependent on our financial viability and ability to market LNG internationally.. Competition in the LNG industry is intense, and some of our competitors have greater financial, technological and other resources.. We plan to operate in the highly competitive area of LNG production and face intense competition from independent, technology-driven companies as well as from both major and other independent oil and natural gas companies and utilities.. Many competing companies have secured access to, or are pursuing development or acquisition of, LNG facilities in North America. We may face competition from major energy companies and others in pursuing our proposed business strategy to provide liquefaction and export products and services at the Project. In addition, competitors have and are developing LNG terminals in other markets, which will compete with U.S. LNG facilities. Some of these competitors have longer operating histories, more development experience, greater name recognition, larger staffs and substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we currently possess. The superior resources that some of these competitors have available for deployment could allow them to compete successfully against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.. There may be shortages of LNG vessels worldwide, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.. The construction and delivery of LNG vessels requires significant capital and long construction lead times, and the availability of the vessels could be delayed to the detriment of our business and customers due to the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tan inadequate number of shipyards constructing LNG vessels and a backlog of orders at these shipyards;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical or economic disturbances in the countries where the vessels are being constructed;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in governmental regulations or maritime self-regulatory organizations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twork stoppages or other labor disturbances at the shipyards;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbankruptcies or other financial crises of shipbuilders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tquality or engineering problems;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tweather interference or catastrophic events, such as a major earthquake, tsunami, or fire; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshortages of or delays in the receipt of necessary construction materials.. Terrorist attacks, including cyberterrorism, or military campaigns involving us or the Project could result in delays in, or cancellation of, construction or closure of the Project.. A terrorist or military incident involving the Project may result in delays in, or cancellation of, construction of the Project, which would increase our costs and prevent us from obtaining expected cash flows. A terrorist incident could also result in temporary or permanent closure of the Project, which could increase costs and decrease cash flows, depending on the duration of the closure. Operations at the Project could also become subject to increased governmental scrutiny that may result in additional security measures at a significant incremental cost. In addition, the threat of terrorism and the impact of military campaigns may lead to continued volatility in prices for natural gas that could adversely affect our business and customers, including the ability of our suppliers or customers to satisfy their respective obligations under our. 16. Table of Contents. commercial agreements. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, including cyberterrorism, or war could also materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital. The continuation of these developments may subject our construction and operations to increased risks, as well as increased costs, and, depending on their ultimate magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.. Changes in legislation and regulations relating to the LNG industry could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.. Future legislation and regulations, such as those relating to the transportation and security of LNG exported from the proposed LNG facilities, could cause additional expenditures, restrictions and delays in connection with the proposed LNG facilities and their construction, the extent of which cannot be predicted, and which may require us to substantially limit, delay or cease operations in some circumstances. Revised, reinterpreted or additional laws and regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating costs and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.. Our operations will be subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs, and existing and future environmental and similar laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions.. Our business will be subject to extensive federal, state and local regulations and laws, including regulations and restrictions on discharges and releases to the air, land and water and the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes in connection with the development, construction and operation of our liquefaction facilities. These regulations and laws will require us to maintain permits, provide governmental authorities with access to our facilities for inspection and provide reports related to our compliance.  Violation of these laws and regulations could lead to substantial fines and penalties or to capital expenditures related to pollution control equipment that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects. Federal and state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the lawfulness of the original conduct, for the release of certain types or quantities of hazardous substances into the environment. As the owner and operator of the Project, we could be liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous substances released into the environment and for damage to natural resources.. In addition, future federal, state and local legislation and regulations may impose unforeseen burdens and increased costs on our business that could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, such as regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions and the transportation of LNG. As an international shipper of LNG, our operations could also be impacted by environmental laws applicable under international treaties or foreign jurisdictions.. The operation of the Project may be subject to significant operating hazards and uninsured risks, one or more of which may create significant liabilities and losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects.. The plan of operations for the Project is subject to the inherent risks associated with LNG operations, including explosions, pollution, release of toxic substances, fires, hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions, and other hazards, each of which could result in significant delays in commencement or interruptions of operations and/or result in damage to or destruction of the Project and assets or damage to persons and property.. We do not, nor do we intend to, maintain insurance against all these risks and losses. We may not be able to maintain desired or required insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.. We are dependent on a limited number of customers for the purchase of LNG.. The number of potential customers is limited. Some potential purchasers of the LNG to be produced from the Terminal are new to the LNG business and have limited experience in the industry. We will be reliant upon the ability for these customers to enter into satisfactory downstream arrangements in their home markets for the licenses to import and re-sell re-gasified LNG. Some of these jurisdictions are heavily regulated and dominated by state entities. In certain instances, customers may require credit enhancement measures in order to satisfy project-financing requirements.. 17. Table of Contents. We have not yet concluded negotiations for the Terminal site lease and have obtained right-of-way options for only part of the Pipeline route.. Our strategy currently involves leasing or otherwise acquiring suitable sites for the construction of new facilities to transport gas to the Terminal and to produce large quantities of LNG for delivery under tolling arrangements or sale. For the siting of the Terminal, we have entered into a site option agreement for a 984-acre tract of land owned by the Brownsville Navigation District which operates the Port of Brownsville along the Brownsville Ship Channel. Our option is valid until November 2019. If we are unable to timely complete the lease negotiations or extend the lease option, we may not be able to site the Terminal and our business will be materially adversely affected.. We have commenced work on securing options for rights-of-way along the approximately 137-mile Pipeline route. This involves direct negotiations with more than 125 landowners along the route, some of whom may not be familiar with oil and gas developments or negotiate terms in good faith. It is possible that as we progress these negotiations, we may encounter recalcitrant land-owners or competitive projects offering more attractive terms which could result in additional time and cost in order to secure the Pipeline route. Although the Pipeline is being permitted under Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, which provides permit holders rights of eminent domain, any recourse to eminent domain proceedings will increase the time and cost at which these rights-of-way will be secured. If the time or cost required to obtain these rights-of-way increases substantially or we are unable to obtain the rights-of-way, our business could be materially adversely affected.. Our U.S. competitors have acquired significant property tax incentives, and we may not be able to acquire or may not have acquired similar incentives from applicable taxing entities.. Due to the size of the Project's capital investment, property taxes represent large operating costs for the Project. The principal taxing entities are the Point Isabel Independent School District (\"PIISD\") and Cameron County (the \"County\"). Due to local opposition supported by national environmental interest groups, PIISD did not initially accept Rio Grande's application for a value limitation agreement pursuant to the State of Texas tax code provisions for economic development. We intend to resubmit Rio Grande's application for consideration, but there is no guaranty that it will be accepted and approved.  Approval of these tax incentives is an important component of the Project's competitiveness. Failure to gain approval of tax incentives by PIISD on comparable terms with competitors could materially impact the Project's competitiveness.. On October 3, 2017, Rio Grande executed four tax abatement agreements with the County; however, there is no assurance that the terms of such tax abatement agreements are competitive with other Gulf Coast liquefaction projects.. Objections from local communities can delay the Project.. Some local communities could perceive the proposed construction and operation of the Project as negatively impacting the environment, wildlife, cultural heritage sites or the public health of residents. Objections from local communities could cause delays, damage to reputation and difficulties in obtaining or renewing permits.. The Project will be dependent on the availability of gas supply at the Agua Dulce Hub.. The Pipeline will collect and transport natural gas to the Terminal. The Pipeline route passes through Jim Wells, Kleberg, Kenedy, Willacy, and Cameron Counties in Texas. The header system at the upstream end of the Pipeline is intended to have multiple interconnects to the existing natural gas pipeline grid located in the Agua Dulce market area (the \"Agua Dulce Hub\"). The Agua Dulce Hub is located in Nueces County, Texas, and includes deliveries from (but not limited to) ConocoPhillip's 1,100-mile South Texas intrastate and gas gathering pipeline system and ExxonMobil's 925 MMcf/d King Ranch processing facility. As the Pipeline system interconnects are expected to be relatively close to the Agua Dulce Hub, it is expected that gas will be available for purchase in large volumes at commercially acceptable prices. Nonetheless, disruptions in upstream supply sources or increased market demand could impact the availability of gas supply to the Pipeline header system, which would result in curtailments at the Terminal.. Each liquefaction train for the Terminal is expected to involve the transportation and liquefaction of approximately 0.75 Bcf/day of natural gas (for a total of 4.5 Bcf/day for six liquefaction trains at full build-out). Gas sales agreements for the supply of these volumes could entail negotiations with multiple parties for firm and interruptible gas supply and transportation services to the Pipeline header system, as well as pipeline interconnects and ancillary operational. 18. Table of Contents. agreements in time for operational start-up as early as 2023. Delays caused by third parties in the course of negotiating agreements and constructing the required interconnects could delay the start of commercial operations for the Project.. Unethical conduct and non-compliance with applicable laws could have a significant adverse effect on our business.. Incidents of unethical behavior, fraudulent activity, corruption or non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations could be damaging to our operations and reputation and may subject us to criminal and civil penalties or loss of operating licenses. We have implemented an anti-corruption policy which applies to all employees and contractors without exception and we are a member of TRACE International, an internationally recognized anti-bribery compliance provider. Our legal team screens potential partners, agents and advisors in multiple data-bases to which it has access and regularly conducts due diligence interviews with potential counterparties. Due to the global nature of the LNG business and the diversity of jurisdictions in which our customers operate, it is possible that a prospective counterparty could be accused of behavior that falls short of our expectations in this regard, leading to reputational damage and potential legal liabilities, notwithstanding our best efforts to prevent such behaviors.. Our common stock could be delisted from Nasdaq.. Our common stock is currently listed on Nasdaq. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq. If we fail to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq, our common stock may become subject to delisting. If Nasdaq delists our common stock from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the continued listing standards, we and our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences including:.  \t\t\ta limited availability of market quotations for our securities;.  \t\t\ta limited amount of analyst coverage; and.  \t\t\ta decreased ability for us to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future.  Holders of common stock could lose all or part of their investment.. The securities markets in general and our common stock has experienced significant price and volume volatility. The market price and trading volume of our common stock may continue to experience significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations or business prospects or those of companies in our industry. In addition to the other risk factors discussed above, the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdomestic and worldwide supply of and demand for natural gas and corresponding fluctuations in the price of natural gas;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in our quarterly or annual financial results or those of other companies in our industry;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tissuance of additional equity securities which causes further dilution to stockholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsales of a high volume of shares of our common stock by our stockholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toperating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tevents affecting other companies that the market deems comparable to us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in government regulation or proposals applicable to us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactual or potential non-performance by any customer or a counterparty under any agreement;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements made by us or our competitors of significant contracts;. 19. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral conditions in the industries in which we operate;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic conditions; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock or changes in financial or other estimates by analysts.. The stock prices of companies in the LNG industry have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation often has been initiated against a company. If any class action litigation is initiated against us, we may incur substantial costs and our management's attention may be diverted from our operations, which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights. Additionally, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other securities in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.. We may seek the additional capital necessary to fund our operations through public or private equity offerings and debt financings. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, existing stockholders' ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect their rights as a stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. In addition, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other securities in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.. Warrants are exercisable for our common stock, which, if exercised, would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders.. As of December 31, 2017, outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 12,081,895 shares of our common stock became exercisable in accordance with the terms of the warrant agreement governing those securities. These warrants will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York time, on July 24, 2022 or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The exercise price of these warrants is $11.50 per one full share, subject to certain adjustments. To the extent such warrants are exercised, additional shares of our common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the holders of our common stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market or the fact that such warrants may be exercised could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.. Our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation grants our board of directors the power to designate and issue additional shares of common and/or preferred stock.. Our authorized capital consists of 480,000,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Our preferred stock may be designated into series pursuant to authority granted by our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \"Certificate of Incorporation\"), and on approval from our board of directors. The board of directors, without any action by our stockholders, may designate and issue shares in such classes or series as it deems appropriate and establish the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares, including dividends, liquidation and voting rights. The rights of holders of other classes or series of stock that may be issued could be superior to the rights of holders of our common stock. The designation and issuance of shares of capital stock having preferential rights could adversely affect other rights appurtenant to shares of our common stock.. Provisions of our charter documents or Delaware law could delay or prevent an acquisition of NextDecade even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and could make it more difficult to change management.. Provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders might otherwise consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may. 20. Table of Contents. frustrate or prevent any attempt by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimitations on our stockholders' ability to call special meetings of stockholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tan advance notice requirement for stockholder proposals and nominations for members of our board of directors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe authority of our board of directors to determine the number of director seats on our board of directors; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe authority of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as it may determine.. U.S. federal income tax reform could adversely affect us.. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"2017 Tax Act\") was signed into law, significantly reforming the IRC. The 2017 Tax Act, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, reduces or eliminates certain domestic deductions and imposes limitations on the use of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate results in a decreased valuation of our deferred tax asset and liabilities. We continue to examine the impact the 2017 Tax Act may have on our business. The estimated impact of the 2017 Tax Act is based on our management's current knowledge and assumptions and recognized impacts could be materially different from current estimates based on our actual results.. 21.
