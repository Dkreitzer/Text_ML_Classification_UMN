[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors.. Prices of oil and natural gas fluctuate, and changes in prices could reduce proceeds to the Trust and cash distributions to Trust unitholders.. The Trust's reserves and monthly cash distributions are highly dependent upon the prices realized from the sale of oil and natural gas. Prices of oil and natural gas can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors that are beyond the control of the Trust and PCEC. These factors include, among others:.                   regional, domestic and foreign supply and perceptions of supply of oil and natural gas;.                   the level of demand and perceptions of demand for oil and natural gas;.                   political conditions or hostilities in oil and natural gas producing countries;.                   anticipated future prices of oil and natural gas and other commodities;.                   weather conditions and seasonal trends;.                   technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply;.                   U.S. and worldwide economic conditions;.                   the price and availability of alternative fuels;.                   the proximity, capacity, cost and availability of gathering and transportation facilities;.                   the volatility and uncertainty of regional pricing differentials;.                   governmental regulations and taxation;.                   energy conservation and environmental measures;.                   level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including by commodity price speculators; and.                   acts of force majeure.. In 2017, Brent oil prices ranged from $43.98 per Bbl to $66.80 per Bbl. In 2016, Brent oil prices ranged from $26.01 per Bbl to $54.96 per Bbl. In 2017, Henry Hub natural gas prices ranged from $2.44 per MMBtu to $3.80 per MMBtu. In 2016, Henry Hub natural gas prices ranged from $1.49 per MMBtu to $3.80 per MMBtu. Profits to which the Trust is entitled are especially sensitive to oil prices, because oil is a high percentage of production from the Underlying Properties. In 2017, oil represented 98% of production from the Underlying Properties.  Lower average realized prices have affected the Trust's cash distributions to unitholders.  For example, for the periods from February 2016 through February 2017, no cash distributions were made as Trust expenses exceeded the proceeds received from the Conveyed Interests.. Changes in the prices of oil and natural gas may reduce profits to which the Trust is entitled and may ultimately reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that is economic to produce from the Underlying Properties. As a result, PCEC or any third-party operator could determine during periods of low commodity prices to shut in or curtail production from wells on the Underlying Properties. In addition, PCEC or any third-party operator could determine during periods of low commodity prices to plug and abandon marginal wells that otherwise may have been allowed to continue to produce for a longer period under conditions of higher prices. Specifically, PCEC or any third-party operator may abandon any well or property if it reasonably believes that the well or property can no longer produce oil or natural gas in commercially paying quantities. This could result in termination of any Conveyed Interest relating to the abandoned well or property.. 18. Table of Contents. The Underlying Properties are sensitive to decreasing commodity prices. The commodity price sensitivity is due to a variety of factors that vary from well to well, including the costs associated with water handling and disposal, chemicals, surface equipment maintenance, downhole casing repairs and reservoir pressure maintenance activities that are necessary to maintain production. As a result, a decrease in commodity prices may cause the expenses of certain wells to exceed the well's revenue. If this scenario were to occur, PCEC or any third-party operator may decide to shut-in the well or plug and abandon the well. This scenario could reduce future cash distributions to Trust unitholders. In addition, PCEC is also sensitive to increasing natural gas prices at its Orcutt properties, where it consumes natural gas in connection with its production of oil. Accordingly, at times when PCEC is a net buyer of natural gas, increases in the price of natural gas may reduce proceeds from production from PCEC's Orcutt Diatomite properties and could reduce future cash distributions to Trust unitholders.. Actual reserves and future production may be less than engineers' estimates, which could reduce cash distributions by the Trust and the value of the Trust Units.. The value of the Trust Units and the amount of future cash distributions to the Trust unitholders depends upon, among other things, the accuracy of the reserves and future production estimated to be attributable to the Trust's interest in the Underlying Properties as summarized in the reports the Trust obtains from its independent petroleum engineers. It is not possible to measure underground accumulations of oil and natural gas in an exact way, and estimating reserves is inherently uncertain. Ultimately, actual production and revenues for the Underlying Properties could vary both positively and negatively and in material amounts from estimates. Furthermore, direct operating expenses and development expenses relating to the Underlying Properties could be substantially higher than current estimates. Petroleum engineers are required to make subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas based on factors and assumptions that include:.                   historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas;.                   oil and natural gas prices, production levels, Btu content, production expenses, transportation costs, severance and excise taxes and development expenses; and.                   the assumed effect of expected governmental regulation and future tax rates.. Changes in these assumptions and amounts of actual direct operating expenses and development expenses could materially decrease reserve estimates. In addition, the quantities of recovered reserves attributable to the Underlying Properties may decrease in the future as a result of future decreases in the price of oil or natural gas.. Developing oil and natural gas wells and producing oil and natural gas are costly and high-risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect future production from the Underlying Properties. For example, the ultimate development of future production will require additional permits. Any delays, reductions, lack of permits or cancellations in development and producing activities could decrease revenues that are available for distribution to Trust unitholders.. The process of developing oil and natural gas wells and producing oil and natural gas on the Underlying Properties is subject to numerous risks beyond the Trust's or PCEC's control, including risks that could delay PCEC's or other third-party operators' current drilling or production schedule and the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production.. PCEC is not obligated to undertake any development activities, and, as a result, any drilling or completion activities will be subject to the reasonable discretion of PCEC. PCEC's plan to increase production in the Orcutt Diatomite and West Pico properties beyond the currently permitted wells will require additional permits and approvals from various state and local agencies. Such permits may not be issued in a timely manner or at all. Additionally, the ability of PCEC or any third-party operator to carry out operations or to finance planned development expenses could be materially and adversely affected by any factor that may curtail, delay, reduce or cancel development and production, including:.                   delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements, including permitting;.                   unusual or unexpected geological formations;.                   shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel;.                   lack of available gathering facilities or delays in construction of gathering facilities;.                   lack of available capacity on interconnecting transmission pipelines;. 19. Table of Contents.                   equipment malfunctions, failures or accidents;.                   unexpected operational events and drilling conditions;.                   reductions in oil or natural gas prices;.                   market limitations for oil or natural gas;.                   pipe or cement failures;.                   casing collapses;.                   lost or damaged drilling and service tools;.                   loss of drilling fluid circulation;.                   uncontrollable flows of oil and natural gas, insert gas, water or drilling fluids;.                   fires and natural disasters;.                   environmental hazards, such as oil and natural gas leaks, pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases;.                   adverse weather conditions; and.                   oil or natural gas property title problems.. If planned operations, including drilling of development wells, are delayed or cancelled, or existing wells or development wells have lower than anticipated production due to one or more of the factors above or for any other reason, distributions to Trust unitholders may be reduced. Further, if PCEC or any third-party operator incurs increased costs due to one or more of the above factors or for any other reason and is not able to recover such costs from insurance, distributions to Trust unitholders may be reduced.. The Trust is passive in nature and neither the Trust nor the Trust unitholders have any ability to influence PCEC or control the operations or development of the Underlying Properties.. The Trust Units are a passive investment that entitle the Trust unitholder only to receive cash distributions from the Conveyed Interests and commodity derivative contracts. Trust unitholders have no voting rights with respect to PCEC and, therefore, have no managerial, contractual or other ability to influence PCEC's activities or the operations of the Underlying Properties. PCEC operated approximately 99% of the average daily production from the Underlying Properties located at Orcutt and West Pico for the year ended December 31, 2017 and is generally responsible for making all decisions relating to drilling activities, sale of production, compliance with regulatory requirements and other matters that affect such properties. Accordingly, PCEC may take actions that are in its own interest that may be different from the interests of the Trust.. Shortages of equipment, services and qualified personnel could increase costs of developing and operating the Underlying Properties and result in a reduction in the amount of cash available for distribution to the Trust unitholders.. The demand for qualified and experienced personnel to conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages. Historically, there have been shortages of drilling rigs and other equipment as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled. These factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel. Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. Shortages of field personnel and equipment or price increases could hinder the ability of PCEC or any third-party operator to conduct the operations which it currently has planned for the Underlying Properties, which would reduce the amount of cash received by the Trust and available for distribution to the Trust unitholders.. 20. Table of Contents. PCEC may transfer all or a portion of the Underlying Properties at any time without Trust unitholder consent.. PCEC may at any time transfer all or part of the Underlying Properties, subject to and burdened by the applicable Conveyed Interests, and may abandon individual wells or properties reasonably believed to be uneconomic. Trust unitholders are not entitled to vote on any transfer or abandonment of the Underlying Properties, and the Trust will not receive any profits from any such transfer. Following any sale or transfer of any of the Underlying Properties, the applicable Net Profits Interest and if applicable, the Royalty Interest, will continue to burden the transferred property and net profits and royalties attributable to such transferred property will be calculated for such transferred property on a standalone basis using the computation of net profits and royalties set forth in the Conveyance related to the Conveyed Interests. PCEC may delegate to the transferee responsibility for all of PCEC's obligations relating to the applicable Conveyed Interests on the portion of the Underlying Properties transferred.. PCEC may, without the consent of the Trust unitholders, require the Trust to release the Conveyed Interests associated with any property that accounts for less than or equal to 0.25% of the total production from the Underlying Properties in the prior twelve months and provided that the Conveyed Interests covered by such releases cannot exceed, during any twelve-month period, an aggregate fair market value to the Trust of $500,000. These releases will be made only in connection with a sale by PCEC of the relevant Underlying Properties and are conditioned upon an amount equal to the fair market value (net of sales costs) of such Conveyed Interests being treated as an offset amount against costs and expenses.. PCEC may enter into farm-out, operating, participation and other similar agreements to develop the property without the consent or approval of the Trustee or any Trust unitholder.. The reserves attributable to the Underlying Properties are depleting assets and production from those reserves will diminish over time. Furthermore, the Trust is precluded from acquiring other oil and natural gas properties, NPI or royalty interests to replace the depleting assets and production. Therefore, proceeds to the Trust and cash distributions to Trust unitholders will decrease over time.. The net profits and royalties payable to the Trust attributable to the Conveyed Interests are derived from the sale of production of oil and natural gas from the Underlying Properties. The reserves attributable to the Underlying Properties are depleting assets, which means that the reserves and the quantity of oil and natural gas produced from the Underlying Properties will decline over time.. Future maintenance projects on the Underlying Properties may affect the quantity of proved reserves that can be economically produced from wells on the Underlying Properties. The timing and size of these projects will depend on, among other factors, the market prices of oil and natural gas. Furthermore, with respect to properties for which PCEC is not designated as the operator, PCEC has limited control over the timing or amount of those development expenses. PCEC also has the right to non-consent and not participate in the development expenses on properties for which it is not the operator, in which case PCEC and the Trust will not receive the production resulting from such development expenses until after payout occurs pursuant to the applicable joint operating agreements. If PCEC or any third-party operator does not implement maintenance projects when warranted, the future rate of production decline of proved reserves may be higher than the rate currently expected by PCEC or estimated in the reserve reports.. The Trust Agreement provides that the Trust's activities are limited to owning the Conveyed Interests and any activity reasonably related to such ownership, including activities required or permitted by the terms of the Conveyance related to the Conveyed Interests. As a result, the Trust is not permitted to acquire other oil and natural gas properties, NPI or royalties to replace the depleting assets and production attributable to the Conveyed Interests.. Because the net profits and royalties payable to the Trust are derived from the sale of depleting assets, the portion of the distributions to Trust unitholders attributable to depletion may be considered to have the effect of a return of capital as opposed to a return on investment. Eventually, the Underlying Properties burdened by the Conveyed Interests may cease to produce in commercially paying quantities and the Trust may, therefore, cease to receive any distributions of net profits and royalties therefrom.. A change in oil price differentials may adversely impact the cash distributions available to Trust unitholders.. PCEC's oil production is sold in the local markets where the pricing is based on local or regional supply and demand factors. The difference between the benchmark price and the price PCEC receives is called a differential. PCEC cannot predict how the differential applicable to its production will change in the future, and it is possible that the differentials will change and the prices received for PCEC's oil production may decrease. Numerous factors may influence local pricing, such as refinery capacity, pipeline capacity and specifications, upsets in the midstream or downstream sectors of the industry, trade restrictions and governmental regulations. Changes in the differential between common benchmark prices for oil and the wellhead price PCEC receives could adversely impact the cash distributions available to Trust unitholders.. 21. Table of Contents. The amount of cash available for distribution by the Trust is reduced by the amount of any costs and expenses related to the Underlying Properties and other costs and expenses incurred by the Trust.. The Trust indirectly bears an 80% share of all costs and expenses related to the production from the Developed Properties and a 25% share of all costs and expenses related to the production from the Remaining Properties. These costs and expenses include direct operating expenses and development expenses, which reduce the amount of cash received by the Trust and thereafter distributable to Trust unitholders. Accordingly, higher costs and expenses related to the Underlying Properties will directly decrease the amount of cash received by the Trust in respect of a Net Profits Interest. Historical costs may not be indicative of future costs. For example, PCEC may in the future propose additional drilling projects that significantly increase the capital expenditures associated with the Underlying Properties, which could reduce cash available for distribution by the Trust. In addition, cash available for distribution by the Trust is further reduced by the Trust's general and administrative expenses and by the annual PCEC operating and services fee, which is currently $1.1 million, and is adjusted each April 1 based on changes in the Consumer Price Index.. Net profits payable to the Trust depend upon production quantities, sales prices of oil and natural gas and costs to develop and produce the oil and natural gas. Royalty Interest Proceeds depend on the Trust's share of production and property taxes and post-production costs, if any. If at any time cumulative costs for the Developed Properties or the Remaining Properties exceed cumulative gross proceeds associated with such properties, neither the Trust nor the Trust unitholders would be liable for the excess costs, but the Trust would not receive any net profits from the Developed Properties or the Remaining Properties, as the case may be, until cumulative gross proceeds for such properties exceed the cumulative total excess costs for such properties.. The bankruptcy of PCEC or any third-party operator could impede the operation of wells and the development of proved undeveloped reserves.. The value of the Conveyed Interests and the Trust's ultimate cash available for distribution is highly dependent on PCEC's financial condition. Neither PCEC nor any of the other operators of the Underlying Properties has agreed with the Trust to maintain a certain net worth or to be restricted by other similar covenants.. The ability to develop and operate the Underlying Properties depends on PCEC's future financial condition and economic performance and access to capital, which in turn will depend upon the supply and demand for oil and natural gas, prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of PCEC. PCEC is not a reporting company and is not required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. Therefore, neither the Trust unitholders nor the Trustee have access to financial information about PCEC.. For its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, PCEC had $3.5 million of cash on its balance sheet and zero debt. PCEC has access to a credit facility with a maturity of December 31, 2019. If PCEC has borrowings on its credit facility at December 31, 2019, or otherwise has indebtedness or other liabilities or obligations and is unable to extend the maturity of its credit facility or access alternative capital sources, PCEC may file for bankruptcy. PCEC has open commodity derivative contracts with its credit facility lender and if PCEC's credit facility is not extended, under the terms of the commodity derivative contract agreements, PCEC's credit facility lender is able to force a liquidation of the commodity derivative contracts.. In the event of the bankruptcy of PCEC or any third-party operator of the Underlying Properties, the working interest owners in the affected properties, creditors or the debtor-in-possession could have to seek a new party to perform the development and the operations of the affected wells. PCEC or the other working interest owners may not be able to find a replacement driller or operator, and they may not be able to enter into a new agreement with such replacement party on favorable terms within a reasonable period of time. As a result, such a bankruptcy may result in reduced production of reserves and decreased distributions to Trust unitholders.. On May 15, 2016, Breitburn Energy Partners LP and affiliated debtors, including Breitburn Operating LP (collectively, \"Breitburn\"), filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.  Breitburn is the operator for the East Coyote and Sawtelle properties and has continued to operate these properties during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings. As of the date of this Annual Report, Breitburn has not emerged from bankruptcy.. In the event of the bankruptcy of PCEC, if a court held that the NPI were part of the bankruptcy estate, the Trust may be treated as an unsecured creditor with respect to the Net Profits Interest.. PCEC and the Trust believe that the Net Profits Interest would be treated as an interest in real property under the laws of the State of California. While no California case has defined the nature of a \"net profits interest,\" the California Supreme Court has held that an overriding royalty interest in an oil and natural gas lease (such as the Royalty Interest) is an interest in real property. The California Supreme Court has also explained that the nature of the interest created depends upon the intention of the parties involved.. 22. Table of Contents. Given that the Net Profits Interest is defined in the Conveyance as an overriding royalty interest payable on the basis of net profits and the Conveyance states that it is the express intent of the parties that the Net Profits Interest constitutes, for all purposes, an interest in real property, it is likely that a California court would hold that the Net Profits Interest is an interest in real property. Nevertheless, the outcome is not certain because there is no dispositive California Supreme Court case directly concluding that a conveyance of a \"net profits interest\" constitutes the conveyance of a real property interest. As such, in a bankruptcy of PCEC, the Net Profits Interest might be considered an asset of the bankruptcy estate and used to satisfy obligations to creditors of PCEC, in which case the Trust would be an unsecured creditor of PCEC at risk of losing the entire value of the Net Profits Interest to senior creditors.. The generation of profits and royalties for distribution by the Trust depends in part on access to and operation of gathering, transportation and processing facilities. Any limitation in the availability of those facilities could interfere with sales of oil and natural gas production from the Underlying Properties.. The marketability of PCEC's oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering, transportation and processing facilities owned by third parties. In general, PCEC does not control these third-party facilities and its access to them may be limited or denied due to circumstances beyond its control. A significant disruption in the availability of these facilities could adversely impact PCEC's ability to deliver to market the oil and natural gas it produces and thereby cause a significant interruption in PCEC's operations. In some cases, PCEC's ability to deliver to market its oil and natural gas is dependent upon coordination among third parties who own the transportation and processing facilities it uses, and any inability or unwillingness of those parties to coordinate efficiently could also interrupt PCEC's operations. These are risks for which PCEC generally does not maintain insurance.. The facilities at PCEC's West Pico, East Coyote and Sawtelle properties are located in urban settings. The available means for alternative transportation of production from these properties are limited, due to the difficulties of building transportation systems in these areas as well as permitting restrictions pertaining to trucking. In addition, PCEC's Orcutt properties are currently serviced by a single gathering system, and there are a limited number of other transportation alternatives in the area. A change in PCEC's current takeaway arrangements, in the absence of satisfactory alternatives, would have an adverse effect on PCEC's operations. PCEC would be similarly affected if any of the other transportation, gathering and processing facilities it uses became unavailable or unable to provide services.. Phillips 66 purchases virtually all of PCEC's production, and a decision by Phillips 66 to discontinue or reduce its purchases of PCEC's production may adversely impact the cash distributions available to Trust unitholders.. In 2017, Phillips 66 accounted for 95% of PCEC's net sales. As a result, a decision by Phillips 66 to discontinue or reduce its purchases of PCEC's production may adversely impact the cash distributions available to Trust unitholders.. The Trustee must sell the Conveyed Interests and dissolve the Trust prior to the expected termination of the Trust if the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding Trust Units approve the sale or vote to dissolve the Trust or if the. annual cash proceeds received by the Trust attributable to the Conveyed Interests, in the aggregate, are. less than $2.0 million for each of any two consecutive years. As a result, Trust unitholders may not recover their investment.. The Trustee must sell the Conveyed Interests and dissolve the Trust if the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding Trust Units approve the sale or vote to dissolve the Trust. The Trustee must also sell the Conveyed Interests and dissolve the Trust if the annual cash proceeds received by the Trust attributable to the Conveyed Interests, in the aggregate, are less than $2.0 million for each of any two consecutive years.  If this occurs, the Trust Agreement requires the Trustee to sell the Conveyed Interests and to distribute the net proceeds to the Trust unitholders after paying all liabilities of the Trust and setting up cash reserves in such amounts as the Trustee in its discretion deems appropriate for contingent liabilities.  As a result, Trust unitholders may not recover their investment.. Current regulations and recent regulatory changes in California have and may continue to negatively impact PCEC's production in its Diatomite properties.. Recent regulatory changes in California have impacted PCEC's Diatomite production. For instance, in 2010, Diatomite production decreased significantly due to the inability to drill new wells pending the receipt of permits from the California Department of Conservation, Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources, or \"DOGGR.\" The current approval, among other things, includes stringent operating, response and preventative requirements relating to mechanical integrity testing and responses to integrity issues and surface expressions, among others. Compliance with these requirements and delays in regulatory reviews, as well as other regulatory action and inaction, has in the past and may in the future negatively impact the pace of drilling and steam injection and may impact development from PCEC's Diatomite properties in the near term.. 23. Table of Contents. PCEC previously had submitted permit applications relating to the drilling of an additional 96 steam injection wells on certain oil and natural gas properties located onshore in California in the Diatomite zone at Orcutt (the \"Orcutt Hill Resource Enhancement Plan\" or \"OHREP\").  At a hearing in June 2016, the Santa Barbara County Planning Commission (the \"Planning Commission\") instructed its staff to prepare Findings for Denial, which the Planning Commission adopted by a 3-2 vote in July 2016. In July 2016, PCEC filed an appeal to the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors, which heard the appeal in November 2016 and voted 3-2 to deny the project, with the exception of approving permanent permits for the installation of seep cans on PCEC's Orcutt Hill property.  As a result of the Board of Supervisors' decision, future cash flows associated with new permits for drilling in the Diatomite Zone at Orcutt, all of which would be attributable to Remaining Properties, is uncertain.  As of the date of this Annual Report, PCEC has not filed any additional permits for drilling in the Diatomite Zone at Orcutt and is not able to provide an estimate for when PCEC will submit such permits to Santa Barbara County. If submitted in the future, there can be no assurance that Santa Barbara County will approve such permits or that PCEC will be able to generate additional cash flows as a result.. The Orcutt Field also has experienced both seeps and surface expressions. Seeps of oil from a zone that is very near the surface and actually outcrops onto the surface have occurred in parts of the Orcutt Field over long periods of time pre-dating oil production and have occurred during periods of recent production. The seeps do not originate from the zone into which steam is being injected. Rather they originate from an overlying, near-surface zone. When seeps occur, they are contained and monitored.  If necessary, a simple canister is placed in the ground to contain any ongoing seepage. PCEC, in consultation with DOGGR, modified its injection practices in order to balance the amount of fluids injected and withdrawn into the Diatomite zone. Since this modification was made, the number of seeps has declined and four, three, zero and zero seep cans have been installed in 2015, 2016, 2017 and to date in 2018, respectively. The permitting of these seeps was part of the OHREP permitting process and was approved by the County. In the permit approval are conditions that, in order to comply, add additional expense including habitat restoration costs for habitat impacted in installation of seep cans, additional inspection and reporting costs and other costs that increase the expenses associated with operating the Orcutt Diatomite.  Surface expressions are situations where steam intended to be injected into the Diatomite oil-bearing zone instead leaks from the well and reaches the surface. In 2011, two wells in the field developed casing leaks that allowed steam to reach the surface and these wells remain out of service. In 2014, two different wells allowed steam to reach the surface, which resulted in the curtailment of steaming operations in several wells to allow the conduct of investigations, which remain ongoing under the supervision of DOGGR. DOGGR may impose additional operational restrictions or requirements, including requiring that wells be shut in, as a result of incidents involving surface expressions. PCEC is allowed to produce from the Diatomite zone at its Orcutt Newlove property pursuant to a Project Approval Letter (\"PAL\"). This PAL is subject to change or revocation by DOGGR at its sole discretion.. The State of California, through DOGGR, administers the federal Safe Drinking Water Act with respect to underground injection of fluids in conjunction with oil field activities. The EPA is requiring DOGGR to review all of the injection wells in California to determine whether or not the appropriate standards were met to permit injection into the zones currently allowed. DOGGR is in the process of establishing a process, in conjunction with other California state agencies and with the approval of the EPA, to review the current injection practices and, in essence, re-permit injection into appropriate injection zones. DOGGR has issued a preliminary list of more than 2,000 permits/wells which it is reexamining. Although none of PCEC's injection wells have been ordered shut by DOGGR, if new regulatory initiatives are implemented that restrict or prohibit the use of underground injection wells in areas where we rely upon the use of such wells in our operations, our costs to operate may significantly increase and our ability to continue production may be delayed or limited, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operation and financial position.. The Trust Units may lose value as a result of title deficiencies with respect to the Underlying Properties.. The existence of a material title deficiency with respect to the Underlying Properties could reduce the value of a property or render it worthless, thus adversely affecting the Conveyed Interests and the distributions to Trust unitholders. PCEC does not obtain title insurance covering mineral leaseholds, and PCEC's failure to cure any title defects may cause PCEC to lose its rights to production from the Underlying Properties. In the event of any such material title problem, profits available for distribution to Trust unitholders and the value of the Trust Units may be reduced.. The trading price for the Trust Units may not reflect the value of the Conveyed Interests held by the Trust, which would adversely affect the return on an investment in the units.. The trading price for publicly traded securities similar to the Trust Units tends to be tied to recent and expected levels of cash distributions. The amounts available for distribution by the Trust will vary in response to numerous factors outside the control of the Trust, including prevailing prices for sales of oil and natural gas production from the Underlying Properties and the timing and amount of direct operating expenses and development expenses. Consequently, the market price for the Trust Units may not necessarily be indicative of the value that the Trust would realize if it sold the Conveyed Interests to a third-party buyer. In addition, such market price may not necessarily reflect that the assets of the Trust are depleting assets, and that therefore a portion of each cash distribution paid with respect to the Trust Units should be considered by investors as a return of capital, with the remainder being considered as a return on investment. As a result, distributions made to a Trust unitholder over the life of these depleting assets may be less than the purchase price paid by the Trust unitholder.. 24. Table of Contents. If we do not meet the NYSE's continued listing requirements, the NYSE may delist the Trust Units, which could affect the market price, trading volume, liquidity and resale price of the Trust Units.. Under the NYSE's continued listing requirements, a company will be considered to be out of compliance with the NYSE's minimum price requirement if the company's average closing price over a consecutive 30 trading day period (the \"Average Closing Price\") is less than $1.00 (the \"Minimum Price Requirement\"). Under NYSE rules, a company that is out of compliance with the minimum price requirement has a cure period of six months to regain compliance if it notifies the NYSE within 10 business days of receiving a deficiency notice of its intention to cure the deficiency. During the cure period, the company's shares would continue to trade on the NYSE, subject to compliance with other continued listing requirements. A company may regain compliance if on the last trading day of any calendar month during the cure period the company has a closing share price of at least $1.00 and an average closing share price of at least $1.00 over the 30-trading-day period ending on the last trading day of that month. In the event that at the expiration of the cure period, both a $1.00 closing share price on the last trading day of the cure period and a $1.00 average closing share price over the 30-trading-day period ending on the last trading day of the cure period are not attained, the NYSE will commence suspension and delisting procedures.. The Trust was not in compliance with the Minimum Price Requirement for a brief period beginning in late February 2016. On April 1, 2016, the NYSE notified the Trust that it had regained compliance after the closing price of the Trust's units on March 31, 2016 and the average closing price of the Trust's units for the 30 days of trading that ended on March 31, 2016 were both at least $1.00. As of the close of business on December 31, 2017, the Average Closing Price of the Trust Units was $1.94. Although the Trust Units have been trading at or above $2.00 per unit since the beginning of 2018, there is still a risk that the Average Closing Price will decline in the future and that the Trust Units could be delisted, in which case they may be transferred to the over-the-counter (\"OTC\") market, a significantly more limited market than the NYSE, which could affect the market price, trading volume, liquidity and resale price of the Trust Units. Securities that trade on the OTC markets also typically experience more volatility compared to securities that trade on a national securities exchange.. Conflicts of interest could arise between PCEC and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Trust and the Trust unitholders, on the other hand, which could harm the business or financial results of the Trust.. As working interest owners in, and the operators of substantially all wells on, the Underlying Properties, PCEC and its affiliates could have interests that conflict with the interests of the Trust and the Trust unitholders. For example:.                   PCEC's interests may conflict with those of the Trust and the Trust unitholders in situations involving the development, maintenance, operation or abandonment of certain wells on the Underlying Properties for which PCEC acts as the operator. PCEC may also make decisions with respect to development expenses that adversely affect the Underlying Properties. These decisions include reducing development expenses for those properties for which PCEC acts as the operator, which could cause oil and natural gas production to decline at a faster rate and thereby result in lower cash distributions by the Trust in the future..                   PCEC may sell some or all of the Underlying Properties without taking into consideration the interests of the Trust unitholders. Such sales may not be in the best interests of the Trust unitholders and the purchasers may lack PCEC's experience or its credit worthiness. PCEC also has the right, under certain circumstances, to cause the Trust to release all or a portion of the Conveyed Interests in connection with a sale of a portion of the Underlying Properties to which such Conveyed Interests relates. In such an event, the Trust is entitled to receive the fair market value (net of sales costs) of the Conveyed Interests released, which will be treated as an offset amount against costs and expenses. Please read \"Properties - Abandonment and Sale of Underlying Properties\" in Item 2 of this Annual Report.. The Trust is managed by a Trustee who cannot be replaced except by a majority vote of the Trust unitholders at a special meeting, which may make it difficult for Trust unitholders to remove or replace the Trustee.. The affairs of the Trust are managed by the Trustee. The voting rights of a Trust unitholder are more limited than those of stockholders of most public corporations. For example, there is no requirement for the Trust to hold annual meetings of Trust unitholders or for an annual or other periodic re-election of the Trustee. The Trust does not intend to hold annual meetings of Trust unitholders. The Trust Agreement provides that the Trustee may only be removed and replaced by the holders of a majority of the Trust Units present in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders where a quorum is present, including Trust Units held by PCEC, called by either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 10% of the outstanding Trust Units.. 25. Table of Contents. Trust unitholders have limited ability to enforce provisions of the Conveyance creating the Conveyed Interests, and PCEC's liability to the Trust is limited.. The Trust Agreement permits the Trustee to sue PCEC or any other future owner of the Underlying Properties to enforce the terms of the Conveyance creating the Conveyed Interests. If the Trustee does not take appropriate action to enforce provisions of the Conveyance, Trust unitholders' recourse would be limited to bringing a lawsuit against the Trustee to compel the Trustee to take specified actions. The Trust Agreement expressly limits a Trust unitholder's ability to directly sue PCEC or any other third party other than the Trustee. As a result, Trust unitholders are not able to sue PCEC or any future owner of the Underlying Properties to enforce these rights. Furthermore, the conveyance creating the Conveyed Interests provides that, except as set forth in the Conveyance, PCEC will not be liable to the Trust for the manner in which it performs its duties in operating the Underlying Properties as long as it acts without gross negligence or willful misconduct.. Courts outside of Delaware may not recognize the limited liability of the Trust unitholders provided under Delaware law.. Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, Trust unitholders are entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of corporations for profit under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Nevertheless, courts in jurisdictions outside of Delaware could decline to give effect to such limitation.. The operations of the Underlying Properties are subject to environmental laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting operations on them or result in significant costs and liabilities, which could reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to Trust unitholders.. The oil and natural gas exploration and production operations on the Underlying Properties are subject to stringent and comprehensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the release, discharge or emission of materials into the environment, the handling of hazardous substances or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that apply to the operations on the Underlying Properties, including the requirement to obtain a permit before conducting drilling, waste disposal or other regulated activities; the restriction of types, quantities and concentrations of materials that can be released into the environment; restrictions on water withdrawal and use; the incurrence of significant development expenses to install pollution or safety-related controls at the operated facilities; the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wetlands and other protected areas; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations. For example, the EPA has published regulations that impose more stringent emissions control requirements for oil and natural gas development and production operations, which may require PCEC, its operators, or third-party contractors to incur additional expenses to control air emissions from current operations and during new well developments by installing emissions control technologies and adhering to a variety of work practice and other requirements. These requirements could increase the costs of development and production, reducing the profits available to the Trust and potentially impairing the economic development of the Underlying Properties. Portions of PCEC's areas of operation are located in areas that host several endangered plant and animal species. The known presence of these endangered species may limit future operations in certain areas of the properties and will result in increased costs of development as certain procedures must be used to protect such species and costs may be incurred to provide habitat areas or substitute replacement areas.. In addition, any future attempt by PCEC to increase production in the Diatomite formation beyond the currently permitted wells will require additional permits and approvals from various state, federal and local agencies, in addition to a new review under the CEQA, possibly including an environmental impact report. Such a process could take many months or longer, and there can be no assurance that such permits would be timely obtained or on terms and conditions consistent with PCEC's proposed plan.. For all of PCEC's operations, numerous governmental authorities such as the EPA, analogous state agencies such as the DOGGR and local agencies such as the County of Santa Barbara Planning and Development, Energy Division, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often times requiring difficult and costly actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations; and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of the operations on the Underlying Properties. Furthermore, the inability to comply with environmental laws and regulations in a cost-effective manner, such as removal and disposal of produced water and other generated oil and natural gas wastes, could impair PCEC's ability to produce oil and natural gas commercially from the Underlying Properties, which would reduce profits and royalties attributable to the Conveyed Interests.. There is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the operations on the Underlying Properties as a result of the handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, air emissions and wastewater discharges related to operations, and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, PCEC could be subject to joint and several strict liability for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property. 26. Table of Contents. contamination regardless of whether PCEC was responsible for the release or contamination or whether PCEC was in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. Private parties, including the owners of properties upon which wells are drilled and facilities where petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. In addition, the risk of accidental spills or releases could expose PCEC to significant liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on PCEC's business, financial condition and results of operations and could reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to Trust unitholders. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly operational control requirements or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require PCEC to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. PCEC may be unable to recover some or any of these costs from insurance, in which case the amount of cash received by the Trust may be decreased. The Trust indirectly bears an 80% share of all costs and expenses related to the production from the Developed Properties and a 25% share of all costs and expenses related to the production from the Remaining Properties, including those related to environmental compliance and liabilities associated with the Underlying Properties, including costs and liabilities resulting from conditions that existed prior to PCEC's acquisition of the Underlying Properties unless such costs and expenses result from the operator's negligence or misconduct. In addition, as a result of the increased cost of compliance, PCEC may decide to discontinue drilling.. The operations of the Underlying Properties are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting operations on them or expose the operator to significant liabilities, which could reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to Trust unitholders.. The production and development operations on the Underlying Properties are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. In order to conduct its operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, PCEC must obtain and maintain numerous permits, drilling bonds, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities and engage in extensive reporting. PCEC may incur substantial costs and experience delays in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations, and the Trust's income is reduced by its 80% share of such costs related to the production from the Developed Properties and a 25% share of such costs related to the production from the Remaining Properties. In addition, PCEC's costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to its operations. Such costs could have a material adverse effect on PCEC's business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the amount of cash received by the Trust in respect of the Conveyed Interests. For example, in California, there have been proposals at the legislative initiative and executive levels in the past for tax increases that have included a severance tax as high as 12.5% on all oil production in California. The County of Santa Barbara also recently considered imposing a severance tax. Although the proposals have not passed, the State of California could impose a severance tax on oil in the future. While PCEC cannot predict the impact of such a tax given the uncertainty of the proposals, the imposition of such a tax could have severe negative impacts on both its willingness and ability to incur capital expenditures to increase production, could severely reduce or completely eliminate PCEC's profit margins and would result in lower oil production in PCEC's properties due to the need to shut-in wells and facilities made uneconomic either immediately or at an earlier time than would have previously been the case. PCEC must also comply with laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and market manipulations in energy markets.. Laws and regulations governing exploration and production may also affect production levels. PCEC is required to comply with federal and state laws and regulations governing conservation matters, including:.                   provisions related to the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties;.                   the spacing of wells;.                   the plugging and abandonment of wells; and.                   the removal of related production equipment.. Several jurisdictions in California, including Santa Barbara County, have proposed various forms of moratoria or bans on hydraulic fracturing and other hydrocarbon recovery techniques, including traditional waterflooding, acid treatments and cyclic steam injection. A local initiative in Santa Barbara County obtained sufficient signatures to be placed on the ballot in Santa Barbara County in November 2014 but did not receive enough votes to pass. If the initiative had passed, however, the proposed amendments would have directly or indirectly prohibited utilization of waterflooding, cyclic steam injection, acid use for stimulation or maintenance, water injection, and a variety of other recovery methods, on future well sites, and could have materially reduced or prohibited utilization of such recovery techniques from currently producing wells, within Santa Barbara County. The proposed amendments would have also prohibited the use of hydraulic fracturing in Santa Barbara County.. 27. Table of Contents. Additionally, state and federal regulatory authorities may expand or alter applicable pipeline safety laws and regulations, compliance with which may require increased capital costs on the part of PCEC and third-party downstream oil and natural gas transporters. These and other laws and regulations can limit the amount of oil and natural gas PCEC can produce from its wells, limit the number of wells it can drill, or limit the locations at which it can conduct drilling operations, which in turn could negatively impact Trust distributions, estimated and actual future net revenues to the Trust and estimates of reserves attributable to the Trust's interests.. New laws or regulations, or changes to existing laws or regulations, may unfavorably impact PCEC, could result in increased operating costs or have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations and reduce the amount of cash received by the Trust. For example, Congress has considered legislation that, if adopted, would subject companies involved in oil and natural gas exploration and production activities to, among other items, the elimination of certain U.S. federal tax incentives and deductions available to oil and natural gas exploration and production activities and the prohibition or additional regulation of private energy commodity derivative and hedging activities. These and other potential regulations could increase the operating costs of PCEC, reduce its liquidity, delay its operations or otherwise alter the way PCEC conducts its business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Trust and the amount of cash available for distribution to Trust unitholders.. The assessment of significant property taxes against PCEC could materially adversely impact the amount of cash available for distributions by the Trust to unitholders.. From time to time, PCEC receives property tax bills or supplemental property tax assessments from various counties where PCEC's properties are located. In some cases where PCEC does not agree with the tax assessments received, it pays the property taxes under appeal until an agreement can be reached with the county involved in the dispute.  In cases where the resolution between PCEC and the county results in additional property tax expenses, the additional cost would be allocated to the Underlying Properties and the Net Profits Interests. These additional property taxes could be significant and consequently could impact the amount available for distributions by the Trust.. In March 2016, PCEC reached a settlement agreement with the Santa Barbara County Assessor's Office on supplemental property tax bills related to the tax years covering the periods July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2016. The supplemental tax bills relate to the settlement of disputed property values for Orcutt Conventional and Orcutt Diatomite field locations for these periods. Amounts attributable to the period from April 1, 2012 through June 30, 2016 totaled $2.1 million for the Developed Properties and $1.3 million for the Remaining Properties and were charged in part to the Trust in the March 2016 production month calculation of the net profits. The property tax adjustment amounts attributable to the Trust increased the cumulative Net Profits Interest deficits of the Developed Properties and the Remaining Properties by $1.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Similar property tax adjustments could occur again, including for other properties and with respect to other time periods and could result in decreases to amounts payable to the Trust pursuant to the Net Profits Interests.. Climate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of \"greenhouse gases\" could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that PCEC produces while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt their production and cause it to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.. In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other \"greenhouse gases\" present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has issued regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. These regulations include limits on tailpipe emissions from motor vehicles and pre-construction and operating permit requirements for certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States, as well as certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis. In December 2015, the EPA finalized rules that added new sources to the scope of the greenhouse gases monitoring and reporting rule. The revisions also include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities. In addition, EPA adopted federal New Source Performance Standards for new oil and gas facilities that require control of the greenhouse gas methane from affected facilities, including requirements to find and repair fugitive leaks of methane emissions at well sites in June 2016.  EPA in 2017 announced that it would convene a proceeding to reconsider parts of the June 2016 rule, and has proposed to delay the implementation of the rule.  The ultimate fate of the new methane control requirements established in the June 2016 oil and gas NSPS is unclear; however, these rules could result in increased compliance costs for PCEC.. In addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, and many of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through the implementation of state and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal.. 28. Table of Contents. California has been one of the leading states in adopting greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements and has implemented a cap and trade program as well as mandates for renewable fuels sources. California's cap and trade program requires PCEC to report greenhouse gas emissions and essentially sets maximum limits or caps on total emissions of greenhouse gases from all industrial sectors that are or become subject to the program. PCEC's main sources of greenhouse gas emissions for oil and gas operations are primarily attributable to emissions from internal combustion engines powering wells emissions from drilling rigs and the steam generators that are used to produce steam for cyclic steaming. In June 2017, California passed AB 398, legislation extending the cap and trade program from its previous set termination of 2020 to 2030.  The program will continue largely unchanged, however, the new bill makes changes including: (i) a price ceiling and price containment points for the sale of allowances and (ii) limits on the use of offsets and requirements for offsets that directly benefit California.  However, final details of the legislation have not yet been released. Under the prior California program, the cap declines annually from 2013 through 2020. The rate of the decline of the cap has not yet been released under AB 398.  PCEC will be required to obtain authorizations for each metric ton of greenhouse gases emitted, either in the form of allowances (each the equivalent of one ton of carbon dioxide) or qualifying offset credits. A portion of the allowance will be granted by the state, but any shortfall between the state-granted allowance and the facility's emissions will have to be addressed through the purchase of additional allowances either from the state or a third party. The availability of allowances will decline over time in accordance with the declining cap, and the cost to acquire such allowances may increase over time. These regulations increase PCEC's costs for those operations and adversely affect its operating results. Because regulation of greenhouse gas emissions is relatively new, further regulatory, legislative and judicial developments are likely to occur. Such developments may affect how these greenhouse gas initiatives will impact PCEC and the Trust. Due to the uncertainties surrounding the regulation of and other risks associated with greenhouse gas emissions, PCEC cannot predict the financial impact of related developments on PCEC or the Trust.. Due to the Trust's lack of geographic and industry diversification, adverse developments in California could adversely impact the results of operations and cash flows of the Underlying Properties and reduce the amount of cash available for distributions to Trust unitholders.. The operations of the Underlying Properties are focused exclusively on the production and development of oil and natural gas within the state of California. As a result, the results of operations and cash flows of the Underlying Properties depend upon continuing operations in this area. This concentration could disproportionately expose the Trust's interests to operational and regulatory risk in this area. Due to the lack of diversification in geographic location, adverse developments in exploration and production of oil and natural gas in this area of operation could have a significantly greater impact on the results of operations and cash flows of the Underlying Properties than if the operations were more diversified.. Tax Risks Related to the Trust's Trust Units. The Trust has not requested a ruling from the IRS regarding the tax treatment of the Trust. If the IRS were to determine (and be sustained in that determination) that the Trust is not a \"grantor trust\" for federal income tax purposes, the Trust could be subject to more complex and costly tax reporting requirements that could reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to Trust unitholders.. If the Trust were not treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes, the Trust may be properly classified as a partnership for such purposes. Although the Trust would not become subject to federal income taxation at the entity level as a result of treatment as a partnership, and items of income, gain, loss and deduction would flow through to the Trust unitholders, the Trust's tax compliance requirements would be more complex and costly to implement and maintain, and its distributions to Trust unitholders could be reduced as a result.. Neither PCEC nor the Trustee has requested a ruling from the IRS regarding the tax status of the Trust, and neither PCEC nor the Trustee intends to request such a ruling or can assure you that such a ruling would be granted if requested or that the IRS will not challenge these positions on audit.. Trust unitholders should be aware of the possible state tax implications of owning Trust Units and should consult with their tax advisors.. Certain U.S. federal income tax preferences currently available with respect to oil and natural gas production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.. The passage of any legislation or changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, which could reduce the cash available for distribution to the Trust unitholders or adversely affect the value of the Trust Units.. 29. Table of Contents. Unitholders are required to pay taxes on their share of the Trust's income even if they do not receive any cash distributions from the Trust.. Trust unitholders are treated as if they own the Trust's assets and receive the Trust's income and are directly taxable thereon as if no Trust were in existence. Because the Trust generates taxable income that could be different in amount than the cash the Trust distributes, unitholders are required to pay any federal and applicable California income taxes and, in some cases, other state and local income taxes on their share of the Trust's taxable income even if they receive no cash distributions from the Trust. A unitholder may not receive cash distributions from the Trust equal to such unitholder's share of the Trust's taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income.. A portion of any tax gain on the disposition of the Trust Units could be taxed as ordinary income.. If a unitholder sells Trust Units, the unitholder will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the unitholder's tax basis in those Trust Units. A substantial portion of any gain recognized may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items, including depletion recapture. Potential investors should consult with their tax advisors prior to acquiring Trust Units. Please see \" Federal Income Tax Matters\" in  Item 1 \"Business\" in this Form 10-K for additional information.. The Trust allocates its items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of the Trust Units each month based upon the ownership of the Trust Units on the monthly record date, instead of on the basis of the date a particular Trust Unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among the Trust unitholders.. The Trust generally allocates its items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of the Trust Units each month based upon the ownership of the Trust Units on the monthly record date, instead of on the basis of the date a particular Trust Unit is transferred. It is possible that the IRS could disagree with this allocation method and could assert that income and deductions of the Trust should be determined and allocated on a daily or prorated basis, which could require adjustments to the tax returns of the Trust unitholders affected by the issue and result in an increase in the administrative expense of the Trust in subsequent periods.. As a result of investing in Trust Units, unitholders may become subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in California.. In addition to federal income taxes, Trust unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes, including state and local taxes that are imposed in California, where the Underlying Properties are located, even if the Trust unitholders do not live in California. Trust unitholders likely are required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in California. Further, Trust unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. It is the responsibility of each Trust unitholder to file all federal, state and local tax returns.. At the time of the formation of the Trust, PCEC on behalf of the Trust obtained a two-year waiver from the State of California of the requirement to withhold 7% of the amounts paid to the Trust that are attributable to the Conveyed Interests held by unitholders not qualifying for an exemption from withholding. PCEC on behalf of the Trust will  use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain such waiver, including by seeking a renewal of such waiver prior to its expiration under California law. The Trust has received a renewal of the waiver for the years 2018 and 2019. The Trust may not be able to obtain such a waiver in the future, in which case PCEC on behalf of the Trust would be required to withhold such amounts beginning with the distribution expected to be paid in January 2020."
