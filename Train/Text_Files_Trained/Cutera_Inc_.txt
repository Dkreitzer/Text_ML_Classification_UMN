[1] "ITEM 1A. \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRISK FACTORS. We operate in a rapidly changing economic and technological environment that presents numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations, including causing our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. The following list of significant risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may materially adversely affect us in future periods. You should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.. Our annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future, which may cause our share price to decline.. Our net sales, expenses and operating results may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter for several reasons, including, without limitation:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability of our sales force to effectively market and promote our products, and the extent to which those products gain market acceptance; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe existence and timing of any product approvals or changes; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe rate and size of expenditures incurred on our clinical, manufacturing, sales, marketing and product development efforts; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to obtain and retain personnel; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of key components, materials and contract services, which depends on our ability to forecast sales, among other things; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinvestigations of our business and business-related activities by regulatory or other governmental authorities; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvariations in timing and quantity of product orders; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttemporary manufacturing interruptions or disruptions; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing and success of new product and new market introductions, as well as delays in obtaining domestic or foreign regulatory approvals for such introductions; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased competition, patent expirations or new technologies or treatments; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct recalls or safety alerts; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlitigation, including product liability, patent, employment, securities class action, stockholder derivative, general commercial and other lawsuits; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontinued volatility in the global market and worldwide economic conditions, including, but not limited to, the impact of events such as Brexit; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in tax laws, including changes due to Brexit, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe financial health of our customers and their ability to purchase our products in the current economic environment; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother unusual or non-operating expenses, such as expenses related to mergers or acquisitions, may cause operating result variations.. As a result of any of these factors, our consolidated results of operations may fluctuate significantly, which may in turn cause our share price to fluctuate.. If we do not continue to develop, or acquire, and commercialize new products and identify new markets for our products and technology, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could suffer.. The aesthetic laser and light-based treatment system industry is subject to continuous technological development and product innovation. If we do not continue to innovate and develop new products and applications, our competitive position will likely deteriorate as other companies successfully design and commercialize new products and applications. Accordingly, our success depends in part on developing or acquiring new and innovative applications of laser and other light-based technology and identifying new markets for and applications of existing products and technology. If we are unable to develop and commercialize new products, identify and acquire complementary businesses, products or technologies, and identify new markets for our products and technology, our product and technology offerings could become obsolete and our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.. To successfully expand our product offerings, we must, among other things:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelop or acquire new technologies that either add to or significantly improve our current products; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconvince our target practitioner customers that our new products or product upgrades would be attractive revenue-generating additions to their practices; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsell our products to non-traditional customers, including primary care physicians, gynecologists and other specialists; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tidentify new markets and emerging technological trends in our target markets and react effectively to technological changes; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpreserve goodwill and brand value with customers.. 21. Table of Contents. Revenue growth in our business is driven by several factors and one such factor is new product introductions. Our ability to sustain profitability depends on our ability to introduce new products that are adopted by our customers and on the extent to which we can increase revenue and control our costs to be able to leverage our expenses. In addition, we need to be able to counter any unforeseen difficulties, complications, product delays or other unknown factors that may require additional expenditures. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our growth prospects, product development, sales and marketing and other efforts, unforeseen litigation expenses, etc., we are unable to predict the extent of our future profitability or losses.. The success and continuing development of our products depends, in part, upon maintaining strong relationships with physicians and other healthcare professionals.. If we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and other ancillary healthcare professionals, our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products. Physicians assist us as researchers, marketing consultants, product consultants, and public speakers, and we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience. If we are unable to maintain these strong relationships, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.. We rely heavily on our sales professionals to market and sell our products worldwide. If we are unable to hire, effectively train, manage, improve the productivity of, and retain our sales professionals, our business will be harmed, which would impair our future revenue and profitability.. Our success largely depends on our ability to hire, train, manage and improve the productivity levels of our sales professionals worldwide. Because of our focus on non-core practitioners in the past, several of our sales professionals do not have established relationships with the core market, consisting of dermatologists and plastic surgeons, or where those relationships exist, they are not very strong.. We have experienced direct sales employee and sales management turnover in North America, Japan, and Europe. Competition for sales professionals who are familiar and trained to sell in the aesthetic equipment market continues to be strong. As a result, we have lost some of our sales people to our competitors. Our industry is characterized by a few established companies that compete vigorously for talented sales professionals. Further, as the economy in North America has rebounded from the recent recession, some of those sales professionals have left our company for jobs that they perceive to be better opportunities, both within and outside of the aesthetic industry. However, we have also hired a record number of new sales people, including several from our competitors. Several of our sales employees and sales management have been recently hired or recently transferred into different roles, and it will take time for them to be fully trained to improve their productivity. In addition, due to the competition for sales professionals in our industry, we have recruited sales professionals from outside the industry. Sales professionals from outside the industry take longer to train and to become familiar with our products and the procedures in which they are used. As a result of a lack of industry knowledge, these sales professionals may take longer to become productive members of our sales force.. We train our existing and recently recruited sales professionals to better understand our existing and new product technologies and how they can be positioned against our competitors’ products. These initiatives are intended to improve the productivity of our sales professionals and our revenue and profitability. It takes time for the sales professionals to become productive following their training and there can be no assurance that the recently recruited sales professionals will be adequately trained in a timely manner, or that our direct sales productivity will improve, or that we will not experience significant levels of attrition in the future.. Measures we implement in an effort to recruit, retain, train and manage our sales professionals, strengthen their relationships with core market physicians, and improve their productivity may not be successful and may instead contribute to instability in our operations, additional departures from our sales organization, or further reduce our revenue and harm our business. If we are not able to improve the productivity and retention of our North American and international sales professionals, then our total revenue, profitability and stock price may be adversely impacted.. The aesthetic equipment market is characterized by rapid innovation. To compete effectively, we must develop and/or acquire new products, market them successfully, and identify new markets for our technology.. We have created products to apply our technology to body contouring, hair removal, treatment of veins, tattoo removal, and skin rejuvenation, including the treatment of diffuse redness, skin laxity, fine lines, wrinkles, skin texture, pore size and benign pigmented lesions, etc. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we added a required third wavelength (670 nm) to our enlighten platform to improve clearing of green, blue and purple tattoo inks and launched the product as enlighten III. We also lunched truSculpt 3D, Secret and Juliet in 2017.To grow in the future, we must continue to develop and/or acquire new and innovative aesthetic products and applications, identify new markets, and successfully launch the newly acquired or developed product offerings.. 22. Table of Contents. To successfully expand our product offerings, we must, among other things:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelop or otherwise acquire new products that either add to or significantly improve our current product offerings; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconvince our existing and prospective customers that our product offerings are an attractive revenue-generating addition to their practice; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsell our product offerings to a broad customer base; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tidentify new markets and alternative applications for our technology; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprotect our existing and future products with defensible intellectual property; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsatisfy and maintain all regulatory requirements for commercialization.. Historically, product introductions have been a significant component of our financial performance. To be successful in the aesthetics industry, we need to continue to innovate. Our business strategy has therefore been based, in part, on our expectation that we will continue to increase our product offerings. We need to continue to devote substantial research and development resources to make new product introductions, which can be costly and time consuming to our organization.. We also believe that, to increase revenue from sales of new products, we need to continue to develop our clinical support, further expand and nurture relationships with industry thought leaders and increase market awareness of the benefits of our new products. However, even with a significant investment in research and development, we may be unable to continue to develop, acquire or effectively launch and market new products and technologies regularly, or at all. If we fail to successfully commercialize new products, our business may be harmed.. While we attempt to protect our products through patents and other intellectual property, there are few barriers to entry that would prevent new entrants or existing competitors from developing products that compete directly with ours. We expect that any competitive advantage we may enjoy from current and future innovations may diminish over time as companies successfully respond to our, or create their own, innovations. Consequently, we believe that we will have to continuously innovate and improve our products and technology to compete successfully. If we are unable to innovate successfully, our products could become obsolete and our revenue could decline as our customers and prospects purchase our competitors’ products.. Demand for our products in any of our markets could be weakened by several factors, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinability to develop and market our products to the core market specialties of dermatologists and plastic surgeons; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpoor financial performance of market segments that attempt to introduce aesthetic procedures to their businesses; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduced patient demand for elective aesthetic procedures; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure to build and maintain relationships with opinion leaders within the various market segments; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe lack of credit financing, or an increase in the cost of borrowing, for some of our potential customers.. If we do not achieve anticipated demand for our products, there could be a material adverse effect on our total revenue, profitability, employee retention and stock price.. We depend on skilled and experienced personnel to operate our global business effectively. Changes to management or the inability to recruit, hire, train and retain qualified personnel, could harm our ability to successfully manage, develop and expand our business, which would impair our future revenue and profitability.. Our success largely depends on the skills, experience and efforts of our officers and other key employees. The loss of any of our executive officers could weaken our management expertise and harm our business, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all. Except for Change of Control and Severance Agreements for our executive officers and a few key employees, we do not have employment contracts with any of our officers or other key employees. Any of our officers and other key employees may terminate their employment at any time and their knowledge of our business and industry would be difficult to replace. For instance, we announced on February 9, 2018, that Miguel Pardos resigned his position as Executive Vice President, International Sales of Cutera, effective on February 28, 2018, to pursue other opportunities. Cutera reassigned Mr. Pardos’ duties among existing members of the International team and we do not expect any adverse effects from his departure. We do not have a succession plan in place for each of our officers and key employees. In addition, we do not maintain “key person” life insurance policies covering any of our employees.. 23. Table of Contents. We recently hired a new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”). Prior to the confirmation, she performed the duties of the Chief Financial Officer on an interim consulting basis beginning July 12, 2017. Her prior experience included Chief Financial Officer in the medical device and our aesthetics industry specifically, and other Companies in the life science industry. However, recently hired executives may view the business differently than prior members of management, and over time may make changes to the existing personnel and their responsibilities, our strategic focus, operations or business plans. We can give no assurances that we will be able to properly manage any such shift in focus, or that any changes to our business, would ultimately prove successful. In addition, leadership transitions and management changes can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty or a disruption to our business or may increase the likelihood of turnover in key officers and employees. Our success depends in part on having a successful leadership team. If we cannot effectively manage the leadership transitions and management changes, it could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and pursue our business goals. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our executive officers or other key employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees, retaining and motivating existing employees or integrating new executives and employees, our business could be materially and adversely affected.. Our ability to retain our skilled labor force and our success in attracting and hiring new skilled employees are critical factors in determining whether we will be successful in the future. We may not be able to meet our future hiring needs or retain existing personnel. The staff we hire to perform administrative functions may become stretched due to our increased growth and they may not be able to perform their jobs effectively or efficiently as a result.. We may face particularly significant challenges and risks in hiring, training, managing and retaining engineering and sales and marketing employees. Failure to attract, train and retain personnel, particularly technical and sales and marketing personnel, would materially harm our ability to compete effectively and grow our business.. Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.. We rely on networks, information management software and other technology, or information systems, including the Internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, order processing and collection of payments. We use information systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. In addition, we depend on information systems for digital marketing activities and electronic communications among our locations around the world and between company personnel as well as customers and suppliers. Because information systems are critical to many of our operating activities, our business processes may be impacted by system shutdowns or service disruptions. These disruptions may be caused by failures during routine operations such as system upgrades or user errors, as well as network or hardware failures, malicious or disruptive software, computer hackers, geopolitical events, natural disasters, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks, or other catastrophic events. These events could result in unauthorized disclosure of material confidential information. If our information systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments. Misuse, leakage or falsification of information could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations and damage our reputation and credibility, and could expose us to liability. We may also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems. Like most major corporations, our information systems are a target of attacks. As of December 2017, we have not had any disruptions to our information systems that have materially affected our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that such disruptions will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future.. Macroeconomic political and market conditions, and catastrophic events may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.. Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral macro-economic and business conditions in our key markets of North America, Japan, Asia (excluding Japan), the Middle East, Europe and Australia; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe lack of credit financing, or an increase in the cost of borrowing, for some of our potential customers due to increasing interest rates; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe overall demand for our products by the core market specialties of dermatologists and plastic surgeons; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing and success of new product introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive landscape of the market for non-surgical aesthetic procedures, including consolidation among our competitors; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of awareness of aesthetic procedures and the market adoption of our products; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgovernmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral political developments, both domestic and in our foreign markets, including economic and political uncertainty caused by the recent election of a new U.S. president; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnatural disasters;. 24. Table of Contents. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttax law changes \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcurrency exchange rate fluctuations; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany trade restrictions or higher import taxes that may be imposed by foreign countries against products sold internationally by U.S. companies.. Macroeconomic developments, like global recessions and financial crises could negatively affect our business, operating results or financial condition which, in turn, could adversely affect our stock price. A general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce their budgets or be unable to fund product or upgrade application purchases, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services.. In addition, political unrest in regions like the Middle East, terrorist attacks around the globe and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world, potential public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability.. Macroeconomic declines, negative political developments, adverse market conditions and catastrophic events may cause a decline in our revenue, negatively affect our operating results, adversely affect our cash flow and could result in a decline in our stock price.. The price of our common stock has increased by approximately 24% in the six months ended March 1, 2018 and may fluctuate substantially due to several factors, some of which are discussed below. Further, we have a limited number of shares of common stock outstanding, a large portion of which is held by a small number of investors, which could result in the increase in volatility of our stock price.. The price of our common stock has increased by approximately 24% in the six months ended March 1, 2018 due in part to our recent improved revenue and profitability performance, the purchase of two of our competitors (Cynosure and Zeltiq) in February 2017, the financial guidance we communicated to the investor community in February 2018, repurchases of our stock, the overall rise in the stock market following the passage of the new tax bill in December 2017 and other factors. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 49% of our outstanding shares of common stock were held by 10 institutional investors. As a result of our relatively small public float, our common stock may be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price for our shares than would be the case if our public float were larger. The public market price of our common stock has in the past fluctuated substantially and, due to the current concentration of stockholders, may continue to do so in the future.. The market price for our common stock could also be affected by a number of other factors, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlitigation surrounding executive compensation has increased. If we are involved in a lawsuit related to compensation matters or any other matters not covered by our D&O insurance, there could be material expenses involved, fines, or remedial actions which could negatively affect our stock price; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe general market conditions unrelated to our operating performance; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and our large institutional investors; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tquarterly variations in our, or our competitors’, results of operations; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactual or anticipated changes in analysts’ estimates, investors’ perceptions, recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analysts’ estimates; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe announcement of new products, service enhancements, distributor relationships or acquisitions by us or our competitors; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe announcement of the departure of a key employee or executive officer by us or our competitors; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory developments or delays concerning our, or our competitors’ products; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe initiation of any other litigation by us or against us.. Actual or perceived instability and / or volatility in our stock price could reduce demand from potential buyers of our stock, thereby causing our stock price to either remain depressed or to decline further.. In addition, if the market for medical-device company stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Any future securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. 25. Table of Contents. We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results, which could cause our stock price to decline.. We started providing, and may continue to provide, financial guidance about our business and future operating results. In developing this guidance, our management must make certain assumptions and judgments about our future operating performance, including projected hiring of sales professionals, continued growth of revenue in the aesthetic device market, continue to increase our market share, reduce costs of production of our recently introduced products, and continued stability of the macro-economic environment in our key markets. Furthermore, analysts and investors may develop and publish their own projections of our business, which may form a consensus about our future performance. Our business results may vary significantly from such guidance or that consensus due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and which could adversely affect our operations and operating results. Furthermore, if we make downward revisions of our previously announced guidance, or if our publicly announced guidance of future operating results fails to meet expectations of securities analysts, investors or other interested parties, the price of our common stock would decline.. To successfully market and sell our products internationally, we must address many issues that are unique to our international business. Furthermore, international expansion is a key component of our growth strategy, although our international operations and foreign transactions expose us to additional operational challenges that we might not otherwise face.. We are focused on international expansion as a key component of our growth strategy and have identified specific areas of opportunity in various international markets. International revenue is a material component of our business strategy, and represented 38% of our total revenue in 2017 compared to 45% of our total revenue in 2016. In addition, while our international revenue in 2016 increased by 8% compared to 2015, it was negatively impacted by the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar versus the major currencies in which we transact. We depend on third-party distributors and a direct sales force to sell our products internationally, and if they underperform, we may be unable to increase or maintain our level of international revenue. For example, our direct business in Japan slightly declined in 2017 compared to 2016, due in part to the negative impact of foreign exchange and employee turnover, which negatively impacted our revenue from international operations.. We have experienced significant turnover of our international sales team in the past. For instance, we announced on February 9, 2018, that Miguel Pardos resigned his position as Executive Vice President, International Sales of Cutera, effective on February 28, 2018. Cutera reassigned Mr. Pardos’ duties among existing members of the International team and we do not expect any adverse effects from his departure. While we continue to have a direct sales and service organization in Australia, Japan, France, Belgium, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, a significant portion of our international revenue is generated through our network of distributors. Though we continue to evaluate and replace non-performing distributors, and have recently brought greater focus on collaborating with our distributor partners, there can be no assurance given that these initiatives will result in improved international revenue or profitability in the future.. To grow our business, we will need to improve productivity in current sales territories and expand into new territories. However, direct sales productivity may not improve and distributors may not accept our business or commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations. If we are not able to increase or maintain international revenue growth, our total revenue, profitability and stock price may be adversely impacted.. We believe, as we continue to manage our international operations and develop opportunities in additional international territories, our international revenue will be subject to a number of risks, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuating foreign currency exchange rates; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing operations in multiple locations as a result of, among other things, distance, language and cultural differences; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased management, travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with having multiple international operations; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical and economic uncertainty around the world, such as the recent presidential elections in France and Germany, the October 2017 referendum in Spain in which Catalonia voted to separate from Spain, and the United Kingdom’s referendum in June 2016 in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (“EU”), commonly referred to as “Brexit”; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties and expenses related to implementing internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures;. 26. Table of Contents. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompliance with multiple and changing foreign laws and regulations, including foreign certification and regulatory requirements and the risks and costs of non-compliance with such laws and regulations; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlengthy payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompliance with laws and regulations for foreign operations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell our offerings in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\tcustoms clearance and shipping delays, and export/import controls and tariff regulations; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlack of awareness of our brand in international markets; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toperation in parts of the world where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpreference for locally-produced products, as well as protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and practical difficulties of enforcing intellectual property and contract rights abroad.. If one or more of these risks were realized, it could require us to dedicate significant resources to remedy the situation; and if we were unsuccessful at finding a solution, we may not be able to sell our products in a particular market and, as a result, our revenue may decline.. Our global operations are required to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (\"FCPA\"), Chinese anti-corruption, U.K. Bribery Law, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions and with U.S. and foreign export control, trade embargo and customs laws. If we fail to comply with any of these laws, we could suffer civil and criminal sanctions.. Further, the June 2016 referendum in the United Kingdom (\"UK\") in which voters approved a withdrawal from the EU, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” has created uncertainty. Subsequent to the referendum, in March 2017, the UK formally initiated its withdrawal from the EU by triggering Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon. As a result of the triggering of Article 50, the process of negotiating the terms of the UK’s exit from the EU, which is expected to take two years, has commenced. Although it is unknown what those terms will be, we may face new regulatory costs and challenges that may have a material adverse effect on us and our operations. For example, any new regulations could add time and expense to the conduct of our business, as well as the process by which our products receive regulatory approval in the UK, the EU and elsewhere. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what economic, financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the UK from the EU would have and how such withdrawal may affect us.. In addition, compliance with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. We may be unable to keep current with changes in foreign government requirements and laws as they change from time to time. Failure to comply with these regulations could have adverse effects on our business. In many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or United States regulations applicable to us. In addition, although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, distributors and agents will comply with these laws and policies. Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, distributors or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition, financial reporting misstatements, fines, penalties, or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our offerings and could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial results.. To successfully market and sell third party products internationally, we must address many issues that are unique to the related distribution arrangements which could reduce our available cash reserves and negatively impact our profitability.. We have entered into distribution arrangements pursuant to which we utilize our sales force and distributors to sell products manufactured by other companies. In Japan, we have a non-exclusive right to distribute a Q-switched laser product manufactured by a third party OEM. We also have an exclusive agreement with ZO to distribute certain of their proprietary skincare products in Japan. Each of these agreements requires us to purchase annual minimum dollar amounts of their products.. Each of these distribution agreements presents its own unique risks and challenges. For example, to sell skincare products we need to invest in creating a sales structure that is experienced in the sale of such products and not in capital equipment. We need to commit resources to train our sales force, obtain regulatory licenses in Japan and develop new marketing materials to promote the sale of skincare products. In addition, the minimum commitments and other costs of distributing products manufactured by these companies may exceed the incremental revenue that we derive from the sale of their products, thereby negatively impacting our profitability and reducing our available cash reserves.. If we do not make the minimum purchases required in the distribution contracts, or if the third party manufacturer revokes our distribution rights, we could lose the distribution rights of the products to physicians in Japan, which would adversely affect our future revenue, results of operations, cash flows and our stock price.. 27. Table of Contents. We offer credit terms to some qualified customers and also to leasing companies to finance the purchase of our products. In the event that any of these customers default on the amounts payable to us, our earnings may be adversely affected.. We generally offer credit terms of 30 to 90 days to qualified customers. In addition, from time to time, we offer certain key international distributors, with whom we have had an extended period of relationship and payment history, payment terms that are significantly longer than the regular 30 to 90 day terms. This allows such international distributor partners to have our products in stock and provide our products to customers on a timely basis. As of December 31, 2017, one international distributor partner accounted for 12% of our outstanding accounts receivable balance.. While we believe we have an adequate basis to ensure that we collect our accounts receivable, we cannot provide any assurance that the financial position of customers to whom we have provided payment terms will not change adversely before we receive payment. In the event that there is a default by any of the customers to whom we have provided credit terms, we may recognize a bad debt charge in our general and administrative expenses. If this bad debt charge is material, it could negatively affect our future results of operations, cash flows and our stock price.. Additionally, in the event of deterioration of general business conditions or the availability of credit, the financial strength and stability of our customers and potential customers may deteriorate over time, which may cause them to cancel or delay their purchase of our products. In addition, we may be subject to increased risk of non-payment of our accounts receivables. We may also be adversely affected by bankruptcies or other business failures of our customers and potential customers. A significant delay in the collection of funds or a reduction of funds collected may impact our liquidity or result in bad debts.. We are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar and foreign currencies.. Foreign currency fluctuations could result in volatility of our revenue. We do not actively hedge our exposure to currency rate fluctuations. While we transact business primarily in U.S. Dollars, and a significant proportion of our revenue is denominated in U.S. Dollars, a portion of our costs and revenue is denominated in other currencies, such as the Euro, Japanese Yen, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, British Pound and Swiss Francs. As a result, changes in the exchange rates of these currencies to the U.S. Dollar will affect our results from operations. For example, in 2017 the U.S. Dollar devalued against the Euro and Australian dollar by approximately 12% and 8% respectively, which had a significant positive foreign exchange impact on our revenue - both from a re-measurement gain upon the conversion of our Euro and Australian dollar denominated revenue as well as the additional positive revenue impact due to the effective price decrease for the local customers importing our U.S. Dollar denominated systems into Europe and Australia. The U.S. Dollar also devalued against the Japanese Yen in 2016 which had a negative impact on our international revenue in 2016. Future foreign currency fluctuations could adversely impact and increase the volatility of our revenue, profitability and stock price.. Our ability to effectively compete and generate additional revenue from new and existing products depends upon our ability to distinguish our company and our products from our competitors and their products, and to develop and effectively market new and existing products. Our success is dependent on many factors, including the following:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tspeed of new and innovative product development; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teffective strategy and execution of new product launches; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tidentification and development of clinical support for new indications of our existing products; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct performance; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct pricing; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tquality of customer support; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelopment of successful distribution channels, both domestically and internationally; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tintellectual property protection.. To compete effectively, we have to demonstrate that our new and existing products are attractive alternatives to other devices and treatments, by differentiating our products on the basis of such factors as innovation, performance, brand name, service, and price. This is difficult to do, especially in a crowded aesthetic market. Some of our competitors have newer or different products and more established customer relationships than we do, which could inhibit our market penetration efforts. For example, we have encountered, and expect to continue to encounter, situations where, due to pre-existing relationships, potential customers decided to purchase additional products from our competitors. Potential customers also may need to recoup the cost of products that they have already purchased from our competitors and may decide not to purchase our products, or to delay such purchases. If we are unable to increase our market penetration or compete effectively, our revenue and profitability will be adversely impacted.. 28. Table of Contents. We compete against companies that offer alternative solutions to our products, or have greater resources, a larger installed base of customers and broader product offerings than ours. In addition, increased consolidation in our industry may lead to increased competition. If we are not able to effectively compete with these companies, it may harm our business.. The medical technology and aesthetic product markets are highly competitive and dynamic and are characterized by rapid and substantial technology development and product innovations. Our products compete against conventional non-energy-based treatments, such as electrolysis, Botox and collagen injections, chemical peels, microdermabrasion and sclerotherapy. Our products also compete against laser and other energy-based products offered by public companies. Further, other companies could introduce new products that are in direct competition with our products. Competition with these companies could result in reduced selling prices, reduced profit margins and loss of market share, any of which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Recently, there has been consolidation in the aesthetic industry leading to companies combining their resources, which increases competition and could result in increased downward pressure on our product prices. For example, Allergan acquired Zeltiq in April 2017, Hologic acquired Cynosure in March 2017, XIO Group acquired Lumenis in September 2015, and Valeant acquired Solta in January 2014. These consolidations have resulted in increased competition and pricing pressure, as the newly-combined entities have greater financial resources, deeper sales channels and greater pricing flexibility than we do. Rumored or actual consolidation of our partners and competitors will likely cause uncertainty and disruption to our business and can cause our stock price to fluctuate.. The energy-based aesthetic market faces competition from non-energy-based medical products, such as Botox and collagen injections. Other alternatives to the use of our products include electrolysis, a procedure involving the application of electric current to eliminate hair follicles, and chemical peels. We may also face competition from manufacturers of pharmaceutical and other products that have not yet been developed.. If there is not sufficient consumer demand for the procedures performed with our products, practitioner demand for our products could be inhibited, resulting in unfavorable operating results and reduced growth potential.. Continued expansion of the global market for laser and other-energy-based aesthetic procedures is a material assumption of our business strategy. Most procedures performed using our products are elective procedures not reimbursable through government or private health insurance, with the costs borne by the patient. The decision to utilize our products may therefore be influenced by a number of factors, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconsumer disposable income and access to consumer credit, which as a result of the unstable economy, may have been significantly impacted; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost, safety and effectiveness of alternative treatments, including treatments which are not based upon laser or other energy-based technologies and treatments which use pharmaceutical products; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe success of our sales and marketing efforts; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe education of our customers and patients on the benefits and uses of our products, compared to competitors’ products and technologies.. If, as a result of these factors, there is not sufficient demand for the procedures performed with our products, practitioner demand for our products could be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, revenue and result of operations.. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it could result in enforcement action by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, federal and state agencies or international regulatory bodies.. The FDA, state authorities and international regulatory bodies have broad enforcement powers. If we fail to comply with any U.S. law or any of the applicable regulatory requirements of the FDA, or federal or state agencies, or one of the international regulatory bodies, it could result in enforcement action by the agencies, which may include any of the following sanctions:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twarning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trepair, replacement, refund, recall or seizure of our products; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trefusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twithdrawing 510(k) clearance or pre-market approvals that have already been granted; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcriminal prosecution.. 29. Table of Contents. If we fail to obtain or maintain necessary FDA clearances for our products and indications, if clearances for future products and indications are delayed or not issued, if there are federal or state level regulatory changes or if we are found to have violated applicable FDA marketing rules, our commercial operations would be harmed.. Our products are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. by the FDA for manufacturing, labeling, sale, promotion, distribution and shipping. Before a new medical device, or a new use of or labeling claim for an existing product, can be marketed in the U.S., it must first receive either 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. Either process can be expensive and lengthy. In the event that we do not obtain FDA clearances or approvals for our products, our ability to market and sell them in the U.S. and revenue derived from the U.S. market may be adversely affected.. Medical devices may be marketed in the U.S. only for the indications for which they are approved or cleared by the FDA. If we fail to comply with these regulations, it could result in enforcement action by the FDA which could lead to such consequences as warning letters, adverse publicity, criminal enforcement action and/or third-party civil litigation, each of which could adversely affect us.. We have obtained 510(k) clearance for the indications for which we market our products. However, our clearances can be revoked if safety or effectiveness problems develop. We also are subject to Medical Device Reporting regulations, which require us to report to the FDA if our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or malfunction in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Our products are also subject to state regulations, which, in many instances, change frequently. Changes in state regulations may impede sales. For example, federal regulations allow our products to be sold to, or on the order of, “licensed practitioners,” as determined on a state-by-state basis. As a result, in some states, non-physicians may legally purchase our products. However, a state could change its regulations at any time, thereby prohibiting sales to particular types of end users. We cannot predict the impact or effect of future legislation or regulations at the federal or state levels.. Federal regulatory reforms and changes occurring at the FDA could adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably and financial condition.. From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the clearance or approval, manufacture and marketing of a device. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Changes in FDA regulations may lengthen the regulatory approval process for medical devices and require additional clinical data to support regulatory clearance for the sale and marketing of our new products. In addition, it may require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or use, or other measures after the introduction of our products to market. Either of these changes lengthen the duration to market, increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products, or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products.. If we fail to comply with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation and laser performance standards, our manufacturing operations could be halted, and our business would suffer.. We are currently required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (the “QSR”). The QSR is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. Because our products involve the use of lasers, our products also are covered by a performance standard for lasers set forth in FDA regulations. The laser performance standard imposes specific record-keeping, reporting, product testing and product labeling requirements. These requirements include affixing warning labels to laser products, as well as incorporating certain safety features in the design of laser products.. The FDA enforces the QSR and laser performance standards through periodic unannounced inspections. We have had multiple quality system audits by the FDA, our Notified Body, and other foreign regulatory agencies, with the most recent inspection by the FDA occurring in March, 2017. There were no significant findings or observations as a result of this audit. Failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection or our failure to comply with applicable laser performance standards could result in enforcement actions, including a public warning letter, a shutdown of our manufacturing operations, a recall of our products, civil or criminal penalties, or other sanctions, such as those described in the preceding paragraph, which would cause our sales and business to suffer.. We are a sponsor of Biomedical Research. As such, we are also subject to FDA regulations relating to the design and conduct of clinical trials. We are subject to unannounced BIMO audits, with the most recent inspection by FDA occurring over 5 days in August 2016. There were no significant findings and only two observations as a result of this audit. Our responses to these observations were accepted by the FDA. Failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse BIMO inspection or our failure to comply with Good Clinical Practices could result in us no longer being able to sponsor Biomedical Research, the reversal of 510(k) clearances previously granted based on the results of clinical trials conducted to gain clinical data to support those 510(k) clearances, or enforcement actions, including a public warning letter, civil or criminal penalties, or other sanctions, such as those described in the preceding paragraph, which would cause our sales and business to suffer.. 30. Table of Contents. If we modify one of our FDA-approved devices, we may need to seek re-approval, which, if not granted, would prevent us from selling our modified products or cause us to redesign our products.. Any modifications to an FDA-cleared device that would significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new 510(k) clearance or possibly a pre-market approval. We may not be able to obtain additional 510(k) clearance or pre-market approvals for new products or for modifications to, or additional indications for, our existing products in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining future clearance would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our revenue and future profitability.. We have made modifications to our devices in the past and may make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearance or approvals. If the FDA disagrees, and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications, we may be required to recall and to stop marketing the modified devices, which could harm our operating results and require us to redesign our products.. We may be unable to obtain or maintain international regulatory qualifications or approvals for our current or future products and indications, which could harm our business.. Sales of our products outside the U.S. are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. In addition, exports of medical devices from the U.S. are regulated by the FDA. Complying with international regulatory requirements can be an expensive and time-consuming process and approval is not certain. The time required for obtaining clearance or approvals, if required by other countries, may be longer than that required for FDA clearance or approvals, and requirements for such clearances or approvals may significantly differ from FDA requirements. We may be unable to obtain or maintain regulatory qualifications, clearances or approvals in other countries. We may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and in maintaining foreign regulatory approvals or qualifications. If we experience delays in receiving necessary qualifications, clearances or approvals to market our products outside the U.S., or if we fail to receive those qualifications, clearances or approvals, we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets effectively, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and growth strategy.. Any defects in the design, material or workmanship of our products may not be discovered prior to shipment to customers, which could materially increase our expenses, adversely impact profitability and harm our business.. The design of our products is complex. To manufacture them successfully, we must procure quality components and employ individuals with a significant degree of technical expertise. If our designs are defective, or the material components used in our products are subject to wearing out, or if suppliers fail to deliver components to specification, or if our employees fail to properly assemble, test and package our products, the reliability and performance of our products will be adversely impacted.. If our products contain defects that cannot be repaired easily, inexpensively, or on a timely basis, we may experience:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdamage to our brand reputation; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of customer orders and delay in order fulfillment; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased costs due to product repair or replacement; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinability to attract new customers; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiversion of resources from our manufacturing and research and development departments into our service department; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlegal action.. The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing could materially increase expenses, adversely impact profitability and harm our business.. Product liability suits could be brought against us due to a defective design, material or workmanship or misuse of our products and could result in expensive and time-consuming litigation, payment of substantial damages and an increase in our insurance rates.. If our products are defectively designed, manufactured or labeled, contain defective components or are misused, we may become subject to substantial and costly litigation by our customers or their patients. Misusing our products or failing to adhere to operating guidelines could cause significant eye and skin damage, and underlying tissue damage. In addition, if our operating guidelines are found to be inadequate, we may be subject to liability. We have been involved, and may in the future be involved, in litigation related to the use of our products. Product liability claims could divert management’s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and result in sizable damage awards against us. We may not have sufficient insurance coverage for all future claims. We may not be able to obtain insurance in amounts or scope sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against all potential liabilities. Any product liability claims brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing continuing coverage, could harm our reputation in the industry and could reduce product sales. In addition, we historically experienced steep increases in our product liability insurance premiums as a percentage of revenue. If our premiums continue to rise, we may no longer be able to afford adequate insurance coverage.. 31. Table of Contents. We currently are involved in litigation that could adversely affect our business and financial results, divert management’s attention from our business, and subject us to significant liabilities.. As described under “Note 12- Commitments and Contingencies - Contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are involved in various litigation, which may adversely affect our financial condition and may require us to devote significant resources to our defense of these claims.. Such litigation involves certain non-compete provisions of an agreement an employee of ours was a party to while employed by a competitor. The competitor alleges causes of action for breach of contract (against the employee) and intentional interference with contractual relations (Cutera). The Company believes the non-compete provisions are unenforceable. The competitor has also threatened to file a complaint against another current employee based in Arizona. As of March 26, 2018, we are involved in several lawsuits worldwide, with most of the claims in various federal or state courts throughout the United States. The complaints generally seek damages and other relief based on theories of breach of express and implied warranties, fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation/concealment, unjust enrichment, and violations of various state consumer protection statutes.. Although we are defending these matters vigorously, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or other litigation matter, and there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any litigation or proceeding. Litigation may have a material adverse effect on us because of potential adverse outcomes, defense costs, the diversion of our management's resources, availability of insurance coverage and other factors.. If customers are not trained and/or our products are used by non-physicians, it could result in product misuse and adverse treatment outcomes, which could harm our reputation, result in product liability litigation, distract management and result in additional costs, all of which could harm our business.. Because we do not require training for users of our products, and sell our products at times to non-physicians, there exists an increased potential for misuse of our products, which could harm our reputation and our business. U.S. federal regulations allow us to sell our products to or on the order of “licensed practitioners.” The definition of “licensed practitioners” varies from state to state. As a result, our products may be purchased or operated by physicians with varying levels of training, and in many states, by non-physicians, including nurse practitioners, chiropractors and technicians. Outside the U.S., many jurisdictions do not require specific qualifications or training for purchasers or operators of our products. We do not supervise the procedures performed with our products, nor do we require that direct medical supervision occur. We and our distributors generally offer but do not require product training to the purchasers or operators of our products. In addition, we sometimes sell our systems to companies that rent our systems to third parties and that provide a technician to perform the procedures. The lack of training and the purchase and use of our products by non-physicians may result in product misuse and adverse treatment outcomes, which could harm our reputation and our business, and, in the event these result in product liability litigation, distract management and subject us to liability, including legal expenses.. Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our marketable investments or impair our liquidity.. The primary objective of most of our investment activities is to preserve principal. To achieve this objective, we invest our excess cash primarily in money market funds and in highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies and U.S. municipalities, in commercial paper and high grade corporate debt. As of December 31, 2017, our balance in marketable investments was $21.7 million. The longer the duration of a security, the more susceptible it is to changes in market interest rates and bond yields. As yields increase, those securities with a lower yield-at-cost show a mark-to-market unrealized loss. For example, assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the fair value of our total investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017 would have potentially decreased by approximately $120,000, resulting in an unrealized loss that would subsequently adversely impact our earnings. As a result, changes in the market interest rates will affect our future net income (loss).. 32. Table of Contents. Our manufacturing operations are dependent upon third-party suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations, which could harm our business.. Many of the components and materials that comprise our products are currently manufactured by a limited number of suppliers. A supply interruption or an increase in demand beyond our current suppliers’ capabilities could harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is identified and qualified. Our reliance on these suppliers subjects us to a number of risks that could harm our business, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinterruption of supply resulting from modifications to or discontinuation of a supplier’s operations; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelays in product shipments resulting from uncorrected defects, reliability issues or a supplier’s variation in a component; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlack of long-term supply arrangements for key components with our suppliers; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinability to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner, or on reasonable terms; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinability to redesign one or more components in our systems in the event that a supplier discontinues manufacturing such components and we are unable to source it from other suppliers on reasonable terms; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulty locating and qualifying alternative suppliers for our components in a timely manner; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduction delays related to the evaluation and testing of products from alternative suppliers and corresponding regulatory qualifications; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelay in supplier deliveries.. Any interruption in the supply of components or materials, or our inability to obtain substitute components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business.. Our annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future, which may cause our share price to decline.. Our net sales, expenses and operating results may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter for several reasons, including, without limitation:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability of our sales force to effectively market and promote our products, and the extent to which those products gain market acceptance; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe existence and timing of any product approvals or changes; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe rate and size of expenditures incurred on our clinical, manufacturing, sales, marketing and product development efforts; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to obtain and retain personnel; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of key components, materials and contract services, which depends on our ability to forecast sales, among other things; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinvestigations of our business and business-related activities by regulatory or other governmental authorities; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvariations in timing and quantity of product orders; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttemporary manufacturing interruptions or disruptions; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing and success of new product and new market introductions, as well as delays in obtaining domestic or foreign regulatory approvals for such introductions; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased competition, patent expirations or new technologies or treatments; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct recalls or safety alerts; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlitigation, including product liability, patent, employment, securities class action, stockholder derivative, general commercial and other lawsuits; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontinued volatility in the global market and worldwide economic conditions, including, but not limited to, the impact of events such as Brexit; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in tax laws, including changes due to Brexit, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe financial health of our customers and their ability to purchase our products in the current economic environment; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother unusual or non-operating expenses, such as expenses related to mergers or acquisitions, may cause operating result variations; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur ability to correctly estimate or control our future operating expenses, which could lead to cash shortfalls.. As a result of any of these factors, our consolidated results of operations may fluctuate significantly, which may in turn cause our share price to fluctuate.. Risks related to the reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for supply may adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales.. We maintain manufacturing operations at our facility in Brisbane, California, and purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing these products from numerous suppliers in various countries. Any problem affecting a supplier (whether due to external or internal causes) could have a negative impact on us.. In a few limited cases, specific components and raw materials are purchased from primary or main suppliers (or in some cases, a single supplier) for reasons related to quality assurance, cost-effectiveness ratio and availability. While we work closely with our suppliers to ensure supply continuity, we cannot guarantee that our efforts will always be successful. Moreover, due to strict standards and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of our products, we may not be able to quickly locate new supply sources in response to a supply reduction or interruption, with negative effects on our ability to manufacture our products effectively and in a timely fashion.. 33. Table of Contents. Our manufacturing is currently conducted at a single site, and the occurrence of a catastrophic disaster or other similar event could cause damage to our facilities and equipment, which might require us to cease or curtail operations.. We are vulnerable to damage from various types of disasters, including fires, earthquakes, terrorist acts, floods, power losses, communications failures and similar events. If any such disaster were to occur, we may not be able to operate our business at our facility in Brisbane, California. Our manufacturing facilities require FDA approval, which could result in significant delays before we could manufacture products from a replacement facility. The insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions. Therefore, any such catastrophe could seriously harm our business and consolidated results of operations.. Intellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection for some or all of our products, which may permit third parties to compete against us more effectively.. We rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology and products. At December 31, 2017, we had 33 issued U.S. patents. Some of our components, such as our laser module, electronic control system and high-voltage electronics, are not, and in the future may not be, protected by patents. Additionally, our patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that will be advantageous to us. Any patents we obtain may be challenged, invalidated or legally circumvented by third parties. Consequently, competitors could market products and use manufacturing processes that are substantially similar to, or superior to, ours. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by consultants, vendors, former employees or current employees, despite the existence generally of confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be effective. Moreover, the laws of many foreign countries will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.. The absence of complete intellectual property protection exposes us to a greater risk of direct competition. Competitors could purchase one of our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, design around our protected technology, or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights. If our intellectual property is not adequately protected against competitors’ products and methods, our competitive position and our business could be adversely affected.. We may be involved in future costly intellectual property litigation, which could impact our future business and financial performance.. Our competitors or other patent holders may assert that our present or future products and the methods we employ are covered by their patents. In addition, we do not know whether our competitors own or will obtain patents that they may claim prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, sell or import our products. Although we may seek to resolve any potential future claims or actions, we may not be able to do so on reasonable terms, or at all. If, following a successful third-party action for infringement, we cannot obtain a license or redesign our products, we may have to stop manufacturing and selling the applicable products and our business would suffer as a result. In addition, a court could require us to pay substantial damages, and prohibit us from using technologies essential to our products, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. We may become involved in litigation not only as a result of alleged infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights but also to protect our own intellectual property. For example, we have been, and may hereafter become, involved in litigation to protect the trademark rights associated with our company name or the names of our products. Infringement and other intellectual property claims, with or without merit, can be expensive and time-consuming to litigate, and could divert management’s attention from our core business.. The expense and potential unavailability of insurance coverage for our customers could adversely affect our ability to sell our products, and therefore adversely affect our financial condition.. Some of our customers and prospective customers have had difficulty procuring or maintaining liability insurance to cover their operation and use of our products. Medical malpractice carriers are withdrawing coverage in certain states or substantially increasing premiums. If this trend continues or worsens, our customers may discontinue using our products and potential customers may opt against purchasing laser-based products due to the cost or inability to procure insurance coverage. The unavailability of insurance coverage for our customers and prospects could adversely affect our ability to sell our products, and that could harm our financial condition.. From time to time we may become subject to income tax audits or similar proceedings, and as a result we may incur additional costs and expenses or owe additional taxes, interest and penalties that may negatively impact our operating results.. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions where we operate through a subsidiary, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Spain, Switzerland, Italy and the United Kingdom. Our determination of our tax liability is subject to review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities.. 34. Table of Contents. We are currently under tax examination in Germany (“Cutera GmbH”) for tax years ended December 31, 2011 through 2013 and are uncertain of the potential outcome of this examination. We underwent audits for our California sales and use tax returns for the period July 2013 through June 2016, and Canadian goods and services tax and harmonized sales tax returns for the period January 2013 to July 2015. Although these audits resulted in immaterial adjustments, the final timing and resolution of any future tax examinations are subject to significant uncertainty and could result in our having to pay amounts to the applicable tax authority in order to resolve examination of our tax positions. An increase or decrease of tax related to tax examination resolution could result in a change in our income tax accrual and could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.. We may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. tax laws, importation taxes and other changes that may be imposed by the current administration.. We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Tax rates in these jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic and/or political conditions. A number of other factors may also impact our future effective tax rate including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired intangibles and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in availability of tax credits, tax holidays, and tax deductions; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in share-based compensation; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles.. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“2017 Tax Act”). The 2017 Tax Act significantly changed the existing U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, lowering the corporate tax rate, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time deemed repatriation toll tax on cumulative undistributed foreign earnings, for which we have not previously provided U.S. taxes. Given the timing, scope, and magnitude of the changes enacted by the 2017 Tax Act, along with on-going implementation efforts, guidance, and other developments from U.S. regulatory and standard-setting bodies, the completion of the accounting for certain tax items included in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, that have been reported as provisional, or where no estimate of the impact was provided as a result of us not having the necessary information, may be subject to material change. Any significant changes to our future effective tax rate, including final resolution of provisional amounts relating to effects of the 2017 Tax Act, may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.. In the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”), for example, has the potential to significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States. Due to subsequent legislative amendments the excise tax has been suspended for the period January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019, and, absent further legislative action, will be reinstated starting January 1, 2020, which may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or cash flows.. Any acquisitions that we make could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.. While we from time to time evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations, we have no present understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions or collaborative projects We may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates or strategic partners, or successfully negotiate, finance or integrate any businesses, products or technologies that we acquire.. We have limited experience as a team with acquiring companies and products. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition and management of any collaborative project may divert management’s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations and we may incur significant legal, accounting and banking fees in connection with such a transaction. Acquisitions could diminish our available cash balances for other uses, result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, and restructuring charges. Also, the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions or investments may not materialize and could result in an impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived assets, similar to the $650,000 charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to an acquisition completed in 2012.. 35. Table of Contents. Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business and our financial condition or results.. Our failure to comply with rules relating to bribery, foreign corrupt practices, and privacy and security laws may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation and business operations.. Our business is subject to regulation and oversight worldwide including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FCPA, which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity;  \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe UK Bribery Act, which prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors; and bribery provisions contained in the German Criminal Code, which, pursuant to draft legislation being prepared by the German government, may make the corruption and corruptibility of physicians in private practice and other healthcare professionals a criminal offense; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act , which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tanalogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above laws, such as state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.. The risk of being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our relationships with practitioners and thought leaders worldwide, some of whom recommend, purchase and/or use our devices, as well as our sales agents and distributors, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. We are also exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors, independent sales agents and distributors may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. While we have policies and procedures in place prohibiting such activity, misconduct by these parties could include, among other infractions or violations, intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or unauthorized activity that violates FDA regulations, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA, manufacturing standards, laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data or other commercial or regulatory laws or requirements. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations.. There are similar laws and regulations applicable to us outside the United States, all of which are subject to evolving interpretations. Global enforcement of anti-corruption laws, including but not limited to the UK Bribery Act, the Brazil Clean Companies Act, and continued enforcement in the Europe, Middle East and Asia Pacific has increased substantially in recent years, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by governmental agencies, and assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals. Our operations create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors because these parties are not always subject to our control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices; however, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities, and could negatively affect our business, reputation, operating results, and financial condition.. While we believe we have a strong culture of compliance and adequate systems of control, and we seek continuously to improve our systems of internal controls and to remedy any weaknesses identified, there can be no assurance that the policies and procedures will be followed at all times or will effectively detect and prevent violations of the applicable laws by one or more of our employees, consultants, agents or partners and, as a result, we may be subject to penalties and material adverse consequences on our business, financial condition or results of operations.. 36. Table of Contents. Anti-takeover provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage a takeover.. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and Delaware law, contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover, and might make it more difficult for an investor to acquire a substantial block of our common stock.. These provisions, as well as Change of Control and Severance Agreements entered into with each of our executive officers and certain key employees, might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or a change in our management, even if such a change would be beneficial to our shareholders. The existence of these provisions could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time. Any of these provisions could, under certain circumstances, depress the market price of our common stock."
