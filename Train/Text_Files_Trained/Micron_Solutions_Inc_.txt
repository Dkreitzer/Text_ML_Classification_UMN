[1] "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS. <U+FEFF>. In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, the following factors should be considered in evaluating the Company and its business.  The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company.  Further, the market price of the Company's common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties described in this \"Risk Factors\" section.  Additional risks and uncertainties that the Company does not presently know or that are currently not deemed significant to the Company's business may also impair the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. The Company's operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of the Company's control.  These factors include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Company's ability to obtain and retain order volumes from customers who represent high proportions of revenue;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Company's ability to maintain the pricing model, offset higher costs with price increases and/or decrease the cost of sales;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe variability of customer delivery requirements and the ability of the Company to anticipate and respond thereto;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of sales of higher margin products and services and the Company's ability to increase such sales;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvolatility in commodity and energy prices and the Company's ability to offset higher costs with price increases;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Company's ability to manage its level of debt which makes the Company sensitive to the effects of economic downturns; the Company's level of debt and provisions in the debt agreements could limit the Company's ability to react to changes in the economy or its industry;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Company's failure to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in its asset based credit and security agreement, including as a result of events beyond its control, which could result in an event of default, and adversely affect the Company's operating results and financial condition;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Company's reliance on revenue from exports and the impact on the Company's financial results due to economic uncertainty, changes in trade policy, tax laws and regulations, or downturns in foreign markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontinued availability of supplies or materials used in manufacturing at competitive prices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe amount and timing of investments in capital equipment, sales and marketing, engineering and information technology resources;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Company's ability to attract and retain employees with the skills to meet the technically complex demands of manufacturing;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tentrance of competitive products and services in the Company's markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Company's ability to develop and implement plans and motivate personnel in the execution of those plans;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Company's ability to protect and retain trade secrets related to the Company's manufacturing processes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse claims relating to the Company's intellectual property and product liability claims affecting the Company's products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadoption of new, or changes in, accounting principles; and passage of new, or changes in regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse regulatory developments specifically healthcare policy changes, environmental and other regulatory changes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe costs inherent with complying with statutes and regulations applicable to public reporting companies, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Company's ability to prevent information systems interruptions, cybersecurity attacks or other disruptions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Company's ability to efficiently integrate future acquisitions and new lines of business that the Company may enter in the future, if any;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Company's ability to maintain compliance with the NYSE American requirements for continued listing of the Company's common stock in which event the Company's securities may be delisted from the NYSE American which could limit investors' ability to effect transactions in the Company's securities and subject the stock to additional trading restrictions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother risks referenced from time to time elsewhere in this report and in the Company's filings with the SEC; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic conditions.. <U+FEFF>. As a response to changes in the competitive or economic environment, the Company may from time to time make certain pricing, delivery, service, technology or marketing decisions, or business or technology acquisitions, or experience fluctuations or reductions in customer orders that could have a material adverse effect on the quarterly and annual results.  Due to all of these factors, the operating results may not meet the expectations of stockholders and investors in any future period and make period to period comparisons difficult.. <U+FEFF>. 6. Table of Contents. The Company is dependent on a limited number of large customers. The loss of, or inability to obtain and retain order volumes from, one or more of these customers, could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial results.. <U+FEFF>. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company had net sales to two customers constituting 17% and 10% of total 2017 net sales. Accounts receivable from these two customers at December 31, 2017 was 13% and 3%, respectively, of the total accounts receivable balance at year end. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company had net sales to two customers constituting 19% and 12%, respectively, of total 2016 net sales. Accounts receivable from these two customers at December 31, 2016 was 26% and 7%, respectively, of the total accounts receivable balance at year end.. <U+FEFF>. Large corporations can change their demand for the Company's products and services with little or no warning making it difficult to forecast beyond the current or next quarter. In the case of precious metal plating, customer purchase arrangements take into account the fluctuating price of precious metals.. <U+FEFF>. The loss of, or significant reduction in order volume, from one or more of these customers, could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial results.. <U+FEFF>. The Company competes globally, with a large portion of its revenue derived from exports.  Economic uncertainty or downturns in foreign markets could result in variability or have an adverse effect on the Company's financial results.. <U+FEFF>. While some risks exist in foreign markets, the Company's customers have historically been based in stable regions.  Approximately 42% of the Company's revenue is derived from exports. To reduce the risks associated with foreign shipments and currency exchange fluctuations, the title to most of the products are transferred to the customers when shipped.  The Company also has agreements with certain foreign customers to hold inventory at customer locations where revenue is recognized when the product is consumed by the customer. Payment for all product is required in U.S. Dollars.  Additionally, the strength of the U.S. Dollar could affect the demand for the Company's products, or the timing of orders.  This uncertainty could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial results.. <U+FEFF>. In June 2016, the United Kingdom (the \"U.K.\") held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (the \"E.U.\"), commonly referred to as \"Brexit\".  On March 29, 2017, the U.K. formally notified the E.U. of its intentions to withdraw pursuant to the Lisbon Treaty.  The uncertainty surrounding the negotiation of the terms of the U.K.'s withdrawal and its consequences may create global economic uncertainty, or disrupt trade between the U.K. and the E.U.  This uncertainty may cause the Company's customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budget which could adversely affect the Company's financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. Adverse developments in U.S. government trade policy and legislation, the imposition of tariffs or changes in diplomatic relations with countries in which our customers are located or conduct business may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. The 2016 presidential and 2016 and 2018 congressional elections in the United States could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulations and monetary, tax and trade policy, among other things.  Potential changes in U.S. government trade policy and legislation, withdrawal from or modification of international trade agreements, the imposition of additional tariffs on goods or other restrictions on trade and any changes in diplomatic relations with countries in which our customers are located or in which they conduct business may adversely affect our customers and, as a result, could materially affect our operating results.. <U+FEFF>. Quarter to quarter variables, such as customer mix and profitability by product line, can be expected to result in fluctuations in quarterly results and make quarter to quarter comparisons difficult.. <U+FEFF>. The Company is a contract manufacturing organization providing components to a wide array of industries and supplying OEM's of various sizes up to and including Fortune 500 companies.  As a result of the diversity of components and the Company's reliance on large OEM's, who can change their demand with little or no notice, the Company will continue to see fluctuations in quarterly revenue and earnings, which could make quarter to quarter and year over year comparisons difficult.. <U+FEFF>. The Company's top five customers, comprised 49% of sales in 2017 and 51% of sales in 2016.  As the Company continues to diversify its revenue base across all its product lines, the broader customer mix results in additional variables which can affect operating results, product mix, product line gross margins and customer ordering patterns.. <U+FEFF>. 7. Table of Contents. If the Company is unable to keep up with rapid technological changes, the processes or services it offers, or products it manufactures, may become obsolete or if the Company is no longer able to effectively manufacture, market and distribute these products, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. The medical device industry is characterized by continual technological change.  Although the Company attempts to expand technological capabilities in order to remain competitive, the Company may be unable to effectively develop and market competitive products, processes and services, or be able to meet the manufacturing needs related to new discoveries or developments by others, on a timely basis. This may make the Company's processes, products or services obsolete or uneconomical.  Any substantial technological advance that eliminates one or more of the Company's product lines could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results.  The Company generally does not receive purchase volume commitments extending beyond several months. Large corporations can shift focus away from a need for the Company's products and services with little or no warning. Additionally, should any of the Company's large OEM customers decide to vertically integrate the manufacturing of a product line, or chose to limit the number of qualified suppliers, the Company's operating results may be adversely impacted.  If the Company cannot compete effectively in the marketplace, the Company's future prospects and financial results may be adversely impacted.. <U+FEFF>. The Company's dependence on large OEM customers, which can change demand on short notice, adds to the unpredictability of quarterly sales and earnings.. <U+FEFF>. The Company's large OEM customers are not required to have purchase volume commitments extending beyond several months and often lack dependable long-term forecasts. In addition, the Company's large OEM customers may change their demand schedule, either up or down, within a relatively short time horizon.  Further, large OEM customers may choose to develop the capability of producing their own products. In addition, new customers may experience development delays, such as delays in FDA approvals, marketing delays in the development of sales channels or inadequate financing, any of which may delay the launch of new products and therefore may affect the timing of sales.. <U+FEFF>. The Company's quarterly results have in the past and can be expected in the future to vary due to changes in demand within a quarter from large OEM customers. These changes in demand may also result in the Company incurring additional working capital costs and increased manufacturing unit cost due to these short-term fluctuations.  The expense levels and inventory, to a large extent, are based on shipment expectations in the quarter.  If sales levels fall below these expectations, through a delay in orders or otherwise, operating results are likely to be adversely affected.  An inability to accurately predict customer requirements makes cost-saving measures more difficult to implement.. <U+FEFF>. Although the Company seeks to leverage its demonstrated product quality and expertise to expand its customer base and lessen its dependence on a few large customers, it can provide no assurance that it will be able to materially alter this dependency in the immediate future, if at all.. <U+FEFF>. The failure to make timely payments on our asset based credit and security agreement or to comply with financial and other covenants contained therein, including as a result of events beyond the Company's control, could result in an event of default, which, if incurred, could materially and adversely affect operating results and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. The debt service obligations under the Company's asset based credit and security agreement will require the Company to use a portion of its operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness instead of for other corporate purposes, including funding future expansion of its business, acquisitions, and ongoing capital expenditures, which could impede growth.  The asset based credit and security agreement contains covenants that relate to various matters including certain financial covenants, prohibitions on further borrowings and security interests, merger or consolidation, acquisitions, guarantees, sales of assets other than in the normal course of business, leasing and payment of dividends. The Company's ability to make payments on the indebtedness depends on the ability to generate cash.    Failure to generate sufficient cash flow may result in a violation of financial covenants and default under the Company's debt agreements, and make it more difficult to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable, or at all. Management cannot assure that the Company's future cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under the outstanding debt instruments, either upon maturity or upon an event of default, or that the Company would be able to extend, refinance or restructure the payments on those debt instruments.. <U+FEFF>. The level of debt makes the Company more sensitive to the effects of economic downturns; the level of debt and provisions in the debt agreements could limit the Company's ability to react to changes in the economy or industry.. <U+FEFF>. The level of debt makes the Company more vulnerable to changes in the results of operations. The Company's level of debt could have other negative consequences, including the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tLimiting the Company's ability to borrow money or sell stock for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other general corporate purposes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tLimiting the Company's flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in operations, business or the industries in which the Company competes; and. 8. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tLeverage may place the Company at a competitive disadvantage by limiting its ability to invest in the business or in further research and development.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, the Company's asset based credit and security agreement contains covenants that limit the flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the business and industry, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness, making investments, granting liens and merging or consolidating with other companies. Complying with these covenants may impair the Company's ability to finance the future operations or capital needs or to engage in other favorable business activities.. <U+FEFF>. The Company may from time to time assess alternate ways to generate value for shareholders, including reviewing opportunities that may lead to acquisitions, dispositions or other strategic that may disrupt the business and divert management's attention, cause the Company to incur additional costs, debt or issue equity securities and adversely impact its results of operations and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. The Company may periodically assess alternate ways to generate value for shareholders, including reviewing opportunities that may lead to acquisitions, dispositions or other strategic transactions.   It also may choose to invest in the development, either alone or with a strategic customer, of products or technologies from time to time.    Such activities may divert management's attention, increase short term costs, require capital expenditures or result in an inability to realize the expected benefits from such activities.  Any acquisitions will require the assimilation of the operations, products and personnel of the acquired businesses or products and the training and motivation of employees and exposure to unexpected liabilities of the acquired company. The Company also may have to, or choose to, incur additional costs for experts and other advisors, incur debt or issue equity securities to investigate and/or to pay for any future acquisitions, dispositions or other strategic transactions. Financing for such activities may not be available to the Company or may be on terms that involve covenants and financial ratios that may restrict the Company's ability to operate its business. The issuance of common stock, preferred stock or other equity securities in connection with an acquisition or other business opportunity could be dilutive to the stockholders' holdings.  The Company cannot give any assurance that any such acquisitions, dispositions or other strategic transactions will not adversely impact our operating results or ultimately become profitable.  The Company is not currently party to any agreements, written or oral, for the acquisition or disposition of any company, product or technology.. <U+FEFF>. Medical devices are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing, labeling and marketing of such products and failure to comply with such regulations may adversely impact the Company's operations and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. The medical device components the Company manufactures for its machining customers are subject to regulation by the FDA in the United States and other governmental authorities internationally. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming for the Company's customers and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all. Any such approvals may delay the Company's ability to commence production of a new or modified product. Under FDA regulations such products and the Company's manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with the quality system and medical device reporting regulations and other requirements. If the Company fails to fully comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the Company or its customers may be subject to a range of sanctions, including warning letters, product recalls and the suspension of product manufacturing, monetary fines and criminal prosecution.. <U+FEFF>. Economic uncertainty, as well as impact of healthcare reform legislation, may reduce patient demand for knee or other joint replacement procedures.  If there is not sufficient patient demand for the procedures for which orthopedic implant products are used, customer demand for the Company's orthopedic implant components and instruments would likely drop, and its business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.. <U+FEFF>. The orthopedics industry in which the Company's machining customers operate is vulnerable to economic trends and the impact of healthcare reform legislation. If joint replacement procedures are deemed to be elective procedures, the cost of the procedure may not be fully covered by or reimbursable through government, including Medicare or Medicaid, or private health insurance. In times of economic uncertainty or recession, individuals may reduce the amount of money that they spend on deferrable medical procedures, including joint replacement procedures.  Economic downturns in the United States and international markets could have an adverse effect on demand for the Company's orthopedic implant components and instruments.  In addition, these customers may be impacted by current or future executive orders and legislative actions impacting healthcare reform.. <U+FEFF>. Failure to comply with Quality System Regulations or industry standards could result in a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. The Company's Quality Management System complies with the requirements of ISO 13485:2003 and ISO 9001:2008. In addition the Company has registered its manufacturing facilities under ITAR and with the FDA.  If the Company is not able to comply with the Company's Quality Management System or industry-defined standards, it may not be able to fill customer orders to the satisfaction of its customers.  Failure to produce products compliant with these standards could lead to a loss of customers which would have an adverse impact on the Company's business and results of operations. Violations of the ITAR, FDA and other regulations may subject the Company to significant fines or penalties, which could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations.  The. 9. Table of Contents. Company is preparing for the changes in ISO Quality Standards which become effective in 2018 and expects to maintain and enhance its quality system.  It's inability to do so may adversely impact the Company's results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. If trade secrets are not kept confidential, the secrets may be used by others to compete against the Company.. <U+FEFF>. The Company relies on trade secrets to protect its proprietary processes and there are no assurances that others will not independently develop or acquire substantially equivalent technologies or otherwise gain access to the proprietary process.  The meaningful protection of such proprietary technology cannot be guaranteed.  The Company relies on confidentiality agreements with its employees.  Remedies for any breach by a party to these confidentiality agreements may not be adequate to prevent such actions.  Failure to maintain trade secret protection, for any reason, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.. <U+FEFF>. The Company is subject to stringent environmental regulations.. <U+FEFF>. The Company's manufacturing operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local requirements governing the protection of the environment.  These environmental regulations include those related to the use, storage, handling, discharge and disposal of toxic or otherwise hazardous materials used in or resulting from the Company's manufacturing processes.  Failure to comply with environmental laws could subject the Company to substantial liability or force the Company to significantly change its manufacturing operations.  In addition, under some of these laws and regulations, the Company could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if its properties are contaminated, even if it did not cause the contamination.. <U+FEFF>. A product liability suit could adversely affect the Company's operating results.. <U+FEFF>. The testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of the customer's and Company's medical devices and/or components, including orthopedic implant components and instruments, as well as components for the military and law enforcement industry, entail the inherent risk of liability claims or product recalls. If the Company's customers are involved in a lawsuit, it is possible that the Company would also be named.  Although the Company maintains product liability insurance, coverage may not be adequate. Product liability insurance is expensive, and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, the Company may incur significant legal expenses and damage to the Company's reputation in the event of any such claim regardless of whether the Company is found to be liable. A successful product liability claim or product recall could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, and ability to market the Company's products and services in the future.. <U+FEFF>. The effect of comprehensive U.S. tax reform legislation on the Company, whether adverse or favorable is uncertain.. <U+FEFF>. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law H.R. 1, \"An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018\" (informally titled the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\"). Among a number of significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax rules, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\") reduces the marginal U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, limits the deduction for net interest expense, limits the deduction for net operating losses and eliminates net operating loss carrybacks, modifies or repeals many business deductions and credits, shifts the United States toward a more territorial tax system, and imposes new taxes to combat erosion of the U.S. federal income tax base. The Company's net deferred tax assets and liabilities will be revalued at the newly enacted U.S. corporate rate, and the impact will be recognized in tax expense in the year of enactment.  The Company continues to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on its business.  However, the effect of the Act on the Company and the Company's customers, whether adverse or favorable, is uncertain, and may not become evident for some period of time.. <U+FEFF>. The market price of the Company's common stock is volatile.. The market price of the Company's common stock has in the past been, and may in the future continue to be, volatile.  A variety of events may cause the market price of the Company's common stock to fluctuate significantly, including, but not limited to, quarter to quarter variations in operating results, adverse or positive news reports or public announcements and market conditions within the Company's industry.  Due to the relatively small public float for the Company's common stock, trading of such shares may have a disproportionate effect on the stock price.  Trading in the Company's stock or market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of the Company's common stock.. <U+FEFF>. The Company could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist or hostile stockholders.. <U+FEFF>. The Company could be negatively affected as a result of shareholder activism, which could cause the Company to incur significant expense, hinder execution of its business strategy and impact the trading value of the Company's stock. Shareholder activism, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing in publicly traded companies in recent years.  Shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, requires significant time and attention by management and the Board of Directors, potentially interfering with the Company's ability to execute its strategic plan. Additionally, such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to the Company's future direction, adversely affect its relationships with key executives, customers and other business partners, or make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, the Company has been, and may in. 10. Table of Contents. the future be, required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters. Any of these impacts could materially and adversely affect the Company and its operating results.. <U+FEFF>. The Company could be adversely affected by information systems interruptions, cybersecurity attacks or other disruptions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and result of operations.. <U+FEFF>. We depend upon information technology infrastructure, including network, hardware and software systems to conduct our business.  Despite our implementation of network and other cybersecurity measures, our information technology system and networks could be disrupted or experience a security breach from computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems.  Our security measures may not be adequate to protect against highly targeted sophisticated cyber-attacks, or other improper disclosures of confidential and/or sensitive information.  Additionally, we may have access to confidential or other sensitive information of our customers, which, despite our efforts to protect, may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, or other improper disclosure, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. The Company may be exposed to potential risks relating to internal control over financial reporting.. <U+FEFF>. As required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"SOX\"), the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the Company's internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports, including Form 10-K.  In addition, if a reporting company is an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer (as defined by the Exchange Act), the independent registered public accounting firm auditing a reporting Company's financial statements must also attest to and report on the reporting company's internal control over financial reporting as well as the operating effectiveness of the reporting company's internal control.  The Company was only subject to the management evaluation and review portion of these requirements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The Company's failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of SOX on an ongoing, timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of the Company's financial statements, which in turn could harm the Company's business and negatively impact the trading price of the Company's common stock. In addition, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm the Company's operating results or cause the Company to fail to meet its reporting obligations.. <U+FEFF>. Failure to comply with the listing requirements of the NYSE American could lead to the commencement of delisting proceedings in accordance the NYSE American's Company Guide. Delisting could limit investors' ability to effect transactions in the Company's securities and subject the stock to additional trading restrictions.. <U+FEFF>. The Company's common stock is listed on the NYSE American, a national securities exchange. To maintain such listing, the Company is required to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE American as set forth in its Company Guide. If the Company is unable to maintain the listing of its stock on the NYSE American or another exchange for failure to comply with the continued listing requirements, including timely filing of Exchange Act reports and compliance with the NYSE American's corporate governance requirements, the Company and its security holders could face significant material adverse consequences including a limited availability of market quotations for its stock and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.. <U+FEFF>"
