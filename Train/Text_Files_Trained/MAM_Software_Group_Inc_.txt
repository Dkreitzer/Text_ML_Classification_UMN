[1] "Item 1A. \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk Factors. Our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to a number of risk factors, both those that are known to us and identified below and others that may arise from time to time. These risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those suggested by forward-looking statements in this Report and elsewhere, and may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of these risk factors should occur, moreover, the trading price of our securities could decline, and investors in our securities could lose all or part of their investment in our securities. These risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business.. 7. Risks Related to MAM and Our Business. We may fail to address risks we face as a growing business, which could adversely affect the implementation of our business plan.. We are prone to all of the risks inherent in growing a business.  You should consider the likelihood of our future success to be highly speculative in light of the limited resources, problems, expenses, risks and complications frequently encountered by entities at our current stage of development.. To address these risks, we must, among other things:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timplement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy; \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontinue to develop new products and upgrade our existing products; \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trespond to industry and competitive developments; \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tattract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel; and \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtain equity and debt financing on satisfactory terms and in timely fashion in amounts adequate to implement our business plan and meet our obligations.. We may not be successful in addressing these risks and if we do not, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.. Global market disruptions may adversely affect our business and results of operations.. Disruptions in the global credit and financial markets may include diminished liquidity and credit availability, a decline in economic growth and uncertainty about economic stability. These economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities and could impact our growth expectations as potential and existing customers could delay decisions to purchase or upgrade their systems. We are unable to predict the occurrence and severity of these disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions and their potential impact on our business, which could materially adversely affect us.. Political and economic uncertainty arising from a majority of voters approving a referendum for the United Kingdom to exit the European Union could adversely impact our financial results.. In June 2016, a majority of voters in the UK elected to withdraw from the European Union (E.U.) in a national referendum (also referred to as “Brexit”). Negotiations are expected to commence to determine the future terms of the UK’s relationship with the E.U. MAM UK represents a significant portion of our revenues and profitability. The announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the US dollar against the British pound. During periods of a strengthening dollar, our reported international revenues are reduced because the British pound translates into fewer US dollars. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the UK makes to retain access to European markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Any of the potential effects of Brexit could have unpredictable consequences for credit markets and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial performance.. Financial difficulties or the bankruptcy of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our results.. Our ability to collect our accounts receivable and future sales depends, in part, on the financial strength of our customers. We grant credit, generally without collateral, to our customers. Consequently, we are subject to credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors throughout the UK, Ireland and NA. In the event customers experience financial difficulty, and particularly if bankruptcy results, our profitability may be adversely impacted by our failure to collect our accounts receivable in excess of our estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts. Additionally, our future revenues could be reduced by the loss of a customer due to bankruptcy. Our failure to collect accounts receivable and/or the loss of one or more major customers could have an adverse effect on our net income and financial condition.. 8. We may fail to successfully develop, market and sell our products.. To achieve profitable operations, we, along with our subsidiaries, must continue successfully to improve, market and sell existing products and develop, market and sell new products. Our product development efforts may not be successful. The development of new software products is highly uncertain and subject to a number of significant risks. The development cycle - from inception to installing the software for customers - can be lengthy and uncertain. The ability to market the product is unpredictable and may cause delays. Potential products may appear promising at early stages of development, and yet may not reach the market for a number of reasons.. We may encounter significant financial and operating risks if we grow our business through acquisitions.. As part of our growth strategy, we may seek to acquire or invest in complementary or competitive businesses, products or technologies. The process of integrating acquired assets into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. We may allocate a significant portion of our available working capital to finance all or a portion of the purchase price relating to possible acquisitions. Any future acquisition or investment opportunity may require us to obtain additional financing to complete the transaction. The anticipated benefits of any acquisitions may not be realized. In addition, future acquisitions by us could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial position. Acquisitions also involve other risks, including entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience.. We operate in a highly competitive environment, and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our products that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to decline.. We operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards, changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements. If we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets, our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a decline in our sales that could adversely affect our business and operating results. To compete successfully, we must maintain an innovative research and development effort to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services, effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors, appropriately respond to competitive strategies and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed, used and stored within our markets. If we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands, our competitive position and our financial results could be adversely affected.. The prices we charge for our products may decrease as a result of competition and our revenues could decrease as a result.. We face potential competition from many competitors and increased competition may have a negative impact on our future revenues and financial condition. In addition, there are very large software companies, including Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation and SAP AG which supply ERP and SCM products to our target market of small to medium-sized businesses servicing the automotive aftermarket. There can be no assurance that these companies will not develop or acquire a competitive product or service in the future. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact pricing for both our on-premise enterprise software business and our cloud business, as well as overall demand for our on-premise software product and service offerings, which could reduce our revenues and profitability. Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings, which could put pressure on us to further discount our product or support pricing. Any broad-based change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies.. Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products and services.. Rapid technological advances, changing delivery models and evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure, changing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the industries in which we compete. If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, enhance and improve our product offerings and support services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand, customers may not purchase or subscribe to our software, hardware or cloud offerings or renew software support, hardware support or cloud subscriptions contracts. Renewals of these contracts are important to the growth of our business. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for business opportunities in emerging areas.. 9. We have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our cloud and on-premise products and services, including our SaaS and DaaS and related offerings. Our business may be adversely affected if:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe do not continue to develop and release these or other new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames; \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthere is a delay in market acceptance of a new, enhanced or acquired product line or service; \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthere are changes in IT trends that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our product development efforts; or \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired product lines or services.. We depend on proprietary know-how to develop and protect our technologies and products, which rights may not offer us sufficient protection.. The software industry places considerable importance on obtaining intellectual property protection for new technologies, products and processes. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and enforce protection for products that we develop, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.. We rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. We may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets which could limit our ability to exclusively produce products.. We require our employees, consultants, and parties to collaborative agreements to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships or collaboration with us. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection of our trade secrets or adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information.. We may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at all.. Developing software, cloud and hardware offerings is expensive and the investment in the development of these offerings often involves a long return on investment cycle. An important element of our business strategy is to continue to make meaningful investments in research and development and related product and service opportunities through internal investments. Accelerated product and service introductions and short software and services life cycles may require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by meaningful and sustained revenue increases. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we are not certain as to whether we will receive significant revenues from these investments for several years, if at all.. If we become subject to adverse claims alleging infringement of third-party proprietary rights, we may incur unanticipated costs and our competitive position may suffer.. We are subject to the risk that we are infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. Although we are not aware of any infringement by our technology on the proprietary rights of others and are not currently subject to any legal proceedings involving claimed infringements, we cannot assure that we will not be subject to such third-party claims, litigation or indemnity demands and that these claims will not be successful. If a claim or indemnity demand were to be brought against us, it could result in costly litigation or product shipment delays or force us to stop selling such product or providing such services or to enter into royalty or license agreements.. Our software and information services could contain design defects or errors which could affect our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our products.. Despite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service, our offerings sometimes contain coding or similar errors (commonly referred to as “bugs”) that can impact their function, performance and security, and result in other negative consequences. The detection and correction of any errors in released software or cloud offerings can be time consuming and costly. Errors in our product or services offerings could affect their ability to properly function or operate with other products or services utilized by a customer, could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services, could create security vulnerabilities in our products or services, and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products or services. This includes third-party software products or services incorporated into our own. If we experience errors or delays in releasing our offerings or new versions thereof, our sales could be affected and revenues could decline. Customers rely on our offerings and services to run their businesses and errors in our product or service offerings could expose us to product liability, performance and warranty claims as well as significant harm to our brand and reputation, which could impact our future sales.. 10. If we lose key management or other personnel our business could suffer.. We are highly dependent on the principal members of our management staff. We also rely on consultants and advisors to assist us in formulating our development strategy. Our success also depends upon retaining key management and technical personnel, as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. We may not be successful in retaining our current personnel or hiring and retaining qualified personnel in the future. If we lose the services of any of our management staff or key technical personnel, or if we fail to continue to attract qualified personnel, our ability to acquire, develop or sell products would be adversely affected.. Our management and internal systems might be inadequate to handle our potential growth.. Our success will depend in significant part on the expansion of our operations and the effective management of growth. This growth will place a significant strain on our management and information systems and resources and operational and financial systems and resources. To manage future growth, our management must continue to improve our operational and financial systems and expand, train, retain and manage our employee base. Our management may not be able to manage our growth effectively. If our systems, procedures, controls, and resources are inadequate to support our operations, our expansion would be halted and we could lose our opportunity to gain significant market share. Any inability to manage growth effectively may harm our ability to institute our business plan.. Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, on our network. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, and damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our operating margins, revenues and competitive position.. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our systems.. We have insurance coverage for the services we offer. However, a claim for damages may be made against us regardless of our responsibility for the failure, which could expose us to liability.. We provide business management solutions that we believe are critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses and provide benefits that may be difficult to quantify. Any failure of a customer’s system installed or of the services offered by us could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for the failure. Although we attempt to limit our contractual liability for damages resulting from negligent acts, errors, mistakes or omissions in rendering our services, we cannot assure you that the limitations on liability we include in our agreements will be enforceable in all cases, or that those limitations on liability will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. In the event that the terms and conditions of our contracts which limit our liability are not sufficient, we have insurance coverage. This coverage of approximately $10 million in the aggregate in the UK and in NA insures the business for negligent acts, error or omission, failure of the technology services to perform as intended, and breach of warranties or representations. It also insures the services that we supply including, web services, consulting, analysis, design, installation, training, support, system integration, the manufacture, sale, licensing, distribution or marketing of software, the design and development of code, software and programming and the provision of software applications as a service, rental or lease. However, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that coverage will remain available at acceptable costs. Successful claims brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could seriously harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Even if not successful, large claims against us could result in significant legal and other costs and may be a distraction to our senior management.. 11. Because we have international operations, we will be subject to risks of conducting business in foreign countries.. International operations constitute a significant part of our business, and we are subject to the risks of conducting business in foreign countries, including:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulty in establishing or managing distribution relationships; \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifferent standards for the development, use, packaging and marketing of our products and technologies; \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to locate qualified local employees, partners, distributors and suppliers; \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe potential burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws and trade standards; and \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral geopolitical risks, such as political and economic instability, changes in diplomatic and trade relations, and foreign currency risks and fluctuations.. No assurance can be given that we will be able to positively manage the risks inherent in the conduct of our international operations or that such operations will not have a negative impact on our overall financial operations.. Risks Related to our Common Stock. Our insiders and affiliated parties beneficially own a significant portion of our common stock.. As of the date of hereof, our executive officers, directors and affiliated parties beneficially own approximately 63% of our common stock.  As a result, our executive officers and affiliated parties will have significant influence to:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\telect or defeat the election of our directors; \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tamend or prevent amendment of our certificate of incorporation, as amended, or bylaws; \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teffect or prevent a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction; and \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\taffect the outcome of any other matter submitted to the stockholders for vote. In addition, any sale of a significant amount of our common stock held by our directors and executive officers, or the possibility of such sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  Management’s stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce the price of our common stock or prevent our stockholders from realizing any gains from our common stock.. Additional issuances of securities will dilute your stock ownership and could affect the price of our common stock.. As of September 7, 2018, there were 12,600,479 shares of our common stock issued and 12,595,085 shares of our common stock outstanding. Our certificate of incorporation, as amended, authorizes the issuance of an aggregate of 18,000,000 shares of common stock and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, on such terms and at such prices as our board of directors may determine. These shares are intended to provide us with the necessary flexibility to undertake and complete plans to raise funds if and when needed. In addition, we may pursue acquisitions that could include issuing equity, although we have no current arrangements to do so. Any such issuances of securities would have a dilutive effect on current ownership of MAM stock. The market price of our common stock could fall in response to the sale or issuance of a large number of shares, or the perception that sales of a large number of shares could occur.. The market for our common stock is limited and you may not be able to sell your common stock.. Our common stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. The market for purchases and sales of our common stock is limited and therefore the sale of a relatively small number of shares could cause the price to fall sharply. Accordingly, it may be difficult to sell shares quickly without significantly depressing the value of our common stock. Unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our common stock, sales of our common stock could continue to result in major fluctuations in the price of our common stock.. 12. The price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and subject to fluctuations.. The market price of the securities of software companies has been especially volatile. Additionally, the lack of trading volume for our common stock may cause the market price of our common stock to be subject to fluctuations. If our revenues do not grow or grow more slowly than we anticipate, or, if operating or capital expenditures exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly, or if some other event adversely affects us, the market price of our common stock could decline. If the stock market in general experiences a loss in investor confidence or otherwise fails, the market price of our common stock could fall for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations and financial condition. The market price of our common stock also might decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us.. Our charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that our stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our common stock.. Our certificate of incorporation, as amended, and our bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of MAM. These provisions could also make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tauthorizing our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock; \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimiting the persons who may call special meetings of our stockholders; and \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals.. In addition, the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law govern us. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time without the consent of our board of directors.. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, as amended, our bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions.. If we are not able to comply with the applicable continued listing requirements or standards of the NASDAQ Capital Market, NASDAQ could delist our common stock.. Our common stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other continued listing requirements and standards, including those regarding director independence and independent committee requirements, minimum stockholders’ equity, minimum share price, and certain corporate governance requirements. There can be no assurances that we will be able to comply with the applicable listing standards.. In the event that our common stock is delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market and is not eligible for quotation on another market or exchange, trading of our common stock could be conducted in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities, such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Markets. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for, our common stock, and there would likely also be a reduction in our coverage by securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. Also, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital if we are not listed on a major exchange.. If securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely, our share price and trading volume could decline.. The trading market for our shares of common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our common stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our share price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.. 13. We have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and any return on investment may be limited to potential future appreciation on the value of our common stock.. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to support the development and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including without limitation, our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be a party to at the time. To the extent we do not pay dividends, our shares of common stock may be less valuable because a return on investment will only occur if and to the extent our stock price appreciates, which may never occur. In addition, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize their investment, and if the price of our common stock does not appreciate, then there will be no return on investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock."
