[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. <U+FEFF>. Our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks, including those described below, which in turn may affect the value of our common stock. The risks described below are not the only risks we face.  Other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, or the value of our common stock. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and actual results and events may differ substantially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\". <U+FEFF>. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry. <U+FEFF>. We are subject to the business, financial and operating risks inherent to the vacation ownership industry, any of which could adversely impact our business, prospects and results.. <U+FEFF>. We are subject to a number of business, financial and operating risks inherent to the vacation ownership industry, including, without limitation:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsignificant competition from other vacation ownership businesses and hospitality providers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmarket and/or consumer perception of vacation ownership companies and the industry in general;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreases in operating and other costs (as a result of inflation or otherwise), including marketing costs, employee compensation and benefits, interest expense and insurance, which may not be offset by price or fee increases in our business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in taxes and governmental regulations, including those that influence or set wages, prices, interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe costs and efforts associated with complying with applicable laws and regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trisks related to the development or acquisition of resorts, including delays in, or cancellations of, planned or future resort development or acquisition activities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshortages of labor or labor disruptions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability and cost of capital necessary for us and third-party developers with whom we do business to fund investments, capital expenditures and service debt obligations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to securitize the receivables that we originate in connection with VOI sales;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe financial condition of third-party developers with whom we do business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trelationships with third-party developers, our Vacation Club members and HOAs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the supply and demand for our products and services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprivate resales of VOIs and the sale of VOIs in the secondary market; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunlawful or deceptive third-party VOI resale, cease and desist, or vacation package sales schemes, and reputational risk associated therewith.. <U+FEFF>. Any of these factors could increase our costs, limit or reduce the prices we are able to charge for our products and services or our ability to develop or acquire new resorts or source VOI supply from third parties, or otherwise adversely impact our business, prospects or results.. <U+FEFF>. Our business and operations, including our ability to market VOIs, may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and the availability of financing.. <U+FEFF>. Our business is subject to risks related to general economic and industry conditions and trends. Our results, operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economic and industry conditions, such as high unemployment rates and job insecurity, declines in discretionary spending, declines in real estate values and the occurrence of geopolitical conflicts, including if these or other factors adversely impact the availability of financing for us or our customers or the ability of our customers' to otherwise pay amounts owed under notes receivable. Further, adverse changes affecting the vacation ownership industry, such as an oversupply of vacation ownership units, a reduction in demand for such units, changes in travel and other consumer preferences, demographic and vacation patterns, changes in governmental regulation of the industry, imposition of increased taxes by governmental authorities, the declaration of bankruptcy and/or credit defaults by other vacation ownership companies and negative. 24. publicity for the industry, could also have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our operations and results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to update our business strategy over time and from time to time in response to changing economic and industry conditions.. <U+FEFF>. If we are unable to develop or acquire VOI inventory or enter into and maintain fee-based service agreements or other arrangements to source VOI inventory, our business and results would be adversely impacted.. <U+FEFF>. In addition to developed VOI sales, we source VOIs as part of our capital-light business strategy through fee-based service agreements with third-party developers and through JIT and secondary market arrangements. If we are unable to develop or acquire resorts at the levels or in the time frame anticipated, or are unsuccessful in entering into agreements with third-party developers or others to source VOI inventory in connection with our capital-light business strategy, we may experience a decline in VOI supply, which could result in a decrease in our revenues. In addition, a decline in VOI supply could result in a decrease of financing revenues that are generated by VOI purchases and fee and rental revenues that are generated by our management services.. <U+FEFF>. Our business and properties are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies. Changes in these laws, regulations and policies, as well as the cost of maintaining compliance with new or existing laws, regulations and policies and the imposition of additional taxes on operations, could adversely affect our business. In addition, results of audits of our tax returns or those of our subsidiaries may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. The federal government and the state and local jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted extensive regulations that affect the manner in which we market and sell VOIs and conduct our other business operations. In addition, many states have adopted specific laws and regulations regarding the sale of VOIs. Many states, including Florida and South Carolina, where certain of our resorts are located, extensively regulate the creation and management of timeshare resorts, the marketing and sale of timeshare properties, the escrow of purchaser funds prior to the completion of construction and closing, the content and use of advertising materials and promotional offers, the delivery of an offering memorandum and the creation and operation of exchange programs and multi-site timeshare plan reservation systems. Moreover, with regard to sales conducted in South Carolina, the closing of real estate and mortgage loan transactions must be conducted under the supervision of an attorney licensed in South Carolina and otherwise in accordance with South Carolina's Time Sharing Transaction Procedures Act. Most states also have other laws that are applicable to our activities, such as timeshare project registration laws, real estate licensure laws, mortgage licensure laws, sellers of travel licensure laws, anti-fraud laws, consumer protection laws, telemarketing laws, prize, gift and sweepstakes laws, and consumer credit laws. Our management of, and dealings with, HOAs, including our purchase of defaulted inventory from HOAs in connection with our secondary market sales, are also subject to state laws and resort rules and regulations, including those with respect to the establishment of budgets and expenditures, rule-making, and the imposition of maintenance assessments.. <U+FEFF>. We are authorized to market and sell VOIs in all locations at which our marketing and sales are conducted. If our agents or employees violate applicable regulations or licensing requirements, their acts or omissions could cause the states where the violations occurred to revoke or refuse to renew our licenses, render our sales contracts void or voidable, or impose fines on us based on past activities.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, the federal government and the state and local jurisdictions in which we conduct business have generally enacted extensive regulations relating to direct marketing and telemarketing, including the federal government's national \"do not call\" list, the making of marketing and related calls to cell phone users, a significant development in light of cell phone usage rapidly becoming the primary method of communication, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. These regulations, as well as international data protection laws, have impacted our marketing of VOIs. While we have taken steps designed to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, these steps have increased and are expected to continue to increase our marketing costs and may not prevent failures in compliance. Additionally, adoption of new state or federal laws regulating marketing and solicitation, and changes to existing laws, could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause us to change our marketing strategy. If this occurs, we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies, which could affect the amount and timing of our VOI sales. We cannot predict the impact that these legislative initiatives or any other legislative measures that may be proposed or enacted in the future may have on our marketing strategies and results. Further, from time to time, complaints are filed against us by individuals claiming. 25. that they received calls in violation of applicable regulations. See \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" for a description of litigation that was brought against us and Choice Hotels in January 2018 related to our telemarketing sales activities.. <U+FEFF>. Most states have taxed VOIs as real estate, imposing property taxes that are billed to the respective HOAs that maintain the related resorts, and have not sought to impose sales tax upon the sale of the VOI or accommodations tax upon the use of the VOI. From time to time, however, various states have attempted to promulgate new laws or apply existing laws impacting the taxation of VOIs to require that sales or accommodations taxes be collected. Should new state or local laws be implemented or interpreted to impose sales or accommodations taxes on VOIs, our business could be materially adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. From time to time, consumers file complaints against us in the ordinary course of our business. We could be required to incur significant costs to resolve these complaints or enter into consents with regulators regarding our activities, including that we may be required to refund all or a portion of the purchase price paid by the customer for the VOI. We may not remain in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, and violations of applicable laws may have adverse implications on us, including negative publicity, potential litigation and regulatory sanctions. The expense, negative publicity and potential sanctions associated with any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial position.. <U+FEFF>. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Accessibility Guidelines promulgated thereunder (collectively, the \"ADA\"), all public accommodations, including our properties, must meet various federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with the ADA's requirements could require removal of access barriers or other renovations, and non-compliance could result in the imposition of fines or penalties, or awards of damages, against us. Our properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. Further, various laws govern our resort management activities, including laws and regulations regarding community association management, public lodging, food and beverage services, liquor licensing, labor, employment, health care, health and safety, accessibility, discrimination, immigration, and the environment (including climate change).. <U+FEFF>. Our lending activities are also subject to a number of laws and regulations, including laws and regulations related to consumer loans, retail installment contracts, mortgage lending, fair debt collection and credit reporting practices, consumer collection practices, contacting debtors by telephone, mortgage disclosure, lender licenses and money laundering. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, created under the Dodd-Frank Act, has emphasized new regulatory focus on areas of our business such as consumer mortgage servicing and debt collection, credit reporting and consumer financial disclosures, all of which affect the manner in which we may provide financing to the purchasers of our VOIs and conduct our lending and loan servicing operations.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, VOIs may in the future be deemed to be securities under federal or state law and therefore subject to applicable securities regulation, which could have a material adverse effect on us due to, among other things, the cost of compliance with such regulations.. <U+FEFF>. The vacation ownership and hospitality industries are highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete successfully.. <U+FEFF>. We compete with various high profile and well-established operators, many of which have greater liquidity and financial resources than us. Many of the world's most recognized lodging, hospitality and entertainment companies develop and sell timeshare units or VOIs in resort properties. We also compete with numerous smaller owners and operators of vacation ownership resorts and also face competition from alternative lodging options available to consumers through both traditional methods of delivery as well as new web portals and applications, including private rentals of homes, apartments or condominium units, which have increased in popularity in recent years. Our ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain customers depends on our customers' satisfaction with our products and services as well as on distinguishing the quality, value, and efficiency of our products and services from those offered by our competitors. Customer dissatisfaction with experiences at our resorts or otherwise as a Vacation Club owner, including due to an inability to use points for desired stays, could result in negative publicity and/or a decrease in sales, or otherwise adversely impact our ability to successfully compete in the vacation ownership and hospitality. 26. industries. We may not be able to timely and sufficiently identify and remediate the cause of customer dissatisfaction. Any of these events could materially and adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. Our business and profitability may be impacted if financing is not available on favorable terms, or at all.. <U+FEFF>. In connection with VOI sales, we generally offer financing to the purchaser of up to 90% of the purchase price of the VOI. However, we incur selling, marketing and administrative cash expenses prior to and concurrent with the sale. These costs, along with the cost of the underlying VOI, generally exceed the down payment we receive at the time of the sale. Accordingly, our ability to borrow against or sell our notes receivable has historically been a critical factor in our continued liquidity, and we therefore have depended on funds from our credit facilities and securitization transactions to finance our operations. If our pledged receivables facilities terminate or expire and we are unable to extend them or replace them with comparable facilities, or if we are unable to continue to participate in securitization-type transactions and \"warehouse\" facilities on acceptable terms, our liquidity, cash flow and profitability would be materially and adversely affected. Credit market disruptions have in the past adversely impacted the willingness of banks and other finance companies to provide \"warehouse\" lines of credit for VOI notes receivable and resulted from time to time in the term securitization market being unavailable. Future credit market disruptions may have similar effects or otherwise make obtaining additional and replacement external sources of liquidity more difficult and more costly.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, financing for real estate acquisition and development and the capital markets for corporate debt is cyclical. While we have increased our focus on expanding our fee-based service business and encouraging higher down payments in connection with sales, there is no assurance that these initiatives will enhance our financial position or otherwise be successful in the long-term.. <U+FEFF>. We anticipate that we will continue to seek and use external sources of liquidity, including funds that we obtain pursuant to additional borrowings under our existing credit facilities, under credit facilities that we may obtain in the future, under securitizations in which we may participate in the future or pursuant to other borrowing arrangements, to:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsupport our operations and, subject to declaration by our board of directors and contractual limitations, including limitations contained in our credit facilities, pay dividends;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfinance the acquisition and development of VOI inventory or property and equipment;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfinance a substantial percentage of our sales; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsatisfy our debt and other obligations.. <U+FEFF>. Our ability to service or refinance our indebtedness or to obtain additional financing (including our ability to consummate future term securitizations) depends on the credit markets and on our future performance, which is subject to a number of factors, including the success of our business, our results of operations, leverage, financial condition and business prospects, prevailing interest rates, general economic conditions, the performance of our receivables portfolio, and perceptions about the vacation ownership and real estate industries.. <U+FEFF>. As of December 31, 2017, we had $19.9 million of indebtedness scheduled to become due during 2018. Historically, much of our debt has been renewed or refinanced in the ordinary course of business. However, there is no assurance that we will in the future be able to obtain sufficient external sources of liquidity on attractive terms, or at all, or otherwise renew, extend or refinance all or any portion of our outstanding debt. Any of these occurrences may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, we have and intend to continue to enter into arrangements with third-party developers pursuant to which we sell their VOI inventory for a fee. These arrangements enable us to generate fees from the marketing and sales services we provide, and in certain cases from our provision of management services, without requiring us to fund development and acquisition costs. If these third-party developers are not able to obtain or maintain financing necessary for their development activities or other operations, we may not be able to enter into these fee-based arrangements or have access to their VOI inventory when anticipated, which would adversely impact our results.. <U+FEFF>. 27. We would suffer substantial losses and our liquidity position could be adversely impacted if an increasing number of customers to whom we provide financing default on their obligations.. <U+FEFF>. Adverse conditions in the mortgage industry, including credit availability, borrowers' financial profiles, prepayment rates and other factors, including those outside our control, may increase the default rates we experience or otherwise negatively impact the performance of our notes receivable. In addition, in recent years, external parties have been discouraging certain borrowers from staying current on their note payments. Although in many cases we may have recourse against a buyer for the unpaid purchase price, certain states have laws that limit our ability to recover personal judgments against customers who have defaulted on their loans or we may determine that the cost of doing so may not be justified. Historically, we have generally not pursued such recourse against our customers. In the case of our notes receivable secured by VOIs, if we are unable to collect the defaulted amount due, we traditionally have terminated the customer's interest in the Vacation Club and then remarketed the recovered VOI. Irrespective of our remedy in the event of a default, we cannot recover the marketing, selling and administrative costs associated with the original sale and such costs generally exceed the cash received by us from the buyer at the time of the sale. In addition, we will need to incur such costs again in order to resell the VOI. We update our estimates of such future losses each quarter, and consequently, the charge against sales in a particular period may be impacted, favorably or unfavorably, by a change in expected losses related to notes originated in prior periods. In addition, defaults may cause buyers of, or lenders whose loans are secured by, our VOI notes receivable to reduce the amount of availability or advance rates under receivables purchase and credit facilities, or to result in an increase the interest costs associated with such facilities. In such an event, the cost of financing may increase and we may not be able to secure replacement or alternative financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all, which would adversely affect our earnings, financial position and liquidity.. <U+FEFF>. As described above, our VOI notes receivable financing facilities could be adversely affected if a particular VOI note receivable pool fails to meet certain performance ratios, which could occur if the default rate or other credit metrics of the underlying VOI notes receivable deteriorate. In addition, if we offer financing to purchasers of VOIs with terms longer than those generally offered in the industry, we may not be able to securitize those VOI financing receivables. Our ability to sell securities backed by our VOI notes receivable depends on the continued ability and willingness of capital market participants to invest in such securities. Asset-backed securities issued in our term securitization transactions could be downgraded by credit agencies in the future. If a downgrade occurs, our ability to complete other securitization transactions on acceptable terms or at all could be jeopardized, and we could be forced to rely on other potentially more expensive and less attractive funding sources, to the extent available. Similarly, if other operators of vacation ownership products were to experience significant financial difficulties, or if the vacation ownership industry as a whole were to contract, we could experience difficulty in securing funding on acceptable terms. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely impact our business and results, including, without limitation, by reducing the amount of financing we are able to provide to VOI purchasers, which in turn may result in a reduction in VOI sales.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, under the terms of our pledged and receivable sale facilities, we may be required, under certain circumstances, to replace receivables or to pay down the loan to within permitted loan-to-value ratios. Additionally, the terms of our securitization transactions require us to repurchase or replace loans if we breached any of the representations and warranties we made at the time we sold the receivables. These agreements also often include terms providing that in the event of defaults or delinquencies by customers in excess of stated thresholds, or if other performance thresholds are not met, substantially all of our cash flow from our retained interest in the receivable portfolios sold will be required to be paid to the parties who purchased the receivables from us.. <U+FEFF>. Our existing indebtedness, or indebtedness that we may incur in the future, could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations, and the terms of our indebtedness may limit our activities.. <U+FEFF>. Our level of debt and debt service requirements have several important effects on our operations. Significant debt service cash requirements reduce the funds available for operations and future business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, as well as conditions in the credit markets generally. In addition, our leverage position increases our vulnerability to economic and competitive pressures and may limit funds available for acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, and other general corporate purposes. Further, the financial covenants and other restrictions contained in indentures, credit agreements and other agreements relating to our indebtedness require us to meet certain financial tests and may limit our ability to, among other things, pay dividends, borrow additional funds, dispose of assets or make investments. If we fail to comply with the terms of. 28. our debt instruments, such debt may become due and payable immediately, which would have a material adverse impact on our cash position and financial condition. Significant resources may be required to monitor our compliance with our debt instruments (from a quantitative and qualitative perspective), and such monitoring efforts may not be effective in all cases. We may also incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face, as described above, could intensify.. <U+FEFF>. To the extent inflationary trends, tightened credit markets or other factors affect interest rates, our debt service costs may increase. If interest rates increased one percentage point, the effect on interest expense related to our variable-rate debt would be an annual increase of<U+2009>$2.1 million, based on balances as of December 31, 2017.. <U+FEFF>. The ratings of third-party rating agencies could adversely impact our ability to obtain, renew or extend credit facilities, or otherwise raise funds.. <U+FEFF>. Rating agencies from time to time review prior corporate and specific transaction ratings in light of tightened ratings criteria. In December 2017, Standard & Poor's Rating Services affirmed our 'B+' credit rating. Our corporate credit rating is also based, in part, on rating agencies' speculation about our potential future debt and dividend levels. If rating agencies were to downgrade our corporate credit ratings, our ability to raise funds on favorable terms, or at all, and our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. See \"We would suffer substantial losses and our liquidity position could be adversely impacted if an increasing number of customers to whom we provide financing default on their obligations\" above. In addition, if rating agencies downgraded their original ratings on certain bond classes in our securitizations, holders of such bonds may be required to sell bonds in the marketplace, and such sales could occur at a discount, which could impact the perceived value of the bonds and our ability to sell future bonds on favorable terms or at all. While we are not aware of any reasonably likely downgrades to our corporate credit rating or the ratings of bond classes in our securitizations, such ratings changes can occur without advance notice.. <U+FEFF>. Our future success depends on our ability to market our products and services successfully and efficiently and our marketing expenses have increased and may continue to increase in the future.. <U+FEFF>. As previously described, we compete for customers with hotel and resort properties, other vacation ownership resorts and alternative lodging options, including private rentals of homes, apartments or condominium units. The identification of sales prospects and leads, and the marketing of our products and services to them are essential to our success. We incur expenses associated with marketing programs in advance of the closing of sales. If our lead identification and marketing efforts do not yield enough leads or we are unable to successfully convert sales leads to sales, we may be unable to recover the expense of our marketing programs and systems and our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. In addition, we are focusing and have increased our marketing efforts on selling to new customers, which typically involves a relatively higher marketing cost compared to sales to existing owners and therefore have increased and are expected to continue to increase our sales and marketing expenses. If we are not successful in offsetting the cost increase with greater sales revenue, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely impacted. In addition, our marketing efforts are subject to the risk of changing consumer behavior. Changes in consumer behavior may adversely impact the effectiveness of marketing efforts and strategies which we have in place and we may not be able to timely and effectively respond to such changes.. <U+FEFF>. We generate a significant portion of our new sales prospects and leads through our arrangements with various third parties, including Bass Pro and Choice Hotels. VOI sales to prospects and leads generated by our marketing arrangement with Bass Pro accounted for approximately 15% and 16% of our VOI sales volume during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If our agreement with Bass Pro, or any other significant marketing arrangement, does not generate a sufficient number of prospects and leads or is terminated or limited and not replaced by another source of sales prospects and leads, we may not be able to successfully market and sell our products and services at current sales levels, at anticipated levels or at levels required in order to offset the costs associated with our marketing efforts. On October 9, 2017, Bass Pro raised an issue regarding the computation of the sales commissions paid to it on the sale of VOIs. While we believe that the amount paid was consistent with the terms and intent of the parties' agreements, the resolution of that issue could in the future result in an increase in our marketing costs and adversely impact our operating results and financial condition. We recognized approximately $4.8 million in general administrative expense related to this matter during the fourth quarter of 2017.. <U+FEFF>. 29. We may not be successful in maintaining or expanding our capital-light business relationships, or our capital-light activities, including fee-based sales and marketing arrangements, and JIT and secondary market sales activities, and such activities may not be profitable, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. We offer fee-based marketing, sales, resort management and other services to third-party developers. We have over the last several years continued to expand our capital-light business strategy, which we believe enables us to leverage our expertise in sales and marketing, resort management, mortgage servicing, construction management and title services. We intend to continue our focus on our capital-light business activities as such activities generally produce positive cash flow and typically require less capital investment than our traditional vacation ownership business. We have attempted to structure these activities to cover our costs and generate a profit. Sales of third-party developers' VOIs must generate sufficient cash to comply with the terms of their financing obligations as well as to pay the fees or commissions due to us. The third-party developers may not be able to obtain or maintain financing necessary to meet their requirements, which could impact our ability to sell the developers' inventory. While we could attempt to utilize other arrangements, including JIT arrangements, where we would utilize our receivable credit facilities in order to provide fee-based marketing and sales services, this would reduce the credit otherwise available to us and impact profitability. We commenced our capital-light activities largely during the recession in response to poor economic conditions and our fee-based and other capital-light business activities in the future may be adversely impacted by changes in economic conditions. While we perform fee-based sales and marketing services, we sell VOIs in resorts developed by third parties as an interest in the Vacation Club. This subjects us to a number of risks typically associated with selling products developed by others under our own brand name, including litigation risks. Further, these arrangements may expose us to additional risk as we will not control development activities or timing of development completion. If third parties with whom we enter into agreements are not able to fulfill their obligations to us, the inventory we expect to acquire or market and sell on their behalf may not be available when expected or at all, or may not otherwise be within agreed-upon specifications. Further, if these third parties do not perform as expected and we do not have access to the expected inventory or obtain access to inventory from alternative sources on a timely basis, our ability to maintain or increase sales levels would be adversely impacted.. <U+FEFF>. We also sell VOI inventory through secondary market arrangements which require low levels of capital deployment. In connection with secondary market sales, we acquire VOI inventory from our resorts' HOAs on a non-committed basis in close proximity to the timing of when we intend to sell such VOIs. VOIs purchased from HOAs are typically obtained by the HOAs through foreclosure in connection with maintenance fee defaults and are generally acquired by us at a discount. While we intend to increase our secondary market sales efforts in the future, we may not be successful in doing so, and these efforts may not result in our achieving anticipated results. Further our secondary market sales activities may subject us to negative publicity, which could adversely impact our reputation and business.. <U+FEFF>. Our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted if we do not continue to participate in exchange networks and other strategic alliances with third parties or if our customers are not satisfied with the networks in which we participate or our strategic alliances.. <U+FEFF>. We believe that our participation in exchange networks and other strategic alliances and our Traveler Plus program make ownership of our VOIs more attractive by providing owners with the ability to take advantage of vacation experiences in addition to stays at our resorts. Our participation in the RCI exchange network allows Vacation Club owners to use their points to stay at over 4,300 participating resorts, based upon availability and the payment of a variable exchange fee. During the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 8% of Vacation Club owners utilized the RCI exchange network for a stay of two or more nights. We also have an exclusive strategic arrangement with Choice Hotels pursuant to which, subject to payments and conditions, certain of our resorts have been branded as part of Choice Hotels' Ascend Hotel Collection. For a nominal annual fee and transactional fees, Vacation Club owners may also participate in our Traveler Plus program, which enables them to use their points to access an additional 44 direct exchange resorts, for other vacation experiences such as cruises.  Vacation Club owners can convert their Vacation Club points into Choice Privileges points. Choice Privileges points can be used for stays at Choice Hotels. In addition, Traveler Plus members can directly use their Vacation Club points for stays at Choice Hotels' Ascend Hotel Collection properties, a network of historic and boutique hotels in the United States, Canada, Scandinavia and Latin America. We may not be able to or desire to continue to participate in the RCI or direct exchange networks in the future or maintain or extend our other marketing and strategic networks, alliances and relationships. In addition, these networks, alliances and relationships, and our Traveler Plus program, may not continue to operate effectively,. 30. and our customers may not be satisfied with them. In addition, we may not be successful in identifying or entering into new strategic relationships in the future. If any of these events should occur, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted.. <U+FEFF>. We are subject to certain risks associated with our management of resort properties.. <U+FEFF>. Through our management of resorts and ownership of VOIs, we are subject to certain risks related to the physical condition and operation of the managed resort properties in our network, including:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe presence of construction or repair defects or other structural or building damage at any of these resorts, including resorts we may develop in the future;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany noncompliance with or liabilities under applicable environmental, health or safety regulations or requirements or building permit requirements relating to these resorts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany damage resulting from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods and windstorms, which may increase in frequency or severity due to climate change or other factors; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tclaims by employees, members and their guests for injuries sustained on these resort properties.. <U+FEFF>. Some of these risks may be more significant in connection with the properties for which we recently acquired management agreements, particularly those management agreements which were acquired from operators in financial distress. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs as a result of any of the foregoing, we may be subject to significant costs.. <U+FEFF>. Additionally, a number of U.S. federal, state and local laws, including the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the ADA, impose requirements related to access to and use by disabled persons of a variety of public accommodations and facilities. A determination that our managed resorts are subject to, and that they are not in compliance with, these accessibility laws could result in a judicial order requiring compliance, imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. If one of our managed resorts was required to make significant improvements as a result of non-compliance with these accessibility laws, assessments might be needed to fund such improvements, which additional costs may cause our VOI owners to default on their consumer loans from us or cease making required maintenance fee or assessment payments. Also, to the extent that we hold interests in a particular resort, we would be responsible for our pro rata share of the costs of such improvements. In addition, any new legislation may impose further burdens or restrictions on property owners with respect to access by disabled persons.. <U+FEFF>. The resort properties that we manage are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, natural resources and worker health and safety, including laws and regulations governing and creating liability relating to the management, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and other regulated materials and the cleanup of contaminated sites. The resorts are also subject to various environmental laws and regulations that govern certain aspects of their ongoing operations. These laws and regulations control such things as the nature and volume of wastewater discharges, quality of water supply and waste management practices. To the extent that we hold interests in a particular resort, we would be responsible for our pro rata share of losses sustained by such resort as a result of a violation of any such laws and regulations.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, we may from time to time have disagreements with VOI owners and HOAs resulting from our provision of management services. Failure to resolve such disagreements may result in litigation. Further, disagreements with HOAs could also result in the loss of management contracts, which would negatively affect our revenues and results, and may also have an adverse impact on our ability to generate sales from existing VOI owners.. <U+FEFF>. Our management contracts are typically structured as \"cost-plus,\" with an initial term of three years and automatic one-year renewals. If a management contract is terminated or not renewed on favorable terms or is renegotiated in a manner adverse to us, our revenues and cash flows would be adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. If maintenance fees at our resorts and/or Vacation Club dues are required to be increased, our product could become less attractive and our business could be harmed.. <U+FEFF>. The maintenance fees, special assessments and Vacation Club dues that are levied by HOAs and the Vacation Club on VOI owners may increase as the costs to maintain and refurbish properties, and to keep properties in compliance. 31. with our standards, increase. Increases in such fees, assessments or dues could negatively affect customer satisfaction with our Vacation Club or otherwise adversely impact VOI sales to both new customers and existing VOI owners.. <U+FEFF>. Our strategic transactions may not be successful and may divert our management's attention and consume significant resource.. <U+FEFF>. We intend to continue our strategy of selectively pursuing complementary strategic transactions. We may also purchase management contracts, including from resort operators facing financial distress, and purchase VOI inventory at resorts that we do not manage, with the goal of acquiring sufficient VOI ownership at such a resort to become the manager of that resort. The successful execution of this strategy will depend on our ability to identify and enter into the agreements necessary to take advantage of these potential opportunities, and to obtain any necessary financing. We may not be able to do so successfully. In addition, our management may be required to devote substantial time and resources to pursue these opportunities, which may impact their ability to manage our operations effectively.. <U+FEFF>. Acquisitions involve numerous additional risks, including: (i) difficulty in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business or assets; (ii) potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our day-to-day operations; (iii) difficulty entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have a stronger market position; (iv) difficulty maintaining the quality of services that we have historically provided across new acquisitions; (v) potential legal and financial responsibility for liabilities of the acquired business or assets; (vi) potential overpayment for the acquired business or assets; (vii) increased expenses associated with completing an acquisition and amortizing any acquired intangible assets; (viii) risks associated with any debt incurred in connection with the financing of the transaction; and (ix) challenges in implementing uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies throughout an acquired business.. <U+FEFF>. We are dependent on the managers of our affiliated resorts to ensure that those properties meet our customers' expectations.. <U+FEFF>. In addition to stays at our resorts, Vacation Club owners have access to other resorts and hotels as a result of our participation in exchange programs and our other strategic alliances. Accordingly, Vacation Club owners have access to resorts that we do not manage, own or operate. If the managers of a significant number of those properties were to fail to maintain them in a manner consistent with our standards of quality, we may be subject to customer complaints and our reputation and brand could be damaged. In addition, our agreements with these resorts or their owners may expire, be terminated or not be renewed, or may be renegotiated in a manner adverse to us, and we may be unable to enter into new agreements that provide Vacation Club owners with equivalent access to additional resorts, any or all of which could materially adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. The resale market for VOIs could adversely affect our business.. <U+FEFF>. Based on our experience at our resorts and at resorts owned by third parties, we believe that resales of VOIs in the secondary market generally are made at net sales prices below the original customer purchase prices. The relatively lower sales prices are partly attributable to the high marketing and sales costs associated with the initial sales of such VOIs. Accordingly, the initial purchase price of a VOI may be less attractive to prospective buyers and we compete with buyers who seek to resell their VOIs. While VOI resale clearing houses or brokers currently do not have a material impact on our business, the availability of resale VOIs at lower prices, particularly if an organized and liquid secondary market develops, could adversely affect our level of sales and sales prices, which in turn would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. We are subject to the risks of the real estate market and the risks associated with real estate development, including a decline in real estate values and a deterioration of other conditions relating to the real estate market and real estate development.. <U+FEFF>. Real estate markets are cyclical in nature and highly sensitive to changes in national and regional economic conditions, including:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlevels of unemployment;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlevels of discretionary disposable income;. 32.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlevels of consumer confidence;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of financing;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toverbuilding or decreases in demand;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinterest rates; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfederal, state and local taxation methods.. <U+FEFF>. A deterioration in general economic conditions or in the real estate market would have a material adverse effect on our business.. <U+FEFF>. We expect to seek to acquire more real estate inventory in the future. The availability of land for development of resort properties at favorable prices will be critical to our profitability and the ability to cover our significant selling, general and administrative expenses, cost of capital and other expenses. If we are unable to acquire such land or resort properties at a favorable cost, our results of operations may be materially, adversely impacted. The profitability of our real estate development activities is also impacted by the cost of construction, including the costs of materials and labor and other services. Should the cost of construction materials and services rise, the ultimate cost of our future resorts inventory when developed could increase and have a material, adverse impact on our results of operations. We are also exposed to other risks associated with development activities, including, without limitation:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse conditions in the capital markets may limit our ability to raise capital for completion of projects or for development of future properties;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconstruction delays, zoning and other local, state or federal governmental approvals, cost overruns, lender financial defaults, or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, volcanic eruptions and oil spills, increasing overall construction costs, affecting timing of project completion or resulting in project cancellations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany liability or alleged liability or resulting delays associated with latent defects in design or construction of projects we have developed or that we construct in the future adversely affecting our business, financial condition and reputation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure by third-party contractors to perform for any reason, exposing us to operational, reputational and financial harm; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe existence of any title defects in properties we acquire.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, the third-party developers from whom we source VOI inventory as part of our capital-light business strategy are exposed to such development-related risks and, therefore, the occurrence of such risks may adversely impact our ability to acquire VOI inventory from them when expected or at all.. <U+FEFF>. Environmental liabilities, including claims with respect to mold or hazardous or toxic substances, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.. <U+FEFF>. Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, as well as common law, we may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances, including mold, located on, in or emanating from property that we own, lease or operate, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage at such property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease our property or to borrow money using such property or receivables generated from the sale of such property as collateral. Noncompliance with environmental, health or safety requirements may require us to cease or alter operations at one or more of our properties. Further, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from violations of environmental regulations or from contamination associated with one or more of our properties.. <U+FEFF>. Our insurance policies may not cover all potential losses.. <U+FEFF>. We maintain insurance coverage for liability, property and other risks with respect to our operations and activities. While we have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary, market forces beyond our control may limit the scope of the insurance coverage we can obtain or our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates. The cost of insurance may increase and our coverage levels. 33. may decrease, which may affect our ability to maintain customary insurance coverage and deductibles at acceptable costs. There is a limit as well as various sub-limits on the amount of insurance proceeds we will receive in excess of applicable deductibles. If an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of our properties, the claims from each affected property may be considered together per policy provisions to determine whether the per occurrence limit, annual aggregate limit or sub-limits, depending on the type of claim, have been reached. If the limits or sub-limits are exceeded, each affected property may only receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy. Further, certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, terrorist acts, and certain environmental matters, may be outside the general coverage limits of our policies, subject to large deductibles, deemed uninsurable or too cost-prohibitive to justify insuring against. In addition, in the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of the affected resort or in some cases may not provide a recovery for any part of a loss. As a result, we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future marketing, sales or revenue opportunities from the property. Further, we could remain obligated under guarantees or other financial obligations related to the property despite the loss of product inventory, and our VOI owners could be required to contribute toward deductibles to help cover losses.. <U+FEFF>. Adverse outcomes in legal or other regulatory proceedings, including claims of non-compliance with applicable regulations or development-related defects, could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.. <U+FEFF>. In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which result in significant expenses and devotion of time. In addition, litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse outcomes in the litigation and other proceedings to which we are or may be subject could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. In addition, liabilities related to our former Bluegreen Communities business that were not assumed by Southstar Development Partners, Inc. (\"Southstar\") in connection with Southstar's purchase of substantially all of the assets which comprised Bluegreen Communities during 2012, including those relating to Bluegreen Communities' operations prior to the closing of the transaction, remain our responsibility.. <U+FEFF>. We engage third-party contractors to construct our resorts. We also historically engaged third-party contractors to develop the communities within the Bluegreen Communities business. However, customers may assert claims against us for construction defects or other perceived development defects, including, without limitation, structural integrity, the presence of mold as a result of leaks or other defects, water intrusion, asbestos, electrical issues, plumbing issues, road construction, water and sewer defects and defects in the engineering of amenities. In addition, certain state and local laws may impose liability on property developers with respect to development defects discovered in the future. We could have to accrue a significant portion of the cost to repair such defects in the quarter when such defects arise or when the repair costs are reasonably estimable.. <U+FEFF>. Costs associated with litigation, including claims for development-related defects, and the outcomes thereof could adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and operating results.. <U+FEFF>. Failure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions or operational inefficiencies, damage our reputation and/or subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits.. <U+FEFF>. We collect and retain large volumes of internal and customer data, including social security numbers, credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers in various internal information systems and information systems of our service providers. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. The integrity and protection of that customer, employee and company data is critical to us. We could make faulty decisions if that data is inaccurate or incomplete. Our customers and employees also have a high expectation that we and our service providers will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment as well as the requirements imposed on us by the payment card industry surrounding information, security and privacy is also increasingly demanding, in both the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our systems may be unable to satisfy changing regulatory and payment card industry requirements and employee and customer expectations, or may require significant additional investments or time in order to do so.. Our information systems and records, including those we maintain with our service providers, may be subject to security breaches, cyber attacks, system failures, viruses, operator error or inadvertent releases of data. A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, employee or company data maintained by us or by a service provider could. 34. adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses, fines or litigation. A breach in the security of our information systems or those of our service providers could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems, resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits.. The proliferation and global reach of social media continues to expand rapidly and could cause us to suffer reputational harm. The continuing evolution of social media presents new challenges and requires us to keep pace with new developments, technology and trends. Negative posts or comments about us, the properties we manage or our brands on any social networking or user-generated review website, including travel and vacation property websites, could affect consumer opinions of us and our products, and we cannot guarantee that we will timely or adequately redress such instances. Inadequate or failed technologies could lead to interruptions in our operations, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.. In addition, conversions to new information technology systems require effective change management processes and may result in cost overruns, delays or business interruptions. If our information technology systems are disrupted, become obsolete or do not adequately support our strategic, operational or compliance needs, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. Our technology requires updating, the cost involved in updating the technology may be significant, and the failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position.. <U+FEFF>. The vacation ownership and hospitality industries require the utilization of technology and systems, including technology utilized for sales and marketing, mortgage servicing, property management, brand assurance and compliance, and reservation systems. This technology requires continuous updating and refinements, including technology required to remain competitive and to comply with the legal requirements such as privacy regulations and requirements established by third parties. We are taking steps to update our information technology platform, which has required, and is likely to continue to require, significant capital expenditures. Older systems which have not yet been updated may increase the risk of operational inefficiencies, financial loss and non-compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and we may not be successful in updating such systems in the time frame or at the cost anticipated. Further, as a result of the rapidly changing technological environment, systems which we have put in place or expect to put in place in the near term may become outdated requiring new technology, and we may not be able to replace those systems as quickly as our competition or within budgeted costs and time frames. Further, we may not achieve the benefits that may have been anticipated from any new technology or system.. <U+FEFF>. Our intellectual property rights, and the intellectual property rights of our business partners, are valuable, and the failure to protect those rights could adversely affect our business.. <U+FEFF>. Our intellectual property rights, including existing and future trademarks, trade secrets and copyrights, are and will continue to be valuable and important assets of our business. We believe that our proprietary technology, as well as our other technologies and business practices, are competitive advantages and that any duplication by competitors would harm our business. The measures we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. Additionally, intellectual property laws and contractual restrictions may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. Finally, even if we are able to successfully protect our intellectual property, others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology. We also generate a significant portion of our new sales prospects and leads through arrangements with third parties, including Bass Pro. The failure by these third parties to protect their intellectual property rights could also harm our business.. <U+FEFF>. The loss of the services of our key management and personnel could adversely affect our business.. <U+FEFF>. Our ability to successfully implement our business strategy will depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced and knowledgeable management and other professional staff, and we may not be successful in doing so. If our efforts to retain and attract key management and other personnel are unsuccessful, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted.. <U+FEFF>. 35. There are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions used could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. Consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP involve making estimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and assumptions include, but are not limited to, those related to future cash flows, which in turn are based upon expectations of future performance given current and projected forecasts of the economy in general and the real estate markets. If any estimates, judgments or assumptions change in the future, including in the event that our performance does not otherwise meet our expectations, we may be required to record impairment charges against our earnings, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, GAAP requirements as to how certain estimates are made may result, for example, in asset valuations which ultimately would not be realized if we were to attempt to sell the asset.. <U+FEFF>. 36. The provisional tax impacts resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are based on interpretations and assumptions the Company has made. Any changes in interpretations and assumptions or the issuance of additional regulatory guidance may have a material adverse impact on our tax rate in fiscal years 2018 and beyond.. <U+FEFF>. On December 22, 2017, U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Reform Act\"), was signed into law, significantly changing the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. These changes include, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate, subjecting certain future foreign subsidiary earnings, whether or not distributed, to U.S. tax under a Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income provision, imposing a new alternative \"Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax\" on U.S. corporations that limits deductions for certain amounts payable to foreign affiliates, imposing significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest payable to related and unrelated lenders, further limiting deductible executive compensation, and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries through the end of 2017. We continue to analyze how the Tax Reform Act may impact our results of operations.  The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") to address the application of GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. The Company has recognized the provisional tax impacts related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Reform Act. This continued analysis and resulting uncertainty, along with many of the changes effected pursuant to the Tax Reform Act, may have an adverse or volatile effect on our tax rate in fiscal years 2018 and beyond, thereby affecting our results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock. <U+FEFF>. BBX Capital's controlling position in our common stock limits our shareholders' ability to influence corporate matters, including the outcome of director elections and other matters requiring shareholder approval.. <U+FEFF>. BBX Capital holds 90% of our outstanding common stock. As a result of such ownership position, BBX Capital is able to exercise control over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, amendments of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions impossible without the support of BBX Capital. Alan B. Levan, our Chairman and the Chairman of BBX Capital, and John E. Abdo, our and BBX Capital's Vice Chairman, may be deemed to control BBX Capital by virtue of their collective ownership of the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock of BBX Capital. The interests of BBX Capital and Mr. Alan Levan and Mr. Abdo may conflict with our interests or the interests of our other shareholders, including that they may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance BBX Capital's investment, in us or improve BBX Capital's financial condition, even though such transactions might involve risks to us. In addition, this concentration of ownership could deprive shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock as part of a sale of our Company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock.. <U+FEFF>. Our stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.. <U+FEFF>. The market price for our common stock may be volatile, and such volatility may be exacerbated by our relatively small public float. In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those discussed in this \"Risk Factors\" section and under \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\" as well as the following:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock or changes in financial estimates by analysts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability to meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow our common stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstrategic actions by us or our competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or other transactions;. 37.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tintroduction of new products or services by us or our competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvariations in our quarterly operating results and those of our competitors, including due to seasonal fluctuations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadditions or departures of key personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic and stock market conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trisks related to our business and industry, including those discussed above;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in conditions or trends in our industry, markets or customers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory and legal proceedings, investigations and developments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical developments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in accounting principles;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in tax legislation and regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tterrorist acts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe expiration of contractual lock-up or market standoff agreements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfuture sales of our common stock or other securities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdefaults under agreements governing our indebtedness; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinvestor perceptions with respect to our common stock relative to other investment alternatives.. <U+FEFF>. The stock markets in general have often experienced volatility that has sometimes been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class-action litigation has often been brought against that company. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type may be expensive to defend and may divert our management's attention and resources from the operation of our business.. <U+FEFF>. If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and our reputation.. <U+FEFF>. As a Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") reporting company, we are required to, among other things, maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting. We will also be required to provide annual management reports on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2018. In addition, once we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K (but not earlier than our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2018) will be required to include independent registered public accounting firm attestations of our internal control over financial reporting. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. We have dedicated a significant amount of time and resources to implement our internal financial and accounting controls and procedures. Substantial work and expenses may continue to be required to implement, document, assess, test and, as necessary, remediate our system of internal controls.. <U+FEFF>. If our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, if we are not able to issue our financial statements in a timely manner or if we are not able to obtain the required audit or review of our financial statements by our independent registered public accounting firm in a timely manner, we will not be able to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC and the listing requirements of the NYSE. If these events occur, the listing of our common stock on the NYSE could be suspended or terminated and our stock price could materially suffer. In addition, we or members of our management could be subject to investigation and sanction by the SEC and other regulatory authorities and to shareholder lawsuits, which could impose significant additional costs on us and divert management attention.. <U+FEFF>. We will incur increased costs as a result of becoming a public company.. <U+FEFF>. As a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"), the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the NYSE and other applicable securities laws and regulations. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for. 38. reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as our executive officers.. <U+FEFF>. Our shareholders' interests may be diluted by future stock issuances.. <U+FEFF>. Pursuant to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and our Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws, our board of directors will have the authority, without any action or vote of our shareholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock. We may issue such capital stock to meet a number of our business needs, including funding any potential acquisitions or other strategic transactions, or pursuant to any equity compensation plans that we may adopt in the future. Stock issuances would reduce the percentage ownership of our then-current shareholders and, in the case of issuances of preferred stock, may result in the interest of our shareholders being subject to the prior rights of holders of that preferred stock.. <U+FEFF>. We may not pay dividends on our common stock in the amounts anticipated, when anticipated, or at all.. <U+FEFF>. During January 2018, our board of directors declared a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.15 per share. We currently intend to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock in an amount equal to $0.15 per share. However, any dividends, including the timing and amount thereof, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be subject to applicable law and contractual restrictions, including restrictions contained in our credit facilities, and our financial condition, results of operations, available cash, capital requirements, general business conditions and prospects, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Accordingly, we may not make dividend payments on our common stock in the amount or when anticipated, or at all.. <U+FEFF>. Provisions in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and our Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws, as well as provisions of Florida law, might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control or changes in our management and/or depress the trading price of our common stock.. <U+FEFF>. Our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and our Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws contain, and Florida law contains, provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that shareholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include those which:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgrant our board of directors the authority to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock and to fix the relative rights and preferences of the preferred stock (in each case, without any action or vote of our shareholders), which could be used for, among other things, the adoption of a shareholder rights plan if determined to be advisable by our board of directors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpermit our board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly-created directorships; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tspecify advance notice procedures that must be complied with by shareholders in order to make shareholder proposals or nominate directors.. <U+FEFF>. As a Florida corporation, we are also subject to the provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act (the \"FBCA\"), including those limiting the voting rights of<U+2009> \"control shares.\" Under the FBCA, subject to certain exceptions, including mergers and acquisitions effected in accordance with the FBCA, the holder of<U+2009> \"control shares\" of a Florida corporation that has (i) 100 or more shareholders, (ii) its principal place of business, its principal office or substantial assets in Florida and (iii) either more than 10% of its shareholders residing in Florida, more than 10% of its shares owned by Florida residents or 1,000 shareholders residing in Florida, will not have the right to vote those shares unless the acquisition of the shares was approved by a majority of each class of voting securities of the corporation, excluding those shares held by interested persons. \"Control shares\" are defined in the FBCA as shares acquired by a person,. 39. either directly or indirectly, that when added to all other shares of the issuing corporation owned by that person, would entitle that person to exercise, either directly or indirectly, voting power within any of the following ranges: (i) 20% or more but less than 33% of all voting power of the corporation's voting securities; (ii) 33% or more but less than a majority of all voting power of the corporation's voting securities; or (iii) a majority or more of all of the voting power of the corporation's voting securities.. <U+FEFF>. Any provision of our governance documents or Florida law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.. <U+FEFF>. Our Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws has an exclusive forum provision, which could limit our shareholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, and a fee-shifting provision, which may discourage the initiation of claims against us or our directors, officers or other employees.. <U+FEFF>. Our Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws has an exclusive forum provision providing that, unless our board of directors consents to the selection of an alternative forum, the Circuit Court located in Palm Beach County, Florida (or, if such Circuit Court does not have jurisdiction, another Circuit Court located within Florida or, if no Circuit Court located within Florida has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the Southern District of Florida) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our Company; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our shareholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the FBCA, our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or our Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws (in each case, as amended or amended and restated from time to time); or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Florida (each, a \"Covered Proceeding\"). Further, the exclusive forum provision provides that if any Covered Proceeding is filed in a court other than a court located within Florida in the name of any shareholder, then such shareholder shall be deemed to have consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within Florida in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the exclusive forum provision and (ii) having service of process made upon such shareholder in any such enforcement action by service upon such shareholder's counsel in the action as agent for such shareholder. Unless waived, the exclusive forum provision may limit our shareholders' ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the exclusive forum provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Our Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws also provide us and our officers, directors and other employees with the right, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law (and unless our board of directors consents to the contrary), to reimbursement of all amounts incurred by us and our officers, directors and other employees, including, without limitation, all attorneys' fees and other litigation expenses, from any person or entity that initiates or asserts any claim or counterclaim against us or any of our officers, directors or other employees, or joins, offers substantial assistance to or has a direct financial interest in any such claim or counterclaim, if such person or entity does not obtain a judgment on the merits that substantially achieves, in substance and amount, the full remedy sought. This fee-shifting provision is intended to eliminate or decrease nuisance and frivolous litigation. We intend to apply the fee-shifting provision broadly to all claims and counterclaims, including those relating to derivative actions and other Covered Proceedings, claims under the federal securities laws and claims related to this offering (collectively, \"Claims\"). In addition, the fee-shifting provision applies to any person or entity which initiates, asserts, joins in, offers substantial assistance to, or has a direct financial interest in, any Claim, including current and prior shareholders (each, a \"Claiming Party\"). The court issuing a judgment on the merits of a Claim may determine whether the Claiming Party obtained a judgment on the merits that substantially achieves, in substance and amount, the full remedy sought. We intend to interpret this language as broadly as possible and believe it is a very high standard. Specifically, we believe that this standard would require, and we would argue to a court to interpret this standard to require, the Claiming Party to prevail on virtually everything sought in the Claim in order to avoid its reimbursement obligations. As a result, the fee-shifting provision may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees, including those that might otherwise benefit us or our shareholders, or increase the costs thereof to any Claiming Party.. 40. <U+FEFF>. Future sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.. <U+FEFF>. The market price of our common stock could decline significantly as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.. <U+FEFF>. Including shares sold by BBX Capital pursuant to the underwriters exercise of its option to purchase additional shares during December 2017, a total of approximately 7.5 million shares of our common stock were sold in the initial public offering of our common stock during November 2017. Other than a limited number of shares that were sold to our directors and executive officers, the shares sold in our initial public offering are freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. In addition, in connection with our initial public offering, we, our directors and executive officers and BBX Capital agreed with the underwriters, subject to certain exceptions, not to sell any shares of our common stock for 180 days after the date of the prospectus related to the initial public offering without the prior consent of the representatives of the underwriters. Such 180-day period will expire in May 2018. The representatives of the underwriters may, in their sole discretion, release all or any portion of the shares of our common stock from such lock-up restrictions. Upon the expiration or waiver of such lock-up agreements, the shares covered thereby will be eligible for resale, subject to volume, manner of sale and other limitations set forth in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. If our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if the public perceives that such sales could occur, including as any restrictions on resale end, there could be an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business.. <U+FEFF>. In the future, we may also issue shares of our common stock in connection with investments or acquisitions or pursuant to any equity compensation plans that we may adopt. The number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition or pursuant to equity compensation plans could be material. Any issuance of additional shares of our common stock would result in dilution to our shareholders.. <U+FEFF>. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.. <U+FEFF>. The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our Company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the price or trading volume of our common stock to decline. Moreover, if one or more of our analysts who cover our Company downgrades our common stock, including if our operating results do not meet their or the investor community's expectations, our stock price could decline.. <U+FEFF>. We are an \"emerging growth company\" and are permitted to rely on exemptions from disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and this may make our common stock less attractive to investors.. <U+FEFF>. We are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act, and may remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2022, we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue, we have more than $700.0 million in market value of our stock held by non-affiliates (and we have been a public company for at least 12 months and have filed one Annual Report on Form 10-K) or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt securities over a three-year period. We have relied, and for so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted, and intend, to rely, on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include reduced financial disclosure, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, exemptions from the requirements to hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our reliance on some or all. 41. of these exemptions. If investors find our common stock less attractive, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.. <U+FEFF>. We are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the listing standards of the NYSE and, as a result, we qualify for, and may rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements applicable to non-controlled companies.. <U+FEFF>. As a result of BBX Capital's controlling position with respect to our common stock, we are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the listing standards of the NYSE. As a \"controlled company,\" we may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements set forth in the listing standards of the NYSE, including:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe requirement that a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors under the NYSE listing standards;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe requirement that nominating and corporate governance matters be decided solely by a nominating/corporate governance committee consisting of independent directors under the NYSE listing standards; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe requirement that employee and officer compensation matters be decided by a compensation committee consisting of independent directors under the NYSE listing standards.. <U+FEFF>. While we currently do not rely on or intend to utilize any of these exceptions, we may, in our board of directors' discretion, choose to utilize one or more of the exceptions in the future. In that case, our shareholders will not have the same protections as a shareholder of a company that is subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.. 42"
