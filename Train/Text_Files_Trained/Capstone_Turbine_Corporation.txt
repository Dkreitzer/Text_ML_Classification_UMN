These statements are based largely on our current expectations, estimates and forecasts and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward - looking statements. Factors that can cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, those discussed below. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward - looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The following factors should be considered in addition to the other information contained herein in evaluating us and our business. We assume no obligation to update any of the forward - looking statements after the filing of this Form 10-K to conform such statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations, except as may be required by law.. The following are risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward - looking statements contained in this Form 10-K because these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward - looking statements. Before you invest in our publicly traded securities, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks, including the risks described below. Additional risks of which we may not be aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations or our stock price. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be negatively. 18. Table of Contents. affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10 - Q and other documents filed by us from time to time.. Our operating history is characterized by net losses. We anticipate further losses and we may never become profitable.. Since inception, we have incurred annual operating losses. We expect this trend to continue until such time that we can sell a sufficient number of units and achieve a cost structure to become profitable. Our business is such that we have relatively few repeat end use customers and limited repeat business compared to our competitors. As a result, we may not maintain or increase revenue. We may not have adequate cash resources to reach the point of profitability, and we may never become profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to increase our sales and sustain or increase our profitability in the future.. We may be unable to fund our future operating requirements, which could force us to curtail our operations.. To the extent that the funds we now have on hand are insufficient to fund our future operating requirements, we would need to raise additional funds, through further public or private equity or debt financings depending upon prevailing market conditions. These financings may not be available or, if available, may be on terms that are not favorable to us and could result in dilution to our stockholders and reduction of the trading price of our stock. The state of capital markets when we seek to raise additional capital could also impede our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If adequate capital were not available to us, we likely would be required to significantly curtail our operations or possibly even cease our operations.. On June 2, 2017, we entered into two secured credit facilities (the \"Bridge Bank Credit Agreements\") with Western Alliance Bank through its Bridge Bank division (\"Bridge Bank\"), with credit support provided by the Export-Import Bank of the United States through its working capital guarantee program.  Under the terms of the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements, we may borrow up to $12.0 million on a revolving basis depending on, among other factors, the amount of our eligible inventory and accounts receivable. The Bridge Bank Credit Agreements are for a two-year period ending June 2, 2019.. Total borrowings, letter of credit obligations and the then aggregate committed amount of cash management services under the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements may not exceed 85% of the sum of unrestricted cash and the amount of cash collateral held at Bridge Bank. As a condition of the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements, we have restricted $5.0 million of cash equivalents as additional security for the credit facility. Borrowings under the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements will bear per annum interest at the prime rate plus 1.5 percent, subject to increase during the occurrence of an event of default. Obligations under the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements are secured by all of our assets, including intellectual property and general intangibles.. On June 1, 2018, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the \"Letter Agreement\") with Bridge Bank. The Letter Agreement extended the maturity date under the Company's Bridge Bank Credit Agreements from June 2, 2019 to June 2, 2021. The Letter Agreement increased the line of credit to an amount up to $15.0 million from $12.0 million. Additionally, the Letter Agreement reduced the per annum interest from prime rate plus 1.50 percent to 1.0 percent; the facility fee from 0.625% to 0.5%; and the cash collateral held at Bridge Bank from 42% to 40%, which is $6.0 million of the $15.0 million facility, as well as no fee for early termination.. The Bridge Bank Credit Agreements include affirmative covenants as well as negative covenants that prohibit a variety of actions without Bridge Bank's consent, including covenants that limit our ability to (a) incur or guarantee debt, (b) create liens, (c) enter into any merger, recapitalization or similar transaction or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or stock of another entity, or (d) sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of our assets.. The financial covenants of the domestic credit agreement with Bridge Bank (the \"Domestic Facility\") requires us not to exceed specified levels of losses relative to our financial model and the outstanding line of credit advances may not exceed 85% of the sum of unrestricted cash and the amount of cash collateral held at Bridge Bank. The Domestic Facility also defines an event of default to include a material adverse effect on our business. An event of default for this. 19. Table of Contents. or any other reason, if not waived, could have a material adverse effect on us. Our obligations under the credit facility could have important consequences, including the following:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe may have difficulty obtaining additional financing at favorable interest rates to meet our requirements for operations, capital expenditures, general corporate or other purposes.. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of funds available for operations, capital expenditures and future acquisitions.. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe may be required to repay our indebtedness immediately if we default on any of the numerous financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements. It is not certain whether we will have, or will be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. If any outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness.. If we are unable to either substantially improve our operating results or obtain additional financing, we may be unable to continue to operate at current levels.. We have experienced recurring operating losses and as of March 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $862.2 million. On March 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $19.4 million, and working capital of $21.7 million. This compares to $852.2 million, $19.7 million and $17.1 million, respectively, on March 31, 2017. As a condition of the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements, we have restricted $5.0 million of cash equivalents as additional security for the credit facility and not available to us.. Our business strategy is focused on profitability-oriented initiatives such as reducing operating expenses, diversifying and increasing revenue, improving gross margin and utilizing our joint venture, Capstone Energy Finance to provide financing options for the purchase of Capstone microturbines. We may not be able to execute the business strategy successfully and if we are unable to generate positive cash flow, potential customers may choose not to purchase our products or utilize our program. Moreover, the business strategy is based upon projections, which are in turn based upon estimates and assumptions. There can be no assurance as to the accuracy of the projections, estimates and assumptions which underlie the business strategy or as to our ability to execute the business strategy successfully.. Should we be unable to execute our plans to increase sales and margins while controlling costs, we may be unable to continue to operate at our current levels on a longer-term basis. In particular, we must generate positive cash flow from operations and net income and otherwise improve our results of operations substantially on a longer-term basis. Our available cash and proceeds from future financings, if any, that we may be able to obtain, may not be sufficient to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. Any such lack of funds would affect our ability to continue to operate at current levels. These events and circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional capital and on the market value of our common stock and our ability to maintain our credit facility. Moreover, should we experience a cash shortage that requires us to curtail or cease our operations, or should we be unable to continue to operate at current levels, you could lose all or part of your investments in our securities.. Impairment charges on our long - lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.. We evaluate the carrying value of long - lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. To determine whether impairment has occurred, we compare the undiscounted cash flows of the long - lived asset group with its carrying value. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant estimates of factors that include future sales growth, gross margin performance, including our estimates of reductions in our direct material costs, and reductions in operating expenses. If our sales growth, gross margin performance or other estimated operating results are not achieved at or above our forecasted level, or inflation exceeds our forecast, the carrying value of our asset group may prove to be. 20. Table of Contents. unrecoverable and we may incur impairment charges in the future. In addition, significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate, unanticipated competition, loss of key customers or changes in technology or markets, could require a charge for impairment that can materially and adversely affect our reported net loss and our stockholders' equity.. A sustainable market for microturbines may never develop or may take longer to develop than we anticipate which would adversely affect our results of operations.. Our products represent an emerging market, and we do not know whether our targeted customers will accept our technology or will purchase our products in sufficient quantities to allow our business to grow. To succeed, demand for our products must increase significantly in existing markets, and there must be strong demand for products that we introduce in the future. In addition, as part of our business strategy, we are focusing our marketing efforts on the energy efficiency, renewable energy, natural resources, critical power, microgrid and transportation markets. We may be unable to grow our business in these target markets. If a sustainable market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate, we may be unable to recover the losses we have incurred to develop our products, we may have further impairment of assets, and we may be unable to meet our operational expenses. The development of a sustainable market for our systems may be hindered by many factors, including some that are out of our control. Examples include:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconsumer reluctance to try a new product;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory requirements;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost competitiveness of our microturbines;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcosts associated with the installation and commissioning of our microturbines;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmaintenance and repair costs associated with our microturbines;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe future costs and availability of fuels used by our microturbines;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teconomic downturns and reduction in capital spending;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconsumer perceptions of our microturbines' safety and quality;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe emergence of newer, more competitive technologies and products;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgrowth of the HEV market; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdecrease in domestic and international incentives.. We depend upon the development of new products and enhancements of existing products.. Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products, enhance existing products and reduce the costs to produce our products. The success of our products is dependent on several factors, including proper product definition, product cost, timely completion and introduction of the products, differentiation of products from those of our competitors, meeting changing customer requirements, emerging industry standards and market acceptance of these products. The development of new, technologically advanced products and enhancements is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation, as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new or enhanced products to market in a timely manner, successfully lower costs and achieve market acceptance of our products, or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or uncompetitive.. 21. Table of Contents. Our operating results are dependent, in large part, upon the successful commercialization of our products. Failure to produce our products as scheduled and budgeted would materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.. We cannot be certain that we will deliver ordered products in a timely manner. We have limited production slots for our products. Any delays in production will increase our costs, reduce future production slots and could significantly impact our business, financial condition and operating results.. We may not be able to produce our products on a timely basis if we fail to correctly anticipate product supply requirements or if we suffer delays in production resulting from issues with our suppliers. Our suppliers may not supply us with a sufficient amount of components or components of adequate quality, or they may provide components at significantly increased prices.. Some of our components are currently available only from a single source or limited sources. We may experience delays in production if we fail to identify alternative suppliers, or if any parts supply is interrupted, each of which could materially adversely affect our business and operations. In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with certain suppliers that allow them to procure inventories based upon criteria defined by us. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete inventories, which could adversely affect our business. Additionally, if we fail to correctly anticipate our internal supply requirements, an undersupply of parts could limit our production capacity. Our inability to meet volume commitments with suppliers could affect the availability or pricing of our parts and components. A reduction or interruption in supply, a significant increase in price of one or more components or a decrease in demand of products could materially adversely affect our business and operations and could materially damage our customer relationships. Financial problems of suppliers on whom we rely could limit our supply of components or increase our costs. Also, we cannot guarantee that any of the parts or components that we purchase will be of adequate quality or that the prices we pay for the parts or components will not increase. Inadequate quality of products from suppliers could interrupt our ability to supply quality products to our customers in a timely manner. Additionally, defects in materials or products supplied by our suppliers that are not identified before our products are placed in service by our customers could result in higher warranty costs and damage to our reputation. We also outsource certain of our components internationally. As a result of outsourcing internationally, we may be subject to delays in delivery because of regulations associated with the import/export process, delays in transportation or regional instability.. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, we received notification from one of our single source suppliers that they were at maximum capacity and would require prepayment and a significant increase in the price of multiple components in order to fulfill our supply requirements for Fiscal 2019. Due to their capacity issues, it is uncertain if we will experience an interruption in parts from this supplier or be able to fully offset or recover any resulting component price increases. This could impact margins or sales in future quarters.. Commodity market factors impact our costs and availability of materials.. Our products contain a number of commodity materials from metals, which include steel, special high temperature alloys, copper, nickel and molybdenum, to computer components. The availability of these commodities could impact our ability to acquire the materials necessary to meet our production requirements. The cost of metals has historically fluctuated. The pricing could impact the costs to manufacture our products. If we are not able to acquire commodity materials at prices and on terms satisfactory to us or at all, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.. Adverse economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition, including some effects we may not be able to predict.. Adverse economic conditions may prevent our customers from purchasing our products or delay their purchases, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted or made very expensive at a time when we need, or would. 22. Table of Contents. like, to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial resources. Certain industries in which our customers do business and certain geographic areas have been and could continue to be adversely affected by adverse economic conditions. Although we experience revenue growth in fiscal 2018, our revenue continues to be negatively impacted by the volatility of the global oil and gas markets, a strong U.S. dollar (making our products more expensive overseas) and ongoing global geopolitical tensions.. Product quality expectations may not be met, causing slower market acceptance or warranty cost exposure.. In order to achieve our goal of improving the quality and lowering the total costs of ownership of our products, we may require engineering changes. Such improvement initiatives may render existing inventories obsolete or excessive. Despite our continuous quality improvement initiatives, we may not meet customer expectations. Any significant quality issues with our products could have a material adverse effect on our rate of product adoption, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Moreover, as we develop new configurations for our microturbines and as our customers place existing configurations in commercial use, our products may perform below expectations. Any significant performance below expectations could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flow and affect the marketability of our products.. We sell our products with warranties. There can be no assurance that the provision for estimated product warranty will be sufficient to cover our warranty expenses in the future. We cannot ensure that our efforts to reduce our risk through warranty disclaimers will effectively limit our liability. Any significant incurrence of warranty expense in excess of estimates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flow. Further, we have at times undertaken programs to enhance the performance of units previously sold. For example, during Fiscal 2017, we recorded a one-time non-cash warranty provision of approximately $5.2 million to proactively retrofit select non-Signature Series C200 microturbines with the more robust new Signature Series generator components to improve product performance and reliability.. These enhancements have at times been provided at no cost or below our cost. If we choose to offer such programs again in the future, such actions could result in significant costs.. We operate in a highly competitive market among competitors who have significantly greater resources than we have and we may not be able to compete effectively.. We compete with several technologies, including reciprocating engines, fuel cells and solar power. Competing technologies may receive certain benefits, like governmental subsidies or promotion, or be able to offer consumer rebates or other incentives that we cannot receive or offer to the same extent. This could enhance our competitors' abilities to fund research, penetrate markets or increase sales. We also compete with other manufacturers of microturbines.. Our competitors include several well - known companies with histories of providing power solutions. They have substantially greater resources than we do and have established worldwide presence. Because of greater resources, some of our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can or lobby for governmental regulations and policies to create competitive advantages vis - à - vis our products. We believe that developing and maintaining a competitive advantage will require continued investment by us in product development and quality, as well as attention to product performance, our product prices, our conformance to industry standards, manufacturing capability and sales and marketing. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish collaborative relationships among themselves or with third parties, including third parties with whom we have business relationships. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.. Overall, the market for our products is highly competitive and is changing rapidly. We believe that the primary competitive factors affecting the market for our products, including some that are outside of our control, include:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tname recognition, historical performance and market power of our competitors;. 23. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct quality and performance;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toperating efficiency;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct price;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tavailability, price and compatibility of fuel;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelopment of new products and features; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\temissions levels.. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against either current or potential competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flow.. Our products involve a lengthy sales cycle, and we may not anticipate sales levels appropriately, which could impair our results of operations.. The sale of our products typically involves a significant commitment of capital by customers, which can result in the typical delays associated with large capital expenditures. For these and other reasons, the sales cycle associated with our products is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control. We plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. If sales in any period fall significantly below anticipated levels, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow would suffer. If demand in any period increases well above anticipated levels, we may have difficulties in responding, incur greater costs to respond, or be unable to fulfill the demand in sufficient time to retain the order, which would negatively impact our operations. In addition, our operating expenses are based on anticipated sales levels, and a high percentage of our expenses are generally fixed in the short term. As a result of these factors, a small fluctuation in timing of sales can cause operating results to vary materially from period to period.. Net product orders for Fiscal 2018 were $42.3 million and contributed to an ending backlog of $97.3 million at March 31, 2018. The book-to-bill ratio was 1.0:1 for Fiscal 2018. Book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of new orders we received to units shipped and billed during a period. However, because our backlog represents only the estimated amount of future product revenue to be recognized under negotiated contracts as shipments convert backlog to recognized revenue for accounting purposes, we may not be able to fully realize the revenue value reported in our backlog, and our backlog may not be indicative of future revenues. A portion of our backlog is concentrated in the international oil and gas market which may impact the overall timing of shipments or the conversion of backlog to revenue. The timing of the backlog is based on the requirement date indicated by our customers. Based on historical experience, management expects that a significant portion of our backlog may not be shipped within the next 18 months. The timing of shipments is subject to change based on several variables (including customer deposits, payments, availability of credit and customer delivery schedule changes), most of which are not in our control and can affect the timing of our revenue. As a result, management believes the book-to-bill ratio demonstrates the current demand for our products in the given period.. On October 13, 2017, we entered into an Accounts Receivable Assignment Agreement (the \"Assignment Agreement\") and Promissory Note (the \"Note\") with Turbine International, LLC (\"TI\").. Pursuant to the terms of the Assignment Agreement, we agreed to assign to TI the right, title and interest to receivables owed to us from BPC Engineering, our former Russian distributor (\"BPC\"), upon TI's payment to us of $2.5 million in three payments by February 1, 2018. We received payments from TI of approximately $0.3 million and $1.0 million under the Assignment Agreement during the three and twelve months ended March 31, 2018, respectively which was recorded as bad debt recovery. The receivables owed to us from BPC had a balance of $5.3 million as of March 31, 2018, and this balance was fully reserved. As of March 31, 2018, the right, title and interest to the accounts receivables owed to us from BPC had not been assigned to TI, as TI had not yet made all payments as required under the. 24. Table of Contents. Assignment Agreement by February 1, 2018.. In connection with the terms of the Note, we granted TI the sole distribution rights for our products and services in the Russian oil and gas sector. As a result of this appointment, TI agreed to pay us $3.8 million over a three-year period in 35 equal monthly installments starting in August 2018.. On October 13, 2017, we and Hispania Petroleum, S.A. (the \"Guarantor\"), entered into a Guaranty Agreement (the \"Guaranty Agreement\") whereby the Guarantor guarantees TI's obligations under the Agreement and Note. However, due to our limited business relationship with TI and the missed payments on the Assignment Agreement, we deferred recognition of the Assignment Agreement and Note until collectability is reasonably assured.. On June 5, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the Assignment Agreement (the \"Amended Assignment Agreement\") and the Note (the \"Amended Note\") with TI. Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Assignment Agreement, the right, title and interest to receivables owed to us from BPC will be contingent upon TI's payment to us of the remaining approximately $1.5 million in five payments by September 20, 2019. Under the terms of the Amended Note, TI agreed to pay us $3.8 million over a three-year period in 13 equal quarterly installments starting in December 20, 2019.. Due to the above amendments, we removed from product backlog orders related to BPC for approximately $7.2 million. This removal was the result of product pricing that we no longer would honor. After removal of the foregoing orders, the remaining backlog related to BPC as of March 31, 2018 comprises up to approximately 42% of our total backlog. This remaining backlog related to BPC continues to be reviewed with TI and the other new distributors in the region, and they have the right to request delivery of those backlog orders if the associated projects proceed. Nonetheless the remaining backlog related to BPC may be negatively impacted.. If we do not effectively implement our sales, marketing and service plans, our sales will not grow and our results of operations will suffer.. Our sales and marketing efforts may not achieve intended results and, therefore, may not generate the revenue we anticipate. As a result of our corporate strategies, we have decided to focus our resources on selected vertical markets. We may change our focus to other markets or applications in the future. There can be no assurance that our focus or our near term plans will be successful. If we are not able to address markets for our products successfully, we may not be able to grow our business, compete effectively or achieve profitability.. Our business and financial performance depends in part on the oil and natural gas industry, and a decline in prices for oil and natural gas may have an adverse effect on our revenue, cash flows, profitability and growth.. The significant decline in oil and natural gas prices beginning in late 2014 caused a reduction in our customers' spending and associated drilling and completion activities, which had an adverse effect on our revenue for multiple years. Although we have experienced an improvement in revenue during Fiscal 2018 due to a rebound in oil prices, we continue to be impacted by the volatility of the global oil and gas. If prices were to decline again, we would expect to see similar declines in our customers' spending which would have an adverse effect on our revenue. In addition, a worsening of these conditions may result in a material adverse impact on certain of our customers' liquidity and financial position resulting in further spending reductions, delays in the collection of amounts owing to us and similar impacts.. Our sales and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted by risks inherent in international markets.. As we expand in international markets, customers may have difficulty or be unable to integrate our products into their existing systems or may have difficulty complying with foreign regulatory and commercial requirements. As a result, our products may require redesign. Any redesign of the product may delay sales or cause quality issues. In addition, we may be subject to a variety of other risks associated with international business, including import/export restrictions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic or political instability.. 25. Table of Contents. The current geopolitical instability in Russia and Ukraine and related sanctions by the U.S. government against certain companies and individuals may hinder our ability to conduct business with potential or existing customers and vendors in these countries.. We derived approximately 3% and 11% of our revenue from Russia during Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. The continuation or escalation of the current geopolitical instability in Russia and Ukraine could negatively impact our operations, sales, and future growth prospects in that region. The U.S. government imposed sanctions through several executive orders restricting U.S. companies from conducting certain oil and gas production related business activities with specified Russian and Ukrainian individuals and companies and requiring export licenses for certain of such activities. While we believe that the executive orders currently do not preclude us from conducting business with our current customers in Russia, the sanctions imposed by the U.S. government could be expanded in the future to restrict us from engaging with them. If we are unable to conduct business with new or existing customers or pursue opportunities in Russia or Ukraine or elsewhere, our business, including revenue, profitability and cash flows, could be materially adversely affected. If we are unable to conduct business with certain vendors, our operations in Russia and Ukraine could be materially adversely affected.. Changes to trade regulation, quotas, duties or tariffs, caused by the changing U.S. and geopolitical environments or otherwise, may increase our costs or limit the amount of raw materials and products that we can import, or may otherwise adversely impact our business.. The current U.S. administration has voiced strong concerns about imports from countries that it perceives as engaging in unfair trade practices, and may decide to impose import duties or other restrictions on products, components or raw materials sourced from those countries, which may include China and other countries from which we import components or raw materials. Any such duties or restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.. Moreover, these new tariffs, or other changes in U.S. trade policy, could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries. Certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods. Others are considering the imposition of sanctions that will deny U.S. companies access to critical raw materials. A \"trade war\" of this nature or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, to adversely impact our businesses.. Our business may be impacted by international instability, war, terrorism, and geopolitical events.. International political and economic instability or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption, expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect the performance of our services, sale of our products or other business operations. A slowdown in economic growth in some emerging markets could result in long sales cycles, greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles. Fluctuations or devaluations in currency values, especially in emerging markets, could have an adverse effect on us, our suppliers, logistics providers and manufacturing vendors. All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.. We may not be able to retain or develop relationships with OEMs or distributors in our targeted markets, in which case our sales would not increase as expected.. In order to serve certain of our targeted markets, we believe that we must ally ourselves with companies that have particular expertise or better access to those markets. We believe that retaining or developing relationships with strong OEMs (which to date have typically resold our products under their own brands or packaged our products with other products as part of an integrated unit) or distributors in these targeted markets can improve the rate of adoption as well as reduce the direct financial burden of introducing a new technology and creating a new market. Because of OEMs' and distributors' relationships in their respective markets, the loss of an OEM or distributor could adversely impact the ability to penetrate our target markets. We offer our OEMs and distributors stated discounts from list price for. 26. Table of Contents. the products they purchase. In the future, to attract and retain OEMs and distributors we may provide volume price discounts or otherwise incur significant costs that may reduce the potential revenue from these relationships. We may not be able to retain or develop appropriate OEMs and distributors on a timely basis, and we cannot provide assurance that the OEMs and distributors will focus adequate resources on selling our products or will be successful in selling them. In addition, some of the relationships may require that we grant exclusive distribution rights in defined territories. These exclusive distribution arrangements could result in our being unable to enter into other arrangements at a time when the OEM or distributor with whom we form a relationship is not successful in selling our products or has reduced its commitment to market our products. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to negotiate collaborative relationships on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to have appropriate distribution in our target markets may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.. We have substantial accounts receivable, and increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.. Our accounts receivable balance, net of allowances, was $16.0 million and $17.0 million as of March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively. Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable (\"DSO\") at the end of Fiscal 2018 was 69 days, compared with 68 days at the end of Fiscal 2017. We recorded net bad debt recovery of approximately $1.1 million and $1.5 million during Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. No assurances can be given that future bad debt expense will not increase above current operating levels. Increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on cash flows and results of operations.. We may experience a delay in payment or may not collect on the Accounts Receivable Assignment Agreement or Promissory Note with Turbine International, LLC.. On October 13, 2017, we entered into an Accounts Receivable Assignment Agreement (the \"Assignment Agreement\") and Promissory Note (the \"Note\") with TI.. Pursuant to the terms of the Assignment Agreement, we agreed to assign to TI the right, title and interest to receivables owed to us from BPC upon TI's payment to us of $2.5 million in three payments by February 1, 2018. We received payments from TI of approximately $0.3 million and $1.0 million under the Assignment Agreement during the three and twelve months ended March 31, 2018, respectively which was recorded as bad debt recovery. The receivables owed to us from BPC had a balance of $5.3 million as of March 31, 2018, and this balance was fully reserved. As of March 31, 2018, the right, title and interest to the accounts receivables owed to us from BPC had not been assigned to TI, as TI had not yet made all payments as required under the Assignment Agreement by February 1, 2018.. In connection with the terms of the Note, we granted TI the sole distribution rights for our products and services in the Russian oil and gas sector. As a result of this appointment, TI agreed to pay us $3.8 million over a three-year period in 35 equal monthly installments starting in August 2018.. On October 13, 2017, we and Hispania Petroleum, S.A. (the \"Guarantor\"), entered into a Guaranty Agreement (the \"Guaranty Agreement\") whereby the Guarantor guarantees TI's obligations under the Agreement and Note. However, due to our limited business relationship with TI and the missed payments on the Assignment Agreement, we deferred recognition of the Assignment Agreement and Note until collectability is reasonably assured.. On June 5, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the Assignment Agreement (the \"Amended Assignment Agreement\") and the Note (the \"Amended Note\") with TI. Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Assignment Agreement, the right, title and interest to receivables owed to us from BPC will be contingent upon TI's payment to us of the remaining approximately $1.5 million in five payments by September 20, 2019. Under the terms of the Amended Note, TI agreed to pay us $3.8 million over a three-year period in 13 equal quarterly installments starting in December 20, 2019.. 27. Table of Contents. Loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.. E-Finity accounted for approximately 16% of our revenue for Fiscal 2018. Additionally, Serba, E-Finity and Supernova, accounted for 20%, 18% and 10%, respectively, of net accounts receivable as of March 31, 2018. The loss of E-Finity or any other significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.. We may not be able to develop sufficiently trained applications engineering, installation and service support to serve our targeted markets.. Our ability to identify and develop business relationships with companies who can provide quality, cost - effective application engineering, installation and service can significantly affect our success. The application engineering and proper installation of our microturbines, as well as proper maintenance and service, are critical to the performance of the units. Additionally, we need to reduce the total installed cost of our microturbines to enhance market opportunities. Our inability to improve the quality of applications, installation and service while reducing associated costs could affect the marketability of our products.. Changes in our product components may require us to replace parts held at distributors.. We have entered into agreements with some of our distributors requiring that if we render parts obsolete in inventories they own and hold in support of their obligations to serve fielded microturbines, we are required to replace the affected stock at no cost to the distributors. It is possible that future changes in our product technology could involve costs that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial position.. We operate in a highly regulated business environment, and changes in regulation could impose significant costs on us or make our products less economical, thereby affecting demand for our microturbines.. Our products are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, governing, among other things, emissions and occupational health and safety. Regulatory agencies may impose special requirements for the implementation and operation of our products or that may significantly affect or even eliminate some of our target markets. We may incur material costs or liabilities in complying with government regulations. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws, regulations and requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future. Furthermore, our potential utility customers must comply with numerous laws and regulations. The deregulation of the utility industry may also create challenges for our marketing efforts. For example, as part of electric utility deregulation, federal, state and local governmental authorities may impose transitional charges or exit fees, which would make it less economical for some potential customers to switch to our products. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to obtain these approvals and changes in a timely manner, or at all. Non - compliance with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.. The market for electricity and generation products is heavily influenced by federal and state government regulations and policies. The deregulation and restructuring of the electric industry in the United States and elsewhere may cause rule changes that may reduce or eliminate some of the advantages of such deregulation and restructuring. We cannot determine how any deregulation or restructuring of the electric utility industry may ultimately affect the market for our microturbines. Changes in regulatory standards or policies could reduce the level of investment in the research and development of alternative power sources, including microturbines. Any reduction or termination of such programs could increase the cost to our potential customers, making our systems less desirable, and thereby adversely affect our revenue and other operating results.. Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers to our entry into the marketplace, and we may not be able to effectively sell our products.. Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers on the installation of our products or the interconnection of the products with the electric grid. Further, they may charge additional fees to customers who install. 28. Table of Contents. on - site generation or have the capacity to use power from the grid for back - up or standby purposes. These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our products or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems. This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and other operating results. In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our operations. The cost of electric power generation bears a close relationship to natural gas and other fuels. However, changes to electric utility tariffs often require lengthy regulatory approval and include a mix of fuel types as well as customer categories. Potential customers may perceive the resulting swings in natural gas and electric pricing as an increased risk of investing in on - site generation.. We may not achieve production cost reductions necessary to competitively price our products, which would adversely affect our sales.. We believe that we will need to reduce the unit production cost of our products over time to maintain our ability to offer competitively priced products. Our ability to achieve cost reductions will depend on our ability to develop low cost design enhancements, to obtain necessary tooling and favorable supplier contracts and to increase sales volumes so we can achieve economies of scale. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to achieve any such production cost reductions. Our failure to achieve such cost reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. Potential intellectual property, labor, product liability, stockholder or other litigation may adversely impact our business.. From time to time, we may face litigation relating to intellectual property, labor, product liability, stockholder and other matters. An adverse judgment could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations, the trading price of our common stock and our ability to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all. Whether or not resolved in a manner adverse to us, any litigation could be costly, divert management attention or result in increased costs of doing business. Further, our insurance coverage is limited for these and other claims against us, and we may not have adequate insurance or financial resources to pay for our liabilities or losses from any such claims.. Our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights.. We view our intellectual property rights as important assets. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements. These protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, breaching any confidentiality agreements with us, copying or reverse engineering our products, or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own. The unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business. If it became necessary for us to litigate to protect these rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail. We cannot guarantee that any patents, issued or pending, will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties. Moreover, the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products. In addition, we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties' intellectual property rights. Any such claim, even if it is without merit, may be expensive and time - consuming to defend, subject us to damages, cause us to cease making, using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property, require us to redesign our products, divert management time and attention and/or require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements.. We face security and cybersecurity risks related to our electronic processing of sensitive and confidential business and product data. If we are unable to protect our data or the data of our customers, a security breach could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.. As a manufacturer of high technology commercial products, we face security and cyber security threats, as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with information technology failures or cyber security attacks. Given the nature of our business, we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer and associate data, in. 29. Table of Contents. addition to proprietary business information. Our business, including our turbines and related energy assets may be vulnerable to a data compromise, computer viruses, physical and electronic break-ins and manipulations and similar disruptions, which may not be prevented by our efforts to secure our computer systems and assets, which include vulnerability scans and patching, network firewalls, identity and access management, data encryption, intrusion detection and prevention devices. Regular penetration tests of our networks are conducted by a third party service provider and we leverage any findings to further enhance our security. We also employ secure file transfer options to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential information. Our critical data is backed up to a separate secured data storage facility. However, our efforts may not be able to prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks and a successful breach of our computer systems could result in misappropriation of personal, payment or sensitive business information. In addition, we rely on associates, contractors and other third parties who may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. A security breach involving confidential and proprietary data or the fleet of turbines we have deployed across the globe for our customers could damage our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers or gain new customers. The competitive advantages derived from our R&D efforts, the usefulness of our products and services, our reputation and our stock price could be impacted.  In addition, we may incur material liabilities and remediation costs as a result of a security breach and, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover the impact to the business. Although we have developed mitigating security controls to reduce our cyber risk and protect our data and our products, our customers' data and our customers' turbines from a security breach, such measures cannot provide absolute security and accordingly any security breach may have a material adverse effect on our business.  Moreover, changing privacy laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, including the adoption by the European Union of the General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which became effective May 2018, creates new individual privacy rights and imposes increased obligations on companies handling personal data. Consequently, we may incur significant costs related to prevention and compliance with laws regarding the protection and unauthorized disclosure of personal information. A failure to comply with the stringent rules of the GDPR could result in fines of up to \20020 million.. We may incur costs and liabilities as a result of product liability claims.. We face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage. Although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. A significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed. If our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products, which could reduce our sales and profitability.. We have significant tax assets, usage of which may be subject to limitations in the future.. At March 31, 2018, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $657.8 million and $146.6 million, respectively, which may be utilized to reduce future taxable income, subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. These deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. Any subsequent accumulations of common stock ownership leading to a change of control under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including through sales of stock by large stockholders, all of which are outside of our control, could limit and defer our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future federal income tax liabilities.. The effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on our business have not yet been fully analyzed and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.. On December 22, 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act. The Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to reducing the Federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, requiring a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creating new taxes on certain foreign sourced. 30. Table of Contents. earnings. The one-time transition tax is based on the total post-1986 earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiary that was previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. We continue to analyze the impact the Tax Act may have on our business including the impact of the total post-1986 foreign earnings and profits for our foreign subsidiary. Notwithstanding the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the Tax Act is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, guidance is still forthcoming, and no assurance can be made that future guidance will not adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.. Activities necessary to integrate any future acquisitions may result in costs in excess of current expectations or be less successful than anticipated.. We may acquire other businesses in the future and the success of these transactions will depend on, among other things, our ability to develop productive relationships with the corresponding distributors and to integrate assets and personnel, if any, acquired in these transactions and to apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses. The integration of any acquired businesses or significant assets may require significant attention from our management, and the diversion of management's attention and resources could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipated when we first enter into these transactions. If actual integration costs are higher than amounts assumed, if we are unable to integrate the assets and personnel acquired in an acquisition as anticipated, or if we are unable to fully benefit from anticipated synergies, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.. Operational restructuring may result in asset impairment or other unanticipated charges.. As a result of our corporate strategy, we have identified opportunities to outsource to third - party suppliers certain functions which we currently perform. We believe outsourcing can reduce product costs, improve product quality and increase operating efficiency. These actions may not yield the expected results, and outsourcing may result in production delays or lower quality products. Transitioning to outsourcing may cause certain of our affected employees to leave before the outsourcing is complete. This could result in a lack of the experienced in - house talent necessary to successfully implement the outsourcing. Further, depending on the nature of operations outsourced and the structure of agreements we reach with suppliers to perform these functions, we may experience impairment in the value of manufacturing assets related to the outsourced functions or other unanticipated charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.. We have effected reductions in our operating costs and, as a result, our ability to cut costs further and sustain our business initiatives may be limited.. Beginning in late 2008, we have implemented various initiatives to reduce operating costs across all functions of the Company and focus our business efforts on our most promising near-term product opportunities. As a result of these cost-cutting initiatives, we may have a more limited ability to further reduce costs to increase our liquidity should such measures become necessary. Any further reductions may have a materially negative impact on our business.. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, expand our production capabilities or improve our operational, financial and management information systems, which would impair our results of operations.. If we are successful in executing our business plan, we will experience growth in our business that could place a significant strain on our business operations, management and other resources. Our ability to manage our growth will require us to expand our production capabilities, continue to improve our operational, financial and management information systems, and to motivate and effectively manage our employees. We cannot provide assurance that our systems, procedures and controls or financial resources will be adequate, or that our management will keep pace with this growth. We cannot provide assurance that our management will be able to manage this growth effectively.. 31. Table of Contents. Our success depends in significant part upon the continuing service of management and key employees.. Our success depends in significant part upon the continuing service of our executive officers, senior management and sales and technical personnel. The failure of our personnel to execute our strategy or our failure to retain management and personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our success will be dependent on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees. There can be no assurance that we can do so.. Our internal control systems rely on employees trained in the execution of the controls. Loss of these employees or our inability to replace them with similarly skilled and trained individuals or new processes in a timely manner could adversely impact our internal control mechanisms.. Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake and other events beyond our control.. Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake and other events beyond our control. Our executive offices and manufacturing facilities are located in southern California. Because the southern California area is located in an earthquake - sensitive area, we are particularly susceptible to the risk of damage to, or total destruction of, our facilities in southern California and the surrounding transportation infrastructure, which could affect our ability to make and transport our products. If an earthquake, fire or other natural disaster occurs at or near our facilities, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.. We cannot be certain of the future effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls over our financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in our ability to provide reliable and timely financial reports and the value of our common stock may decline.. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in our annual reports on Form 10-K our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal controls over financial reporting. Our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of March 31, 2018. We may in the future identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting that we have not discovered to date. If we cannot adequately maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our securities.. We are subject to a number of pending lawsuits.. We and certain of our current and former officers are named as defendants in a shareholder class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, and in a separate but similar lawsuit brought by two individual shareholders in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Additionally, we and certain of our current and former officers and directors are named as defendants in various state and federal derivative suits. We may be named as defendants in future lawsuits. These current and future matters may result in significant liabilities and diversion of our management's time, attention and resources. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these matters. In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves and, to the extent available, liability insurance. Protracted litigation, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, any significant judgment or settlement amount may require us to incur additional indebtedness, adversely affect our liquidity and ability to service our indebtedness, or require us to restructure or amend the terms of our indebtedness. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K for more information regarding currently pending legal proceedings.. 32. Table of Contents. If we fail to meet all applicable Nasdaq Capital Market requirements and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock, impair the value of your investment and adversely affect our ability to raise needed funds.. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements. On December 12, 2016, we received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market (\"Nasdaq\") stating that, for 30 consecutive business days preceding the notice date, the closing bid price for our common stock had been below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).  On June 13, 2017 we were afforded an additional 180-day grace period to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. On October 26, 2017 we regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. On December 18, 2017, we received a notice from the Nasdaq stating that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price for our common stock had been below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company was afforded 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. On April 2, 2018 we regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards in the future.. If we fail to meet all applicable Nasdaq Capital Market requirements in the future and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations. This delisting could also impair the value of your investment.. The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment in our securities.. An investment in our securities is risky, and stockholders could lose their investment in our securities or suffer significant losses and wide fluctuations in the market value of their investment. The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be highly volatile. Given the continued uncertainty surrounding many variables that may affect our business and the industry in which we operate, our ability to foresee results for future periods is limited. This variability could affect our operating results and thereby adversely affect our stock price. Many factors that contribute to this volatility are beyond our control and may cause the market price of our common stock to change, regardless of our operating performance. Factors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price may include, among other things:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmarket sentiment toward alternative energy stocks in general or toward us;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconditions or trends in our industry or the overall economy;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of one or more of our significant customers;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\terrors, omissions or failures by third parties in meeting commitments to us;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the market valuations or earnings of our competitors or other technology companies;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe trading of options on our common stock;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives;. 33.

In addition, the stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Capital Market and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies affected. The market prices of securities of technology companies and companies servicing the technology industries have been particularly volatile. These broad market and industry factors may cause a material decline in the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class - action litigation has often been instituted against that company. This type of litigation, regardless of whether we prevail on the underlying claim, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which could materially harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.. Our business could be negatively affected as a result of a proxy contest.. A proxy contest and any related litigation would require us to incur significant legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses and administrative and associated costs and require significant time and attention by management, our board of directors and employees, and would divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategy, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to execute on our strategy, or changes to the composition of our board of directors or senior management team arising from a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business, instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors and may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives or attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of the proxy contest or matters arising from the proxy contest, which would serve as a further distraction to our board of directors, management and employees and would require us to incur significant additional costs. In addition, the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the uncertainties described above or the outcome of a proxy contest or any related litigation.. 34.

If such a change in the composition of our board of directors were to occur, it could trigger the change of control provisions of certain agreements and arrangements to which we are a party, including the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements, our Amended and Restated Change of Control Severance Plan and the Amended and Restated Change in Control Severance Agreement, as amended, between us and Darren Jamison, our President and Chief Executive Officer.. Under the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements, a change of control constitutes an event of default that would entitle Bridge Bank to, among other remedies, declare all of our outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Bank Credit Agreements immediately due and payable. Under the Amended and Restated Change of Control Severance Plan and the Amended and Restated Change in Control Severance Agreement, as amended, following a change of control, upon the occurrence of a qualifying termination of Mr. Jamison or certain of our other executive officers and employees, we will be obligated to make specified severance payments to the terminated employee.. If such a change in our board composition were to occur, and if our board of directors were unable to take certain mitigating action to avoid triggering, or if we were unable to obtain a waiver of, these and other similar change of control provisions to which we are subject, the resulting payments and other obligations required of us could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to conduct our business or could otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and our NOL rights plan, as well as Delaware law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.. Provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and our stockholder rights plan, as well as provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, could discourage, delay or prevent unsolicited proposals to merge with or acquire us, even though such proposals may be at a premium price or otherwise beneficial to you. These provisions include our board's authorization to issue shares of preferred stock, on terms the board determines in its discretion, without stockholder approval, and the following provisions of Delaware law that restrict many business combinations.. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which could prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a 15% or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such stockholder acquired such status unless appropriate board or stockholder approvals are obtained.. On May 6, 2016, we and Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. successor-in-interest to Computershare Inc., as Rights Agent, entered into a Rights Agreement (the \"NOL Rights Agreement\") designed to diminish the risk that our ability to use our net operating losses and certain other tax assets to reduce potential future federal income tax obligations would become subject to limitations by reason of us experiencing an \"ownership change,\" as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. While this NOL Rights Agreement is intended to preserve our net operating losses, it effectively deters current and future purchasers from becoming 4.99% stockholders. The NOL Rights Agreement could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders.. The market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by market conditions affecting the stock markets in general, including price and trading fluctuations on Nasdaq.. Market conditions may result in volatility in the level of, and fluctuations in, market prices of stocks generally and, in turn, our common stock and sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the market, in each case being unrelated or disproportionate to changes in our operating performance. Concerns over global stability and economic conditions in the United States and abroad have contributed to the extreme volatility of the markets which may have an effect on the market price of our common stock.. 35. Table of Contents. Future issuances of our common stock could lower our stock price and dilute the interests of existing stockholders.. We may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future. The issuance of a substantial amount of common stock could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current stockholders. In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of common stock in the public market, either in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by investors who acquired such common stock in a private placement, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.. The trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.. We do not intend to pay cash dividends. We have never paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our securities will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases.. We have not paid dividends on any of our capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Consequently, in the foreseeable future, you will likely only experience a gain from your investment in our securities if the price of our common stock increases."
