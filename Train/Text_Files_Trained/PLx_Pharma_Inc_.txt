[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. We have described below a number of risk factors which, in addition to uncertainties, risks and other information presented elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The uncertainties and risks enumerated below, as well as those presented elsewhere in this Form 10-K, should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company, our business and the value of our securities. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Please also read carefully the section entitled “Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” included in this Form 10-K.. 21. Table of Contents. Risks Related to Our Business and Capital Requirements. We have not yet generated significant revenues, have a limited operating history, have incurred net losses in each year since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and if we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market value of our common stock will likely decline.. We have not generated any revenue from the sale of products, have generated minimal revenue from licensing and grant activities, and have incurred losses in each year since we commenced operations. The Company’s net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $15.3 million. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $67.3 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and commercialization of Aspertec and our other product candidates. Our expenses will also increase substantially if and when we:. <U+25CF> \t\t\tdiscover and develop additional product candidates; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\testablish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize Aspertec and any other product candidates for which we may obtain marketing  approval; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\testablish a manufacturing and supply chain sufficient for commercial quantities of Aspertec and any other product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tmaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\thire additional clinical, scientific, regulatory and commercial personnel; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tadd operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future; and  \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies.. Even if we do generate revenues, we may never achieve profitability. If we do achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders’ equity and working capital. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market value of our common stock will likely decline. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when, if ever, we will become profitable.. We will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or terminate our operations or commercialization efforts.. As of December 31, 2017, we had working capital of approximately $23.9 million and cash and cash equivalents of approximately $24.4 million. We anticipate that we will need to raise substantial additional financing in the future to fund our operations.. We may obtain additional financing through public or private equity offerings, debt financings (including related-party financings), a credit facility or strategic collaborations. On August 9, 2017, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) that provides for a Term Loan Facility (the “Term Loan Facility” and all amounts borrowed thereunder, the “Term Loan”). Under the Term Loan Facility, the Company borrowed an initial amount of $7.5 million, and will have the right to borrow an additional $7.5 million on or before December 31, 2018, provided that the Company first obtains (a) net new capital of not less than $20,000,000 and (ii) FDA approval for the 81 mg formulation of Aspertec, the Company’s lead product.. 22. Table of Contents. Additional financing may not be available to us when we need it or it may not be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies. Our future financing requirements will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\tthe timing of, and costs involved in, seeking and obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe scope, progress, expansion, and costs of manufacturing our product candidates; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe resources we devote to marketing, and, if approved, commercializing our product candidates; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tour revenue, if any, from successful commercialization of our product candidates; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe costs associated with being a public company. \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other discovery and research and development activities; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights, including litigation costs and the  results of such litigation; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tour ability to enter into additional collaboration, licensing or other arrangements, including collaborative agreements to support the development of our product candidates, and the terms and timing of such arrangements; and \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe type, number, costs and results of the product candidate development programs which we are pursuing or may choose to pursue in the future.. Future capital requirements will also depend on the extent to which we acquire or invest in additional complementary businesses, products and technologies. We currently have no understandings, commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to sell or license to others technologies or clinical product candidates or programs that we would prefer to develop and commercialize ourselves. Without additional funding — or, alternatively, a partner willing to collaborate and fund development — we will be unable to continue development of PL1200 Ibuprofen or any other development-stage products in our pipeline.. We are substantially dependent on the success of our lead product candidate, Aspertec. If we are unable to successfully commercialize Aspertec or experience significant delays in doing so, our business could be materially harmed.. Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to successfully commercialize Aspertec, which will depend on several factors, including the following:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablishing commercial manufacturing and supply arrangements; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\testablishing a commercial infrastructure; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tidentifying and successfully establishing one or more collaborations to commercialize Aspertec; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tacceptance of the product by the medical community, patients and third-party payors; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tobtaining market share while competing with more established companies; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\ta continued acceptable safety and adverse event profile of the product; and \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tqualifying for, identifying, registering, maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims covering the product.. 23. Table of Contents. Serious adverse events, undesirable side effects or other unexpected properties of Aspertec or any other product candidate may be identified after approval that could delay, prevent or cause the withdrawal of regulatory approval, limit the commercial potential, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval.. Serious adverse events or undesirable side effects caused by, or other unexpected properties of, Aspertec or our other product candidates could cause us, an IRB, or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt our manufacturing and distribution operations and could result in a more restrictive label, the imposition of distribution or use restrictions or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. If Aspertec or any of our other product candidates are associated with serious adverse events or undesirable side effects or have properties that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many compounds that initially showed promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause undesirable or unexpected side effects that prevented further development of the compound.. Undesirable side effects or other unexpected adverse events or properties of Aspertec or any of our other product candidates could arise or become known either during clinical development or, if approved, after the approved product has been marketed. If such an event occurs during development, our trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of, or deny approval of, our other product candidates. If such an event occurs with respect to Aspertec, a number of potentially significant negative consequences may result, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory authorities may withdraw the approval of such product; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label or impose distribution or use restrictions; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tregulatory authorities may require one or more post-market studies; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\twe may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\twe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tour reputation may suffer.. Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate, or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which could delay or prevent us from generating revenue from the sale of our products and harm our business and results of operations.. Even though Aspertec 325 mg has already obtained regulatory approval, it may never achieve market acceptance by physicians, patients, and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success and the market opportunity may be smaller than we estimate.. Even if we are able to launch Aspertec commercially, it may not achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, hospitals (including pharmacy directors) and third-party payors and, ultimately, may not be commercially successful. Market acceptance of Aspertec and any potential product candidate for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\tthe efficacy and safety of the product candidate as demonstrated in clinical trials; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\trelative convenience and ease of administration;. 24. Table of Contents. <U+25CF> \t\t\tthe clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe potential and perceived advantages and disadvantages of the product candidate, including cost and clinical benefit relative to alternative treatments; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe strength of competitive products; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe strength of marketing and distribution support; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe willingness of physicians to recommend or prescribe the product; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe willingness of hospital pharmacy directors to purchase our products for their formularies; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tour ability to maintain regulatory approvals for the product candidate; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tacceptance by physicians, operators of hospitals and treatment facilities and parties responsible for reimbursement of the product; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors and government authorities; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tlimitations or warnings, including distribution or use restrictions, contained in the product’s approved labeling or an approved risk evaluation and mitigation  strategy; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe approval of other new products for the same indications; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe timing of market introduction of the approved product as well as competitive products; and \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tadverse publicity about the product or favorable publicity about competitive products.. For example, while we believe that the safety profile and certain efficacy data will allow us to differentiate Aspertec from other aspirin products in the market, we may not be able to make direct comparative claims regarding the safety or efficacy of Aspertec and other aspirin products in our promotional materials for Aspertec. Any failure by Aspertec or any other product candidate that obtains regulatory approval to achieve market acceptance or commercial success would adversely affect our business prospects.. Our ability to market Aspertec for long-term use may be hampered by lack of trial results demonstrating long-term GI-safety benefits.. While demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in mucosal damage at 42 days when evaluated using the same clinical endpoints used for early studies involving enteric-coated aspirin, Aspertec 325 mg did not demonstrate a reduction in ulcer risk over the course of a 42-day trial when more contemporary clinical endpoints were used. This lack of demonstrated long-term GI benefits could hamper our ability to market Aspertec 325 mg for long-term use.. For many new product candidates, we will rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize any of our product candidates.. If we elect to pursue new products, we will rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories and other third parties, such as contract research organizations, to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials on our product candidates in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. These third parties are not our employees and, except for restrictions imposed by our contracts with such third parties, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol and the applicable legal, regulatory, and scientific standards, and our reliance on these third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. The FDA and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as cGCPs for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials, in order to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. If we or any of our third-party contractors fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. In addition, we are required to report certain financial interests of our third party investigators if these relationships exceed certain financial thresholds and meet other criteria. Our clinical trials must also generally be conducted with products produced under cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.. 25. Table of Contents. Many of the third parties with whom we contract may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. If the third parties conducting our preclinical studies or our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations or comply with regulatory requirements we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties. This could be costly, and our preclinical studies or clinical trials may need to be extended, delayed, terminated or repeated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval in a timely fashion, or at all, for the applicable product candidate, or to commercialize such product candidate being tested in such studies or trials. If any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative third party contractors or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our contract research organizations, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.. Clinical trials for future products may be delayed or prevented.. Clinical trials may be delayed or prevented for a broad range of reasons, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDifficulties obtaining regulatory approval to begin trials; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tDelays in reaching agreements on acceptable terms with contract manufacturers and contract research organizations; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tInsufficient or inadequate supply or quality of a product candidate or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tChallenges recruiting and enrolling subjects to participate in clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including size and nature of subject population, proximity of  subjects to clinical sites, eligibility criteria for the trial, nature of trial protocol, the availability of approved effective treatments for the relevant disease and  competition from other clinical trial programs for similar indications; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tDifficulties maintaining contact with subjects after treatment, which results in incomplete data; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tReceipt by a competitor of marketing approval for a product targeting an indication that our product targets, such that we are not “first to market” with our  product candidate; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tGovernmental or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tInspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tUnforeseen safety issues, including serious adverse events associated with a product candidate, or lack of effectiveness; and \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tLack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.. 26. Table of Contents. One or more of these difficulties could result in delayed or cancelled trials and have a significant negative impact on our earnings.. Manufacturing issues may arise that could increase product and regulatory approval costs or delay commercialization.. As we scale up manufacturing of Aspertec or our other product candidates and conduct required stability testing, issues may arise involving quality, ingredient inconsistencies, product-packaging and third-party equipment malfunctions. These issues may require refinement or resolution in order to proceed with commercial marketing of Aspertec or our other product candidates. In addition, quality issues may arise during scale-up and validation of commercial manufacturing processes. Any issues in our product or delivery devices could result in increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities, delays in our regulatory approval process, increases in our operating expenses, or failure to obtain or maintain approval for our products.. We will rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply Aspertec and other product candidates for us, as well as certain raw materials used in the production thereof. If one of our suppliers or manufacturers fails to perform adequately we may be required to incur significant delays and costs to find new suppliers or manufacturers.. We currently have limited experience in, and we do not own facilities for, manufacturing our product candidates, including Aspertec. We rely upon third-party manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply our product candidates and certain raw materials used in the production thereof. Some of our key components for the production of Aspertec have a limited number of suppliers.. We will not control the manufacturing process of, and will be completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMP regulations for manufacture of our drug products. We will be relying on our contract manufacturers to successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority. In addition, although we will have no day-to-day control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel, we are nonetheless responsible for ensuring that our drug products are manufactured in accordance with cGMPs. If the facilities that manufacture our drug products fail to maintain a cGMP compliance status acceptable to the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved. The FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority could also take enforcement action with regard to the facilities or the drug products.. We do not currently have commercial supply agreements with our suppliers. In the event that we and our suppliers cannot agree to the terms and conditions for them to provide clinical and commercial supply needs, we would not be able to manufacture our product candidates until a qualified alternative supplier is identified, which could also delay the development of, and impair our ability to commercialize, our product candidates.. Our third-party suppliers may not be able to meet our supply needs or timelines and this may negatively affect our business. The failure of third-party manufacturers or suppliers to perform adequately or the termination of our arrangements with any of them may adversely affect our business.. Changes in product candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in additional costs or delay.. As product candidates are developed through preclinical studies to late-stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods and formulation, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives. Any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials conducted with the altered materials. Such changes may also require additional testing, FDA notification, or FDA approval. This could delay completion of clinical trials; require the conduct of bridging clinical trials or studies, or the repetition of one or more clinical trials; increase clinical trial costs; delay approval of our product candidates; and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue.. A key ingredient for our products is currently available from only a single provider.. One key ingredient is currently limited to a single provider, Lipoid GmbH (“Lipoid”), which supplies cGMP lecithin and is a leader in supplying high quality lipids to the global pharmaceutical industry. Lipoid developed this particular cGMP lecithin with us over a several year period, and has informed us that we are currently the only buyer of the product. We do not have a long-term contract with Lipoid for the supply of commercial quantities of this product, and there can be no assurances that Lipoid will be able to supply sufficient commercial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements at an acceptable cost.. 27. Table of Contents. We may be subject to costly product liability claims related to our products and product candidates and, if we are unable to obtain adequate insurance or are required to pay for liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limits of, our insurance coverage, a material liability claim could adversely affect our financial condition.. We face the risk that the use of our product candidates may result in adverse side effects and as a result may expose us to significant product liability claims. Although we currently have product liability insurance coverage in the amount of $5 million, our insurance may be insufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer, and we may be required to increase our product liability insurance coverage as we increase the size of our operations. We do not know whether we will be able to continue to obtain product liability coverage and obtain expanded coverage if we require it, on acceptable terms, if at all. We may not have sufficient resources to pay for any liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from, or beyond the limits of, our insurance coverage. To the extent that we are required to provide indemnities in favor of third parties, there is also a risk that these third parties could incur liability and bring a claim under such indemnities. An individual may bring a product liability claim against us alleging that one of our product candidates or products has caused an injury or is found to be unsuitable for consumer use. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability to commercialize Aspertec or future product candidates; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tdecreased demand for Aspertec or future candidates; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tregulatory investigations that could require costly recalls or product modifications; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tloss of revenue; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tsubstantial costs of litigation; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tliabilities that substantially exceed our product liability insurance, which we would then be required to pay ourselves; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tan increase in our product liability insurance rates or the inability to maintain insurance coverage in the future on acceptable terms, if at all; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe diversion of management’s attention from our business; and \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tdamage to our reputation and the reputation of our products.. Product liability claims may subject us to the foregoing and other risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.. We currently have no sales, marketing and distribution organization or history. If we are unable to establish effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into third party arrangements for sales, marketing and distribution, we may not be able to effectively market, sell and distribute our product candidates, if approved.. We are currently in the process of building our sales and marketing staff and distribution processes. If we are unable to develop a sales and marketing and distribution capability on our own or through third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our future products.  To achieve commercial success for any approved product candidate, we must either develop a sales, marketing and distribution organization or outsource these functions to third parties. If we rely on third parties for marketing and distributing our approved products, any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties, which may not be successful and are only partially within our control, and our product revenue may be lower than if we directly marketed or sold our products. We have no historical operations in this area, and if such efforts were necessary, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our future products. If we are not successful in commercializing our future products, either on our own or through third parties, any future product revenue will be materially and adversely affected.. We face substantial competition and our competitors may discover, develop or commercialize products faster or more successfully than us.. The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition from major pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide with respect to Aspertec and other product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. There are a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of product candidates that compete directly or indirectly with Aspertec. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing technologies and drug products that are more effective, safer or less costly than Aspertec or any other product candidates that we are currently developing or that we may develop, which could render our product candidates obsolete and noncompetitive.. 28. Table of Contents. Many of our competitors have materially greater name recognition and financial, manufacturing, marketing, research and drug development resources than we do. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive expertise in commercial sales, preclinical and clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for drugs. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. These organizations may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors.. Finally, the success of any product that is commercialized will depend in large part on our ability to prevent competitors from launching a generic version that would compete with such product. If such competitors are able to establish that our patents are invalid or that the generic version would not infringe upon our product, they may be able to launch a generic product prior to the expected expiration of our relevant patents, and any generic competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.. We may fail to innovate and be competitive.. We cannot state with certainty when or whether any of our products under development will be launched, whether we will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause our products to become obsolete, causing our revenues and operating results to suffer.. We expect to compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and generic pharmaceutical companies. To successfully expand our product offerings, we must continue to deliver to the market innovative, cost-effective products that meet important medical needs. Our product revenues can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace, by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products, and by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products. Our revenues can also be adversely affected by treatment innovations that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with drugs.. We may attempt to form collaborations in the future with respect to our products, but we may not be able to do so, which may cause us to alter our development and commercialization plans.. We may form strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties with respect to our programs that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. We may attempt to find strategic partners for the commercialization of Aspertec in other geographic jurisdictions and we may also attempt to find one or more strategic partners for the development or commercialization of one or more of our other product candidates. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners, and the negotiation process to secure appropriate terms is time-consuming and complex. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish such a strategic partnership for any product candidates and programs on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.. Any delays in identifying suitable collaborators and entering into agreements to develop or commercialize our product candidates could negatively impact the development or commercialization of our product candidates in geographic regions where we do not have development and commercialization infrastructure. Absent a collaboration partner, we would need to undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may not be able to develop our product candidates or bring them to market and our business may be materially and adversely affected.. 29. Table of Contents. We may be unable to realize the potential benefits of any collaboration.. Even if we are successful in entering into a collaboration with respect to the development or commercialization of one or more product candidates, there is no guarantee that the collaboration will be successful. Collaborations may pose a number of risks, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\tcollaborators may not perform their obligations as expected; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the course of development, might cause delays or  termination of the development or commercialization of product candidates, and might result in legal proceedings, which would be time-consuming, distracting and  expensive; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tcollaborators may be impacted by changes in their strategic focus or available funding, or business combinations involving them, which could cause them to  divert resources away from the collaboration; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tcollaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe collaborations may not result in our achieving revenue to justify such transactions; and \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tcollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for us to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the  applicable product candidate.. As a result, a collaboration may not result in the successful development or commercialization of our product candidates.. We will need to grow our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.. As of December 31, 2017, we had 14 employees, of which 11 are full time employees. We will need to expand our managerial, operational, financial and other resources in order to manage our operations, continue our development activities, commercialize Aspertec or other product candidates and comply with our obligations as a public reporting company. Our management and personnel, systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. Our need to effectively execute our business strategy requires that we:. <U+25CF> \t\t\tmanage our internal discovery and development efforts effectively while carrying out our contractual obligations to licensors, contractors, government agencies, any future collaborators and other third parties; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tcontinue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; and \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tidentify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees.. If we are unable to expand our managerial, operational, financial, and other resources to the extent required to manage our development and commercialization activities, our business will be materially adversely affected.. We are highly dependent on the services of our executive management team, and on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.  We may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and scientific and clinical personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. We are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff, particularly our Executive Chairman of the Board, Michael J. Valentino, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Natasha Giordano, and our Chief Financial Officer, Rita O’Connor. If we are not able to retain Mr. Valentino, Ms. Giordano or Ms. O’Connor, or are not able to attract, on acceptable terms, additional qualified personnel necessary for the continued development of our business, we may not be able to sustain our operations or grow. Although we have executed employment agreements with each member of our current executive management team, including Mr. Valentino, Ms. Giordano and Ms. O’Connor, we may not be able to retain their services as expected.. In addition, we have scientific and clinical advisors who assist us in formulating our product development and clinical strategies. These advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us, or may have arrangements with other companies to assist in the development of products that may compete with ours.. 30. Table of Contents. If we are not able to attract, retain and motivate necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our development objectives, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy.. Our business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third-party manufacturers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which may be expensive and restrict how we do business.. Our third-party manufacturers’ activities and our own activities may involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including the components of our pharmaceutical product candidates, test samples and reagents, biological materials and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturers are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. We currently carry no insurance specifically covering environmental claims relating to the use of hazardous materials, with the exception of workers’ compensation coverage for our employees. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials and waste products comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from the use, storage, handling or disposal of hazardous materials. In the event of an accident, state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of these materials and/or interrupt our business operations. In addition, if an accident or environmental discharge occurs, or if we discover contamination caused by prior operations, including by prior owners and operators of properties we acquire, we could be liable for cleanup obligations, damages and fines. If such unexpected costs are substantial, this could significantly harm our financial condition and results of operations.. We or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural disasters.. Changes to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters could affect demand for our products and services, cause disruptions in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter the availability of goods and services within the supply chain, and affect the overall design and integrity of our operations.. Our corporate headquarters is located in Houston, Texas, which in the past has experienced hurricanes. Hurricanes or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and prospects.  If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our information technology systems, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time.. If such an event were to affect our supply chain, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.. Our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.. We are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants and vendors may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates:. <U+25CF> \t\t\tFDA regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tmanufacturing standards; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tfederal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; or \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tlaws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data.. Specifically, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation.. 31. Table of Contents. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.. If we are not able to implement the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may be subject to sanctions by regulatory authorities.. As a public company, we are required to comply with significant legal, accounting, and other requirements and as such, have incurred significant regulatory compliance-related expenses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as well as rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and NASDAQ, impose various requirements on public companies, including those related to corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these requirements. Some members of management do not have significant experience in addressing these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs relative to those of previous years and make some activities more time consuming and costly.. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) provides a framework for companies to assess and improve their internal control systems. Our compliance with these requirements has required that we incur substantial accounting and related expenses and expend significant management efforts. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, or identify deficiencies that are deemed to be material weaknesses, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results.. Our ability to utilize the Company’s or Dipexium’s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the future is subject to substantial limitations and may be further limited as a result of the Merger and any new tax law changes.. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” (generally defined as a greater than 50 percent change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. Further, if the historic business of Dipexium is not treated as being continued by us for the two- year period beginning on the date of the merger (referred to as the “continuity of business requirement”), the pre-Merger net operating loss carryforward deductions become substantially reduced or unavailable for use by the surviving corporation in the transaction. It is expected that the Merger resulted in an “ownership change” of Dipexium. Accordingly, our ability to utilize the Company’s and Dipexium’s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be substantially limited. These limitations, in turn, could result in increased future tax payments for the combined organization, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the combined organization.. 32. Table of Contents. We now possess not only all of the assets but also all of the liabilities of both Dipexium and Old PLx. Discovery of previously undisclosed or unknown liabilities could have an adverse effect on the combined organization’s business, operating results and financial condition.. Acquisitions involve risks, including inaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems. As a result of the Merger, we possess not only all of the assets, but also all of the liabilities of both Dipexium and Old PLx. Although Dipexium conducted a due diligence investigation of Old PLx and its known and potential liabilities and obligations, and Old PLx conducted a due diligence investigation of Dipexium and its known and potential liabilities and obligations, it is possible that undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems may arise in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.. Risks Related to Product Safety and Efficacy Issues. Our understanding of the safety and efficacy of Aspertec could change as larger portions of the population begin using Aspertec.. Aspertec, like all NSAIDs, poses specific risks, including stomach bleeding and, for aspirin, Reyes syndrome. As the product is used by additional patients, we may discover new risks associated with Aspertec which may result in changes to the distribution program and additional restrictions on the use of Aspertec which may decrease demand for the product. Regulatory authorities have been moving towards more active and transparent pharmacovigilance and are making greater amounts of standalone safety information and clinical trial data directly available to the public through websites and other means, e.g., periodic safety update report summaries, risk management plan summaries and various adverse event data. Safety information, without the appropriate context and expertise, may be misinterpreted and lead to misperception or legal action which may potentially cause our product sales or stock price to decline. Further, if serious safety, resistance or drug interaction issues arise with our marketed products, sales of these products could be limited or halted by us or by regulatory authorities and our results of operations would be adversely affected.. Adverse safety events involving our marketed products may have a negative impact on our business.. Discovery of safety issues with our products could create product liability and could cause additional regulatory scrutiny and requirements for additional labeling, withdrawal of products from the market, and the imposition of fines or criminal penalties. Adverse safety events may also damage physician and patient confidence in our products and our reputation. Any of these could result in liabilities, loss of revenue, material write-offs of inventory, material impairments of intangible assets, goodwill and fixed assets, material restructuring charges and other adverse impacts on our results of operations. The reporting of adverse safety events involving our products or products similar to ours and public rumors about such events may increase claims against us and may also cause our product sales or stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility. Restrictions on use or significant safety warnings that may be required to be included in the label of our products — such as the risk of developing an allergic reaction to soy, stomach bleeding or Reyes syndrome, in the label for Aspertec — may significantly reduce expected revenues for this product and require significant expense and management time.. Unexpected safety or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to marketed products, whether or not scientifically justified, leading to product recalls, withdrawals, or declining sales, as well as product liability, consumer fraud and/or other claims, including potential civil or criminal governmental actions.. Our business will be highly dependent on professional and public reputation and perception, which may change, leading to volatile sales.. Market perceptions of the Company are very important to our business, especially market perceptions of our company and brands and the safety and quality of our products. If we, our partners and suppliers, or our brands suffer from negative publicity, or if any of our products or similar products which other companies distribute are subject to market withdrawal or recall or are proven to be, or are claimed to be, ineffective or harmful to consumers, then this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or share price. Also, because we are dependent on market perceptions, negative publicity associated with product quality, patient illness, or other adverse effects resulting from, or perceived to be resulting from, our products, or our partners’ and suppliers’ manufacturing facilities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or share price.. 33. Table of Contents. We must be able to adapt to changed circumstances and quickly update product labels, which could be costly or harm our reputation.. We may be required by regulatory authorities to change the labeling for any pharmaceutical product, including after a product has been marketed for several years. These changes are often the result of additional data from post-marketing studies, head-to-head trials, adverse events reports, studies that identify biomarkers (objective characteristics that can indicate a particular response to a product or therapy) or other studies or post-marketing experience that produce important additional information about a product. New information added to a product’s label can affect its risk-benefit profile, leading to potential recalls, withdrawals, or declining revenue, as well as product liability claims. Sometimes additional information from these studies identifies a portion of the patient population that may be nonresponsive to a medicine or would be at higher risk of adverse reactions and labeling changes based on such studies may limit the patient population. The studies providing such additional information may be sponsored by us, but they could also be sponsored by competitors, insurance companies, government institutions, managed care organizations, scientists, investigators, or other interested parties. While additional safety and efficacy information from such studies can assist us and healthcare providers in identifying the best patient population for each product, it can also negatively impact our revenues due to inventory returns and a more limited patient population going forward. Additionally, certain study results, especially from head-to-head trials, could affect a product’s reimbursement status or priority with certain payors, which could also adversely affect revenues.. Risks Related to Intellectual Property. If we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient intellectual property protection for Aspertec or our future product candidates, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates may be adversely affected.. We rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our technologies. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability. In particular, our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our product candidates. However, we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. We may also fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development before it is too late to obtain patent protection.. Further, the patentability of inventions, and the validity, enforceability and scope of patents in the pharmaceutical field involve complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. As a result, patent applications that we own or license may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in other foreign countries for many reasons. For example, since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates. Even if patents have issued, or do successfully issue, from patent applications, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents and patent applications we hold, license or pursue with respect to our product candidates is threatened, it could threaten our ability to commercialize our product candidates. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market any of our product candidates under patent protection, if approved, would be reduced. Changes to the patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could also diminish the value of our patents and patent applications or narrow the scope of our patent protection.. 34. Table of Contents. If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of our technology could be materially adversely affected and our business would be harmed.. In addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on confidential proprietary information — including trade secrets and know-how — to develop and maintain our competitive position. Any disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential proprietary information could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding our competitive position in our market. We seek to protect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and confidentiality agreements with consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information. However, we cannot be certain that such agreements have been entered into with all relevant parties, and we cannot be certain that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. For example, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our confidential proprietary information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems, but it is possible that these security measures could be breached. If any of our confidential proprietary information were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, we will not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. If we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, such litigation could be costly and time consuming and could prevent or delay us from developing or commercializing our product candidates.. There is a substantial amount of intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may become party to, or threatened with, litigation or other adversarial proceedings regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our technology or product candidates, including post-grant or inter-partes proceedings, interference or derivation proceedings before the USPTO. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing or future intellectual property rights. The outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have produced a significant number of patents, and it may not always be clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our product candidates, products or methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving that a patent is invalid is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Even if we are successful in defending these claims, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us.. If we are found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing or commercializing the infringing product candidate or product. Alternatively, we may be required to obtain a license from such third party in order to use the infringing technology and continue developing, manufacturing or marketing the infringing product candidate. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be nonexclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. We may also elect to enter into license agreements in order to settle patent infringement claims or to resolve disputes prior to litigation, and any such license agreements may require us to pay royalties and other fees that could be significant. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.. 35. Table of Contents. We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.. Competitors may infringe or otherwise violate our patents, the patents of our licensors, or our other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims that we assert against perceived infringers could also provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property rights. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, in whole or in part, or may refuse to stop the other party in such infringement proceeding from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly, and could put any of our patent applications at risk of not yielding an issued patent.. Post-grant or inter-parte proceedings, interference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the USPTO or any foreign patent authority may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions or other matters of inventorship with respect to our patents or patent applications. We may also become involved in other proceedings, such as reexamination or opposition proceedings, before the USPTO or its foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. An unfavorable outcome in any such proceedings could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party, or could cause us to lose valuable intellectual property rights. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms, if any license is offered at all. Litigation or other proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. We may also become involved in disputes with others regarding the ownership of intellectual property rights. For example, we jointly develop intellectual property with certain parties, and disagreements may therefore arise as to the ownership of the intellectual property developed pursuant to these relationships. If we are unable to resolve these disputes, we could lose valuable intellectual property rights.. We may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our trade secrets or confidential information, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and/or management personnel from their normal responsibilities. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of intellectual property litigation or other proceedings could negatively affect our ability to compete in the marketplace.. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but where enforcement is not as strong, or where standards are different than they are in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.. 36. Table of Contents. If we breach any of the agreements under which we license the use, development and commercialization rights to our product candidates from third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.. In addition to our own patents, an important patent family covering Aspertec is owned by UT. Our development and commercialization of Aspertec is subject to our license agreement with UT. Under our existing license agreements, we are subject to various obligations, including diligence obligations with respect to development and commercialization activities, payment obligations for achievement of certain milestones and royalties on product sales, as well as other material obligations. If we fail to comply with any of these obligations or otherwise breach our license agreements, UT may have the right to terminate the applicable license in whole or in part. Specifically, Section 4.6 of our UT License Agreement provides that “Reasonable commercial diligence shall require that [the Company] . . . . [o]n or before September 8, 2013, Sell or offer for Sale a Licensed Product.” While we believe that we have exercised reasonable commercial diligence to actively attempt such commercialization, we have not yet successfully commercialized a licensed product. As such, UT may have the option to terminate the UT License Agreement, or to limit the exclusivity of the license in certain territories.. The loss of our license agreement with UT could materially adversely affect our ability to proceed with the development or potential commercialization of Aspertec as currently planned, and could materially adversely affect our ability to proceed with any development or potential commercialization of PL1200 Ibuprofen and other NSAID programs. The risks described elsewhere pertaining to our patents and other intellectual property rights also apply to the intellectual property rights that we license, and any failure by us or our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce these rights could have a material adverse effect on our business. In some cases, we do not have control over the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of the patents that we license, and may not have sufficient ability to consult and input into the patent prosecution and maintenance process with respect to such patents, and our licensors may fail to take the steps that we believe are necessary or desirable in order to obtain, maintain and enforce the licensed patents.. Limitations on intellectual property rights may result in other threats to our competitive advantage.. The degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tothers may be able to make compounds that are similar to Aspertec or our future product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or license; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\twe or our licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by an issued patent or pending patent application that we own or license; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\twe or our licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering an invention; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tpending patent applications that we own or license may not lead to issued patents; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tissued patents that we own or license may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tour competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets; and \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\twe may not develop or in-license additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.. 37. Table of Contents. We may be subject to claims that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of former or other employers.. Some of our employees, consultants, advisors, and members of our Board of Directors, including our senior management, have been employed or retained by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these individuals have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such individuals’ former or other employer. We are not aware of any material threatened or pending claims related to these matters, but in the future litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.. Risks Related to Government Regulation. The regulatory approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining, or cause delays in obtaining, approvals for the commercialization of Aspertec 81 mg or future product candidates, which will materially impair our ability to generate revenue.. The design, development, research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, selling, import, export, advertising, promotion, and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive and evolving regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities in the United States, principally by the FDA, and foreign regulatory authorities, with regulations differing from country to country. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. While we are permitted to market Aspertec 325 mg, neither we nor any future partner are permitted to market any other product candidate in the United States until we receive regulatory approval of an NDA from the FDA.. We have not submitted an application or obtained marketing approval for doses of Aspertec other than the 325 mg dose, or for any other product candidate anywhere in the world. An NDA must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish to the FDA’s satisfaction the product candidate’s safety and efficacy for each desired indication. The NDA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product candidate. Obtaining regulatory approval of an NDA can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. In addition, failure to comply with FDA and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\twarning or untitled letters; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tcivil and criminal penalties; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tinjunctions; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\twithdrawal of approved products; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tproduct recalls; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tseizure of products; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\ttotal or partial suspension of production; and \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\trefusal to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs.. These actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to our business practices and operations, refunds of our products, the inability to obtain future approvals or marketing authorizations, and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability and financial condition.. 38. Table of Contents. Prior to receiving approval to commercialize any future product candidates in the United States or abroad, we and any applicable collaboration partners must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA and other regulatory authorities abroad, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. Preclinical testing and clinical trials are long, expensive and uncertain processes. We may spend several years completing our testing for any particular product candidate, and failure can occur at any stage. Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could also cause the FDA or us to terminate a clinical trial or require that we repeat it or conduct additional clinical trials. Additionally, data obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways and the FDA or other regulatory authorities may interpret the results of our studies and trials less favorably than we do. Even if we believe the preclinical or clinical data for a product candidate is promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Administering any product candidates to humans may produce undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of such product candidates and result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying approval of such product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may determine that certain doses of Aspertec or any other product candidate that we develop are not effective, or are only moderately effective, or have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities, safety profile or other characteristics that preclude marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. In addition, any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.. We are subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense and subject us to restrictions, withdrawal from the market, or penalties if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates, when and if approved.. An approved product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review by the FDA and, as applicable, non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Any regulatory approval that we receive for our product candidates may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing follow-up studies or surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product. In addition, if the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities approve any of our product candidates, we will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements by the FDA and other regulatory authorities with regard to labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, distribution, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and submission of safety and other post-market information. Manufacturers of our products and manufacturers’ facilities are required to comply with cGMP regulations, which include requirements related to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Further, regulatory authorities must approve these manufacturing facilities before they can be used to manufacture our products, and these facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control.. We, and our direct and indirect suppliers, remain subject to the periodic inspection of our plants and facilities, review of production processes, and testing of our products to confirm that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations. For example, the FDA conducts ongoing inspections to determine whether our record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control are in compliance with the cGMP regulations, and other FDA regulations. Adverse findings during regulatory inspections may result in the implementation of REMS programs, completion of government mandated post-marketing clinical studies, and government enforcement action relating to labeling, advertising, marketing and promotion, as well as regulations governing manufacturing controls noted above. The FDA has increased its enforcement activities related to the advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical, biological and medical device products. We will also be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. If we, any future collaboration partner or a regulatory authority discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions on that product, the collaboration partner, the manufacturer or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.. 39. Table of Contents. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling and regulatory requirements. The FDA also imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use and if we do not restrict the promotion of our products only to their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label promotion. If we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with regulatory requirements of the FDA and/or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:. <U+25CF>  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmandated modifications to promotional materials or the required provision of corrective information to healthcare practitioners;. <U+25CF>  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions imposed on the product or its manufacturers or manufacturing processes;. <U+25CF>  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions imposed on the labeling or marketing of the product;. <U+25CF>  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions imposed on product distribution or use;. <U+25CF>  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequirements for post-marketing clinical trials;. <U+25CF>  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuspension of any ongoing clinical trials;. <U+25CF>  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuspension of or withdrawal of regulatory approval;. <U+25CF>  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvoluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;. <U+25CF>  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trefusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new products or supplements to approved applications filed by us;. <U+25CF>  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;. <U+25CF>  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tseizure or detention of our products;. <U+25CF>  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trefusal to permit the import or export of our products;. <U+25CF>  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequired entry into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines (including restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue), reimbursements  for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;. <U+25CF>  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcivil or criminal penalties; or. <U+25CF>  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinjunctions.. Widely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain drug products have resulted in the withdrawal of drug products, revisions to drug labeling that further limit use of the drug products and the imposition by the FDA of REMS to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. In addition, because of the serious public health risks of high profile adverse safety events with certain products, the FDA may require, as a condition of approval, costly REMS programs.. The regulatory requirements and policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted with which we may also be required to comply. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or in other countries. If we or any future collaboration partner are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we or such collaboration partner, as applicable, will not be permitted to market our future products and our business will suffer.. 40. Table of Contents. Failure to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from marketing our products internationally.. We may seek a distribution and marketing collaborator for Aspertec or other product candidates commercialized outside of the United States. In order to market our product candidates in the European Economic Area (which comprises the 28 member states of the European Union, plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), and many other foreign jurisdictions, we or our collaboration partners must obtain separate regulatory approvals. We have had limited interactions with foreign regulatory authorities, and approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional clinical testing. In addition, the time required to obtain approval from foreign regulatory authorities may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one or more foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on our ability to obtain approval in other countries. The foreign regulatory approval process generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We may or may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and even if we file, we may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our product candidates in any market.. Healthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent our product candidates’ commercial success.. In the United States, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future revenue and profitability and the future revenue and profitability of our potential customers. Federal and state lawmakers regularly propose and, at times, enact legislation that results in significant changes to the healthcare system, some of which is intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services. The ACA contained a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse measures that have impacted and will continue to impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs.. We currently benefit from regulations that mandate full reimbursement without cost sharing for aspirin when prescribed by a health care provider. Changes to these regulations could significantly reduce reimbursement rates in a manner that negatively affects our sales.. As a result of regulations enacted as part of the ACA, we expect that Aspertec will qualify for coverage when prescribed by physicians for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with certain age-associated risks, requiring no out-of-pocket payments. While this will initially have the potential to expand the demand for Aspertec, changes to these regulations could have a significant adverse effect on reimbursement rates and, indirectly, on sales of Aspertec.. We are subject to healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement and our failure to comply with those laws could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.. Even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients’ rights are and will be applicable to our business. We could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false claims, or knowingly using false statements, to obtain payment from the federal government, and which may apply to entities that provide coding and billing advice to customers;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfederal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;. 41. Table of Contents. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal physician sunshine requirements under the ACA, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tHIPAA, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information.. In addition, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales or marketing practices. In addition, any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.. Failure to comply with domestic and international privacy and security laws can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties. The costs of compliance with these laws, including protecting electronically stored information from cyberattacks, and potential liability associated with failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to various domestic and international privacy and security regulations, including but not limited to HIPAA. HIPAA mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. In addition, many states have enacted comparable laws addressing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA.. Our international operations will be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.. As we pursue international licensing, sales and co-promotion arrangements outside the United States, we will be heavily regulated and expect to have significant interaction with foreign officials. The Company currently has indirect wholly owned subsidiaries in Chile and Ireland, which we are in process of dissolving. Additionally, in many countries outside the United States, the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers would be subject to regulation under the FCPA, which prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business.. Compliance with these regulations may be costly, and may limit our ability to expand into certain markets. Further, we may inadvertently be found to be in violation of these and other regulations, which could result in material sanctions and penalties.. 42. Table of Contents. Risks Related to Our Common Stock. The price of our common stock may be volatile.. The market price for the shares of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tability to commercialize or delays in commercializing Aspertec;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tability to commercialize or obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, or delays in commercializing or obtaining regulatory approval;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany need to suspend or discontinue clinical trials due to side effects or other safety risks, or any need to conduct studies on the long-term effects associated with the use of our product candidates;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmanufacturing issues related to Aspertec, our product candidates for clinical trials or future products for commercialization;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcommercial success and market acceptance of our product candidates following regulatory approval;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tundesirable side effects caused by product candidates after they have entered the market;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tability to discover, develop and commercialize additional product candidates;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements relating to collaborations that we may enter into with respect to the development or commercialization of our product candidates, or the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuccess of our competitors in discovering, developing or commercializing products;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstrategic transactions undertaken by us;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadditions or departures of key personnel;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct liability claims related to our clinical trials or product candidates;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprevailing economic conditions;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbusiness disruptions caused by earthquakes or other natural disasters;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory actions affecting us or our industry;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thealthcare reform measures in the United States;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsales of our common stock by our officers, directors or significant stockholders;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfuture sales or issuances of equity or debt securities by us;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in our operating results; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe issuance of new or changed securities analysts’ reports or recommendations regarding us.. In addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for pharmaceutical stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our common stock. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer. If any of our stockholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the attention of our management would be diverted from the operation of our business.. 43. Table of Contents. Our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.. As of December 31, 2017, our officers and directors, together with holders of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock and their respective affiliates, beneficially owned approximately 37.3% of our common stock. Accordingly, these stockholders have significant influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transaction. The interests of these stockholders may not be the same as or may even conflict with your interests. For example, these large stockholders could delay or prevent a change of control of our company, even if such a change of control would benefit our other stockholders, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company or our assets and might affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. The significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock due to investors’ perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.. We are an “emerging growth company” and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.. We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.. In addition, Section 102 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As an “emerging growth company,” we can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are choosing to “opt out” of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.. Future sales of our common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable for our common stock may depress our stock price.. If our existing stockholders or holders of our options or warrants sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. The perception in the market that these sales may occur could also cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.. We may be at risk of securities class action litigation.. We may be at risk of securities class action litigation. This risk is especially relevant for us due to our dependence on positive clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals of each of our product candidates. In the past, pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility, particularly when associated with binary events such as clinical trials and product approvals. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could harm our business and result in a decline in the market price of our common stock.. 44. Table of Contents. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders or involve the issuance of securities with rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.. To raise capital, we may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the then-current trading price of our common stock. As a result, our common stockholders would experience immediate dilution upon the purchase of any shares of our common stock sold at such discount. In addition, as opportunities present themselves, we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future, including the issuance of debt securities, preferred stock or common stock. Whether or not we issue additional shares of common stock at a discount, any issuance of common stock will, and any issuance of other equity securities or of options, warrants or other rights to purchase common stock may, result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline. New investors could also gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.. Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove management.. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition or a change in management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15% of the outstanding combined company voting stock from merging or combining with the combined company. Although we believe these provisions collectively will provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove then current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of management.. Provisions of our charter documents limit the liability of our officers and directors, which could limit the ability of stockholders (and outside parties) to bring claims against such officers and directors.. Our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that limit the liability of our current and former directors for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that directors of a corporation will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duties as directors, except liability for:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions; or. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.. Such limitation of liability does not apply to liabilities arising under federal securities laws and does not affect the availability of equitable remedies, such as injunctive relief or rescission.. Our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws provide that we are required to indemnify our directors to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Our bylaws also provide that, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, we shall advance expenses incurred by a director in advance of the final disposition of any action or proceeding, and permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director, employee or other agent for any liability arising out of his or her actions in that capacity regardless of whether we would otherwise be permitted to indemnify him or her under the provisions of Delaware law. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide our board of directors with discretion to indemnify our officers and employees when determined appropriate by the board. We have entered and expect to continue to enter into agreements to indemnify our directors and executive officers. With certain exceptions, these agreements provide for indemnification for related expenses including, among other things, attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these individuals in any action or proceeding. We believe that these bylaw provisions and indemnification agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers. We also maintain customary directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.. 45. Table of Contents. The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and other stockholders. Further, a stockholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers as required by these indemnification provisions. At present, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers or employees for which indemnification is sought, and we are not aware of any threatened litigation that may result in claims for indemnification..

If securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.. The trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Securities and industry analysts may never publish research on us. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage, the trading price for our stock would likely be negatively impacted. In the event one or more of the security or industry analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. In addition, if our operating results fail to meet the forecast of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline."
