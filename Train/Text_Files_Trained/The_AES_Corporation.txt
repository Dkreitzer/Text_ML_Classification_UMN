[1] "Item 1. - Business is an outline of our strategy and our businesses by SBU, including key financial drivers. Additional items that may have an impact on our businesses are discussed in Item 1A. - Risk Factors and Item 3. - Legal Proceedings.. Executive Summary. Incorporated in 1981, AES is a power generation and utility company, providing affordable, sustainable energy through our diverse portfolio of thermal and renewable generation facilities and distribution businesses. Our vision is to be the world's leading sustainable power company that safely provides reliable, affordable energy. We do this by leveraging our unique electricity platforms and the knowledge of our people to provide the energy and infrastructure solutions our customers need. Our people share a passion to help meet the world's current and increasing energy needs, while providing communities and countries the opportunity for economic growth due to the availability of reliable, affordable electric power.. In 2017, we announced the sale or retirement of 4.3 GW of mostly merchant coal-fired generation, representing 30% of our coal-fired capacity.. Future growth across our company will be heavily weighted toward less carbon-intensive wind, solar and gas generation. In 2017, AES and AIMCo completed the joint acquisition of sPower, the leading independent solar developer in the United States. sPower has 1.3 GW of solar and wind projects and an additional 10 GW of renewables in its development pipeline. sPower's robust development pipeline and expertise position AES to significantly grow our renewables portfolio in the coming years.. Growth in renewables not only provides an opportunity for direct investments in solar and wind generation, but also presents significant potential for energy storage. We are a leader in lithium-ion, battery-based energy storage, with approximately 400 MW in operation, under construction or in advanced development across seven countries. We believe that battery-based energy storage will play a critical role in an increasingly renewables-based generation mix. In January 2018, we partnered with Siemens to form Fluence, a new global energy storage technology and services company. Through a sales partnership with Siemens' global sales force, Fluence will be able to sell energy storage solutions and services in 160 countries as this market grows.. AES continues to invest in LNG opportunities to provide cleaner alternatives to countries with oil-fired power generation. Specifically, AES introduced LNG in the Dominican Republic in 2003 and currently has a 380 MW. 5. CCGT and LNG storage and regasification facility under construction in Panama.. In the United States, primarily at IPL, we completed a multi-year rate base investment in environmental upgrades to our coal plants and are in the process of re-powering several units from coal to gas.. As a result of our efforts to decrease our exposure to coal-fired generation and increase our portfolio of renewables, energy storage and natural gas capacity, we are significantly reducing our carbon dioxide emissions per MWh of generation. Under our current strategy, we anticipate a reduction of carbon intensity levels by 25% from 2016 to 2020 and by 50% from 2016 to 2030.. In February 2018, we announced a reorganization as a part of our on-going strategy to simplify our portfolio, optimize our cost structure and reduce our carbon intensity. Reflecting this simplified portfolio, we will manage our global operations separate from our growth and commercial activities.. Strategic Priorities. We have made significant progress towards meeting our strategic goals to maximize value for our shareholders..

(1)  Investments in subsidiaries excludes $2.2 billion investment in DPL. (2) Excludes working capital adjustments and growth activity prior to the close of the acquisition.. Segments. We are organized into five market-oriented SBUs: US (United States), Andes (Chile, Colombia, and Argentina), Brazil, MCAC (Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean), and Eurasia (Europe and Asia)  -  which are led by our SBU Presidents. The Eurasia SBU resulted from the merger of the Europe and Asia SBUs in Q3 2017, in order to leverage scale. Within our five SBUs, we have two lines of business. The first business line is generation, where we own and/or operate power plants to generate and sell power to customers, such as utilities, industrial users, and other intermediaries. The second business line is utilities, where we own and/or operate utilities to generate or purchase, distribute, transmit and sell electricity to end-user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial and governmental sectors within a defined service area. In certain circumstances, our utilities also generate and sell electricity on the wholesale market.. The Company measures the operating performance of its SBUs using Adjusted PTC and Consolidated Free Cash Flow (\"Free Cash Flow\"), both non-GAAP measures. The Adjusted PTC and Free Cash Flow by SBU for the year ended December 31, 2017 are shown below. The percentages for Adjusted PTC and Free Cash Flow are the contribution by each SBU to the gross metric, i.e., the total Adjusted PTC by SBU, before deductions for Corporate. See Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - SBU Performance Analysis of this Form 10-K for reconciliation and definitions of Adjusted PTC and Free Cash Flow.. 7. The following summarizes our businesses within our five SBUs.. 8. 9. 10. Overview. Generation. We currently own and/or operate a generation portfolio of 34,905 MW, including our integrated utility. Our generation fleet is diversified by fuel type. See discussion below under Fuel Costs.. Performance drivers of our generation businesses include types of electricity sales agreements, plant reliability and flexibility, fuel costs, seasonality, weather variations and economic activity, fixed-cost management, and competition.. Contract Sales  -  Most of our generation businesses sell electricity under medium- or long-term contracts (\"contract sales\") or under short-term agreements in competitive markets (\"short-term sales\"). Our medium-term contract sales have terms of 2 to 5 years, while our long-term contracts have terms of more than 5 years.. In contract sales, our generation businesses recover variable costs, including fuel and variable O&M costs, either through direct or indexation-based contractual pass-throughs or tolling arrangements. When the contract does not include a fuel pass-through, we typically hedge fuel costs or enter into fuel supply agreements for a similar contract period (see discussion below under Fuel Costs). These contracts are intended to reduce exposure to the volatility of fuel and electricity prices by linking the business's revenues and costs. These contracts also help us to fund a significant portion of the total capital cost of the project through long-term non-recourse project-level financing.. Capacity Payments in Contract Sales  -  Most of our contract sales include a capacity payment that covers projected fixed costs of the plant, including fixed O&M expenses, and a return on capital invested. In addition, most of our contracts require that the majority of the capacity payment be denominated in the currency matching our fixed costs. We generally structure our business to eliminate or reduce foreign exchange risk by matching the currency of revenue and expenses, including fixed costs and debt. Our project debt may consist of both fixed and floating rate debt for which we typically hedge a significant portion of our exposure. Some of our contracted businesses also receive a regulated market-based capacity payment, which is discussed in more detail in the Capacity Payments and Short-Term Sales sections below.. Thus, these contracts, or other related commercial arrangements, significantly mitigate our exposure to changes in power and fuel prices, currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates. In addition, these contracts generally provide for a recovery of our fixed operating expenses and a return on our investment, as long as we operate the plant to the reliability and efficiency standards required in the contract.. Short-Term Sales  -  Our other generation businesses sell power and ancillary services under short-term contracts with average terms of less than 2 years, including spot sales, directly in the short-term market or at regulated prices. The short-term markets are typically administered by a system operator to coordinate dispatch. Short-term markets generally operate on merit order dispatch, where the least expensive generation facilities, based upon variable cost or bid price, are dispatched first and the most expensive facilities are dispatched last. The short-term price is typically set at the marginal cost of energy or bid price (the cost of the last plant required to meet system demand). As a result, the cash flows and earnings associated with these businesses are more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price for electricity. In addition, many of these wholesale markets include markets for ancillary services to support the reliable operation of the transmission system. Across our portfolio, we provide a wide array of ancillary services, including voltage support, frequency regulation and spinning reserves.. Capacity Payments  -  Many of the markets in which we operate include regulated capacity markets. These capacity markets are intended to provide additional revenue based upon availability without reliance on the energy margin from the merit order dispatch. Capacity markets are typically priced based on the cost of a new entrant and the system capacity relative to the desired level of reserve margin (generation available in excess of peak demand). Our generating facilities selling in the short-term markets typically receive capacity payments based on their availability in the market. Our most significant capacity revenues are earned by our generation capacity in Ohio and Northern Ireland.. Plant Reliability and Flexibility  -  Our contract and short-term sales provide incentives to our generation plants to optimally manage availability, operating efficiency and flexibility. Capacity payments under contract sales are frequently tied to meeting minimum standards. In short-term sales, our plants must be reliable and flexible to capture peak market prices and to maximize market-based revenues. In addition, our flexibility allows us to capture ancillary service revenue while meeting local market needs.. Fuel Costs  -  For our thermal generation plants, fuel is a significant component of our total cost of generation. For contract sales, we often enter into fuel supply agreements to match the contract period, or we may hedge our. 11. fuel costs. Some of our contracts have periodic adjustments for changes in fuel cost indices. In those cases, we have fuel supply agreements with shorter terms to match those adjustments. For certain projects, we have tolling arrangements where the power offtaker is responsible for the supply and cost of fuel to our plants.. In short-term sales, we sell power at market prices that are generally reflective of the market cost of fuel at the time, and thus procure fuel supply on a short-term basis, generally designed to match up with our market sales profile. Since fuel price is often the primary determinant for power prices, the economics of projects with short-term sales are often subject to volatility of relative fuel prices. For further information regarding commodity price risk please see Item 7A. - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in this Form 10-K.. 37% of the capacity of our generation plants are fueled by natural gas. Generally, we use gas from local suppliers in each market. A few exceptions to this are AES Gener in Chile, where we purchase imported gas from third parties, and our plants in the Dominican Republic, where we import LNG to utilize in the local market.. 33% of the capacity of our generation fleet is coal-fired. In the U.S., most of our plants are supplied from domestic coal. At our non-U.S. generation plants, and at our plant in Hawaii, we source coal internationally. Across our fleet, we utilize our global sourcing program to maximize the purchasing power of our fuel procurement.. 26% of the capacity of our generation plants are fueled by renewables, including hydro, solar, wind, energy storage, biomass and landfill gas, which do not have significant fuel costs.. 4% of the capacity of our generation fleet utilizes pet coke, diesel or oil for fuel. Oil and diesel are sourced locally at prices linked to international markets, while pet coke is largely sourced from Mexico and the U.S.. Seasonality, Weather Variations and Economic Activity  -  Our generation businesses are affected by seasonal weather patterns and, therefore, operating margin is not generated evenly throughout the year. Additionally, weather variations, including temperature, solar and wind resources, and hydrological conditions, may also have an impact on generation output at our renewable generation facilities. In competitive markets for power, local economic activity can also have an impact on power demand and short-term prices for power.. Fixed-Cost Management  -  In our businesses with long-term contracts, the majority of the fixed O&M costs are recovered through the capacity payment. However, for all generation businesses, managing fixed costs and reducing them over time is a driver of business performance.. Competition  -  For our businesses with medium- or long-term contracts, there is limited competition during the term of the contract. For short-term sales, plant dispatch and the price of electricity are determined by market competition and local dispatch and reliability rules.. Utilities. AES' six utility businesses distribute power to 2.4 million people in two countries. AES' two utilities in the U.S. also include generation capacity totaling 5,373 MW. Our utility businesses consist of IPL (an integrated utility), DPL, including DP&L (transmission and distribution) and AES Ohio Generation (generation), and four utilities in El Salvador (distribution).. In general, our utilities sell electricity directly to end-users, such as homes and businesses, and bill customers directly. Key performance drivers for utilities include the regulated rate of return and tariff, seasonality, weather variations, economic activity, reliability of service and competition. Revenue from utilities is classified as regulated on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.. Regulated Rate of Return and Tariff  -  In exchange for the right to sell or distribute electricity in a service territory, our utility businesses are subject to government regulation. This regulation sets the framework for the prices (\"tariffs\") that our utilities are allowed to charge customers for electricity and establishes service standards that we are required to meet.. Our utilities are generally permitted to earn a regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the regulator based on the utility's allowed regulatory asset base, capital structure and cost of capital. The asset base on which the utility is permitted a return is determined by the regulator and is based on the amount of assets that are considered used and useful in serving customers. Both the allowed return and the asset base are important components of the utility's earning power. The allowed rate of return and operating expenses deemed reasonable by the regulator are recovered through the regulated tariff that the utility charges to its customers.. The tariff may be reviewed and reset by the regulator from time to time depending on local regulations, or the utility may seek a change in its tariffs. The tariff is generally based upon usage level and may include a pass-through of costs that are not controlled by the utility, such as the costs of fuel (in the case of integrated utilities) and/or the costs of purchased energy, to the customer. Components of the tariff that are directly passed through to the. 12. customer are usually adjusted through a summary regulatory process or an existing formula-based mechanism. In some regulatory regimes, customers with demand above an established level are unregulated and can choose to contract with other retail energy suppliers directly and pay non-bypassable fees, which are fees to the distribution company for use of its distribution system.. The regulated tariff generally recognizes that our utility businesses should recover certain operating and fixed costs, as well as manage uncollectible amounts, quality of service and non-technical losses. Utilities, therefore, need to manage costs to the levels reflected in the tariff, or risk non-recovery of costs or diminished returns.. Seasonality, Weather Variations, and Economic Activity  -  Our utility businesses are affected by seasonal weather patterns and, therefore, operating margin is not generated evenly throughout the year. Additionally, weather variations may also have an impact based on the number of customers, temperature variances from normal conditions, and customers' historic usage levels and patterns. Retail sales, after adjustments for weather variations, are affected by changes in local economic activity, energy efficiency and distributed generation initiatives, as well as the number of retail customers.. Reliability of Service  -  Our utility businesses must meet certain reliability standards, such as duration and frequency of outages. Those standards may be explicit, with defined performance incentives or penalties, or implicit, where the utility must operate to meet customer expectations.. Competition  -  Our integrated utility, IPL, and our regulated utility DP&L, operate as the sole distributors of electricity within their respective jurisdictions. IPL owns and operates all of the businesses and facilities necessary to generate, transmit and distribute electricity. DP&L owns and operates all of the businesses and facilities necessary to transmit and distribute electricity. Competition in the regulated electric business is primarily from the on-site generation for industrial customers. IPL is exposed to the volatility in wholesale prices to the extent our generating capacity exceeds the native load served under the regulated tariff and short-term contracts. See the full discussion under the US SBU.. At our distribution business in El Salvador, we face relatively limited competition due to significant barriers to entry. At many of these businesses, large customers, as defined by the relevant regulator, have the option to both leave and return to regulated service.. Development and Construction. We develop and construct new generation facilities. For our utility business, new plants may be built or existing plants retrofitted in response to customer needs or to comply with regulatory developments. The projects are developed subject to regulatory approval that permits recovery of our capital cost and a return on our investment. For our generation businesses, our priority for development is platform expansion opportunities, where we can add on to our existing facilities in our key platform markets where we have a competitive advantage. We make the decision to invest in new projects by evaluating the project returns and financial profile against a fair risk-adjusted return for the investment and against alternative uses of capital, including corporate debt repayment and share buybacks.. In some cases, we enter into long-term contracts for output from new facilities prior to commencing construction. To limit required equity contributions from The AES Corporation, we also seek non-recourse project debt financing and other sources of capital, including partners where it is commercially attractive. We typically contract with a third party to manage construction, although our construction management team supervises the construction work and tracks progress against the project's budget and the required safety, efficiency and productivity standards.. Segments. The segment reporting structure uses the Company's management reporting structure as its foundation to reflect how the Company manages the business internally. It is organized by geographic regions which provide a socio-political-economic understanding of our business. For financial reporting purposes, the Company's corporate activities are reported within \"Corporate and Other\" because they do not require separate disclosure. See Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 15 - Segment and Geographic Information included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Company's segment structure.. 13. US SBU. Our US SBU has 18 generation facilities and two utilities in the United States.. Generation  -  Operating installed capacity of our US SBU totals 12,371 MW. IPL's parent, IPALCO Enterprises, Inc., and DPL Inc. are SEC registrants, and as such, follow public filing requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

(1) As of December 31, 2017, DPL's subsidiary AES Ohio Generation, LLC owned the following plants (the Peaker Assets): Tait Units 1-7 and diesels, Yankee Street, Yankee Solar, Monument, Montpelier, Hutchings and Sidney. AES Ohio Generation jointly-owned the following plants: Conesville Unit 4, Killen and Stuart. DPL subsidiary DP&L also owned a 4.9% equity ownership in OVEC, an electric generating company. OVEC has two plants in Cheshire, Ohio and Madison, Indiana with a combined generation capacity of approximately 2,109 MW. DP&L's share of this generation is approximately 103 MW. AES' share of the AES Ohio Generation jointly-owned plants, Conesville Unit 4, Stuart and Killen, represents 1,152 MW.. (2) CDPQ owns direct and indirect interests in IPALCO which total approximately 30%. AES owns 85% of AES US Investments and AES US Investments owns 82.35% of IPALCO. IPL plants: Georgetown, Harding Street, Petersburg and Eagle Valley (new CCGT currently under construction). 3.2 MW of IPL total is considered a transmission asset.. 14. The following map illustrates the location of our U.S. facilities:. U.S. Businesses. U.S. Utilities. IPL. Regulatory Framework and Market Structure  -  IPL is subject to comprehensive regulation by the IURC with respect to its services and facilities, retail rates and charges, the issuance of long-term securities, and certain other matters. The regulatory power of the IURC over IPL's business is typical of regulation generally imposed by state public utility commissions. The IURC sets tariff rates for electric service provided by IPL. The IURC considers all allowable costs for ratemaking purposes, including a fair return on assets used and useful to providing service to customers.. IPL's tariff rates consist of basic rates and approved charges. In addition, IPL's rates include various adjustment mechanisms, including, but not limited to: (i) a rider to reflect changes in fuel and purchased power costs to meet IPL's retail load requirements, and (ii) a rider for the timely recovery of costs incurred to comply with environmental laws and regulations. These components function somewhat independently of one another, and are subject to review at the same time as any review of IPL's basic rates and charges.. IPL is one of many transmission system owner members in MISO, an RTO which maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and manages one of the largest energy and ancillary services markets in the U.S. MISO operates on a merit order dispatch, considering transmission constraints and other reliability issues to meet the total demand in the MISO region. IPL offers electricity in the MISO day-ahead and real-time markets.. Business Description  -  IPL is engaged primarily in generating, transmitting, distributing and selling electric energy to retail customers in the city of Indianapolis and neighboring areas within the state of Indiana. IPL has an exclusive right to provide electric service to those customers. IPL's service area covers about 528 square miles with an estimated population of approximately 941,000. IPL owns and operates four generating stations all within the state of Indiana. IPL's largest generating station, Petersburg, is coal-fired. The second largest, Harding Street, is natural gas-fired and uses natural gas and fuel oil to power combustion turbines. In addition, IPL operates a 20 MW battery-based energy storage unit at this location. The third, Eagle Valley, retired its coal-fired units in April 2016. 15. and the new CCGT is expected to be completed in the first half of 2018 with installed capacity of 671 MW. The fourth, Georgetown, is a small peaking station that uses natural gas to power combustion turbines.. In December 2017, IPL filed an updated petition with the IURC requesting an increase to its basic rates and charges primarily to recover the cost of the new CCGT at Eagle Valley. The requested increase is proposed to coincide with the completion of the CCGT, which is expected in the first half of 2018. IPL's proposed increase was $125 million annually, or 9%. In February 2018, IPL filed an update to the petition to reflect the newly enacted U.S. tax law, which reduced the revenue increase IPL is seeking to $97 million, or 7%. An order on this proceeding will likely be issued by the IURC by the first quarter of 2019.. Environmental Regulation  -  For information on compliance with environmental regulations see Item 1. - United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations.. Key Financial Drivers  -  IPL's financial results are driven primarily by retail demand, weather, generating unit availability, outage costs and, to a lesser extent, wholesale prices. In addition, IPL's financial results are likely to be driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:. • Rate case outcomes. • Timely completion of major construction projects and recovery of capital expenditures through base rate growth. • Passage of new legislation or implementation of or changes in regulations. Construction and Development  -  IPL's construction program is composed of capital expenditures necessary for prudent utility operations and compliance with environmental laws and regulations, along with discretionary investments designed to replace aging equipment or improve overall performance.. DPL. Regulatory Framework and Market Structure  -  DPL is an energy holding company whose principal subsidiaries include DP&L and AES Ohio Generation, LLC, both of which operate in Ohio. Electric customers within Ohio are permitted to purchase power under contract from a CRES Provider or from their local utility under SSO rates. The SSO generation supply is provided by third parties through a competitive bid process. Ohio utilities have the exclusive right to provide transmission and distribution services in their state certified territories.. DP&L is regulated by the PUCO for its distribution services and facilities, retail rates and charges, reliability of service, compliance with renewable energy portfolio requirements, energy efficiency program requirements, and certain other matters. The PUCO maintains jurisdiction over the delivery of electricity, SSO, and other retail electric services.. While Ohio allows customers to choose retail generation providers, DP&L is required to provide retail generation service at SSO rates to any customer that has not signed a contract with a CRES provider. SSO rates are subject to rules and regulations of the PUCO and are established through a competitive bid process for the supply of power to SSO customers. DP&L's distribution rates are regulated by the PUCO and are established through a traditional cost-based rate-setting process. DP&L is permitted to recover its costs of providing distribution service as well as earn a regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the regulator, based on the utility's allowed regulated asset base, capital structure and cost of capital. DP&L's rates include various adjustment mechanisms including, but not limited to, the timely recovery of costs incurred to comply with alternative energy, renewables, energy efficiency, and economic development costs. DP&L's wholesale transmission rates are regulated by the FERC.. DP&L is a member of PJM, an RTO that operates the transmission systems owned by utilities operating in all or parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, D.C., Virginia, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Indiana and Illinois. PJM also runs the day-ahead and real-time energy markets, ancillary services market and forward capacity market for its members.. As a member of PJM, AES Ohio Generation is subject to charges and costs associated with PJM operations as approved by the FERC. The capacity construct of PJM operates under the Capacity Performance (\"CP\") program, which offers capacity revenues combined with penalties for non-performance or under-performance during certain periods identified as \"capacity performance hours.\" This linkage between non- or under-performance during specific hours means that a generation unit that is generally performing well on an annual basis, may incur substantial penalties if it happens to be unavailable for service during some capacity performance hours. Similarly, a generation unit that is generally performing poorly on an annual basis may avoid such penalties if its outages happen to occur only during hours that are not capacity performance hours. An annual \"stop-loss\" provision exists that limits the size of penalties to 150% of the net cost of new entry, which is a value computed by PJM. This level is. 16. likely to be larger than the capacity price established under the CP program, so that there is potential that participation in the CP program could result in capacity penalties that exceed capacity revenues. The purpose of the CP program is to enable PJM to obtain sufficient resources to reliably meet the needs of electric customers within the PJM footprint. PJM conducts an auction to establish the price by zone.. Business Description  -  DP&L transmits, distributes and sells electricity to retail customers in a 6,000 square mile area of West Central Ohio. Ohio consumers have the right to choose the electric generation supplier from whom they purchase retail generation service; however, retail transmission and distribution services are still regulated. DP&L has the exclusive right to provide such transmission and distribution services to those customers. Additionally, DP&L procures retail SSO electric service on behalf of residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers.. In October 2017, the PUCO approved DP&L's most recent ESP. The agreement establishes a six year settlement, an updated framework to provide retail services including rate structures, non-bypassable charges, and other specific rate recovery true-up mechanisms. The settlement also establishes a three-year non-bypassable distribution modernization rider designed to collect $105 million in revenue per year which could be extended by PUCO for an additional two years.. In October 2017, DP&L transferred its interest in its coal-fired and certain other generating units to AES Ohio Generation. AES Ohio Generation, solely or through jointly-owned facilities, owns coal-fired and peaking generation units representing 2,125 MW located in Ohio and Indiana. AES Ohio Generation sells all of its energy and capacity into the wholesale market.. In January 2017, Stuart Unit 1 failed and was retired. In March 2017 it was decided to retire the Stuart coal-fired and diesel-fired generating units and Killen coal-fired generating unit and combustion turbine on or before June 1, 2018. In December 2017, AES Ohio Generation sold its undivided interests in Zimmer and Miami Fort, and entered into an agreement to sell its 973 MW of peaking capacity.. Environmental Regulation  -  For information on compliance with environmental regulations see Item 1. - United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations.. Key Financial Drivers  -  DPL's financial results are primarily driven by retail demand, weather, energy efficiency, generating unit availability, outage costs, and wholesale prices. In addition, DPL financial results are likely to be driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:. • PJM capacity prices. • Outcome of DP&L's pending distribution rate case. • Recovery in the power market, particularly as it relates to an expansion in dark spreads. • DPL's ability to reduce its cost structure. Construction and Development  -  Planned construction additions primarily relate to new investments in and upgrades to DPL's power plant equipment and transmission and distribution system. Capital projects are subject to continuing review and are revised in light of changes in financial and economic conditions, load forecasts, legislative and regulatory developments, and changing environmental standards, among other factors.. DPL is projecting to spend an estimated $359 million in capital projects for the period 2018 through 2020 with 94% attributable to Transmission and Distribution. DPL's ability to complete capital projects and the reliability of future service will be affected by its financial condition, the availability of internal funds and the reasonable cost of external funds. We expect to finance these construction additions with a combination of cash on hand, short-term financing, long-term debt and cash flows from operations.. U.S. Generation. Business Description  -  In the U.S., we own a diversified generation portfolio in terms of geography, technology and fuel source. The principal markets and locations where we are engaged in the generation and supply of electricity (energy and capacity) are the Western Electric Coordinating Council, PJM, Southwest Power Pool Electric Energy Network and Hawaii. AES Southland, in the Western Electric Coordinating Council, is our most significant generating business.. Many of our U.S. generation plants provide baseload operations and are required to maintain a guaranteed level of availability. Any change in availability has a direct impact on financial performance. The plants are generally eligible for availability bonuses on an annual basis if they meet certain requirements. In addition to plant availability, fuel cost is a key business driver for some of our facilities.. 17. AES Southland. Business Description  -  In terms of aggregate installed capacity, AES Southland is one of the largest generation operators in California, with an installed gross capacity of 3,941 MW, accounting for approximately 5% of the state's installed capacity and 17% of the peak demand of SCE. The three coastal power plants comprising AES Southland are in areas that are critical for local reliability and play an important role in integrating the increasing amounts of renewable generation resources in California.. All of AES Southland's capacity is contracted through a long-term agreement (the \"Tolling Agreement\"), expiring on May 31, 2018. In 2017, the California Public Utilities Commission approved the Resource Adequacy Purchase Agreements (the \"RAPAs\") between the SCE and AES Huntington Beach, LLC and AES Alamitos, LLC for the period of June 1, 2018 through 2020, and the SCE and AES Redondo Beach for the period of June 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018. Under the RAPAs, the generating stations will only provide resource adequacy capacity, and have no obligation to produce or sell any energy to SCE. However, the generating stations may bid energy into the California ISO markets.. Under the current Tolling Agreement, approximately 98% of AES Southland's revenue comes from availability. Historically, AES Southland has generally met or exceeded its contractual availability requirements under the Tolling Agreement and may capture bonuses for exceeding availability requirements in peak periods.. Under the Tolling Agreement, the offtaker provides gas to the three facilities thus AES Southland is not exposed to significant fuel price risk. If the units operate better than the guaranteed efficiency, AES Southland gets credit for the gas that is not consumed. Conversely, AES Southland is responsible for the cost of fuel in excess of what would have been consumed had the guaranteed efficiency been achieved. The business is also exposed to replacement power costs for a limited period if dispatched by the offtaker and not able to meet the required generation.. Environmental Regulation  -  For a discussion of environmental regulatory matters affecting U.S. Generation, see Item 1. - United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations.. Re-powering  -  In November 2014, AES Southland was awarded 20-year contracts by SCE to provide 1,284 MW of combined cycle gas-fired generation and 100 MW of interconnected battery-based energy storage. Under the contracts, all capacity will be sold to SCE in exchange for a fixed monthly capacity fee that covers fixed operating cost, debt service and return on capital. In addition, SCE will reimburse variable costs and provide the natural gas and charging electricity.. In April 2017, the California Energy Commission unanimously approved the licenses for the new combined cycle projects at AES Alamitos and AES Huntington Beach. In June 2017, AES closed the financing of $2.0 billion, funded with a combination of non-recourse debt and AES equity. The construction of this new capacity started during 2017 and commercial operation of the gas-fired capacity is expected in 2020 and the energy storage capacity in 2021.. Key Financial Drivers  -  AES Southland's contractual availability is the single most important driver of operations. Its units are generally required to achieve at least 86% availability in each contract year. AES Southland has historically met or exceeded its contractual availability.. Additional U.S. Generation Businesses. Regulatory Framework and Market Structure  -  For the non-renewable businesses, coal and natural gas are used as the primary fuels. Coal prices are set by market factors internationally, while natural gas is generally set domestically. Price variations for these fuels can change the composition of generation costs and energy prices in our generation businesses.. Many of these generation businesses have entered into long-term PPAs with utilities or other offtakers. Some businesses with PPAs have mechanisms to recover fuel costs from the offtaker, including an energy payment partially based on the market price of fuel. When market price fluctuations in fuel are borne by the offtaker, revenue may change as fuel prices fluctuate, but the variable margin or profitability should remain consistent. These businesses often have an opportunity to increase or decrease profitability from payments under their PPAs depending on such items as plant efficiency and availability, heat rate, ability to buy coal at lower costs through AES' global sourcing program and fuel flexibility.. Several of our generation businesses in the U.S. currently operate as QFs, including Hawaii, Shady Point and Warrior Run, as defined under the PURPA. These businesses entered into long-term contracts with electric utilities that had a mandatory obligation to purchase power from QFs at the utility's avoided cost (i.e., the likely costs for. 18. both energy and capital investment that would have been incurred by the purchasing utility if that utility had to provide its own generating capacity or purchase it from another source). To be a QF, a cogeneration facility must produce electricity and useful thermal energy for an industrial or commercial process or heating or cooling applications in certain proportions to the facility's total energy output and meet certain efficiency standards. To be a QF, a small power production facility must generally use a renewable resource as its energy input and meet certain size criteria.. Our non-QF generation businesses in the U.S. currently operate as Exempt Wholesale Generators as defined under EPAct 1992. These businesses, subject to approval of FERC, have the right to sell power at market-based rates, either directly to the wholesale market or to a third-party offtaker such as a power marketer or utility/industrial customer. Under the Federal Power Act and FERC's regulations, approval from FERC to sell wholesale power at market-based rates is generally dependent upon a showing to FERC that the seller lacks market power in generation and transmission, that the seller and its affiliates cannot erect other barriers to market entry and that there is no opportunity for abusive transactions involving regulated affiliates of the seller.. The U.S. wholesale electricity market consists of multiple distinct regional markets that are subject to both federal regulation, as implemented by the FERC, and regional regulation as defined by rules designed and implemented by the RTOs, non-profit corporations that operate the regional transmission grid and maintain organized markets for electricity. These rules, for the most part, govern such items as the determination of the market mechanism for setting the system marginal price for energy and the establishment of guidelines and incentives for the addition of new capacity. See Item 1A. - Risk Factors for additional discussion on U.S. regulatory matters.. Business Description  -  Additional businesses include thermal, wind, and solar generating facilities, of which our U.S. Renewables businesses and AES Hawaii are the most significant.. U.S. Renewables. sPower owns and/or operates more than 150 utility and distributed electrical generation systems across the U.S., actively buying, developing, constructing and operating renewable assets in the United States.. AES Distributed Energy develops, constructs and sells electricity generated by photovoltaic solar energy systems to public sector, utility, and non-profit entities through PPAs.. Excluding sPower wind plants, AES has 734 MW of wind capacity in the U.S., located in California, Texas and West Virginia. Mountain View I & II, Mountain View IV and Buffalo Gap I sell under long-term PPAs through which the energy price on the entire production of these facilities is guaranteed. Laurel Mountain, Buffalo Gap II and Buffalo Gap III are exposed to the volatility of energy prices and their revenue may change materially as energy prices fluctuate in their respective markets of operations.. AES manages the U.S. Renewables portfolio as part of its broader investments in the U.S., leveraging operational and commercial resources to supplement the experienced subject matter experts in the renewable industry to achieve optimal results. A portion of U.S. Solar projects and the majority of wind projects have been financed with tax equity structures. Under these tax equity structures, the tax equity investors receive a portion of the economic attributes of the facilities, including tax attributes that vary over the life of the projects. Based on certain liquidation provisions of the tax equity structures, this could result in variability to earnings attributable to AES compared to the earnings reported at the facilities.. AES Hawaii. AES Hawaii receives a fuel payment from its offtaker under a PPA expiring in 2022, which is based on a fixed rate indexed to the Gross National Product  -  Implicit Price Deflator. Since the fuel payment is not directly linked to market prices for fuel, the risk arising from fluctuations in market prices for coal is borne by AES Hawaii.. To mitigate the risk from such fluctuations, AES Hawaii has entered into fixed-price coal purchase commitments that end in December 2018; the business could be subject to variability in coal pricing beginning in January 2019. To mitigate fuel risk beyond December 2018, AES Hawaii plans to seek additional fuel purchase commitments on favorable terms. However, if market prices rise and AES Hawaii is unable to procure coal supply on favorable terms, the financial performance of AES Hawaii could be materially and adversely affected.. Environmental Regulation  -  For a discussion of environmental laws and regulations affecting the U.S. business, see Item 1. - United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations.. Key Financial Drivers  -  U.S. thermal generation's financial results are driven by fuel costs and outages. The Company has entered into long-term fuel contracts to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating prices. In. 19. addition, major maintenance requiring units to be off-line is performed during periods when power demand is typically lower. The financial results of U.S. Wind are primarily driven by increased production due to faster and less turbulent wind and reduced turbine outages. In addition, PJM and ERCOT power prices impact financial results for the wind projects that are operating without long-term contracts for all or some of their capacity. The financial results of U.S. Solar are primarily driven by the amount of sunshine hours available at the facilities, cell maintenance and growth in projects. Tax reform enacted December 22, 2017 will change the taxation of U.S. Generation's operations beginning in 2018. For additional details see Key Trends and Uncertainties in Item 7. -  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.. Construction and Development  -  Planned capital projects include the AES Southland re-powering described above. In addition to the new construction project, U.S. Generation performs capital projects related to major plant maintenance, repairs and upgrades to be compliant with new environmental laws and regulations.. Andes SBU. Generation  -  Our Andes SBU has generation facilities in three countries  -  Chile, Colombia and Argentina.

The following map illustrates the location of our Andes facilities:. Andes Businesses. Chile. Regulatory Framework and Market Structure  -  Chile has operated a single power market, managed by CISEN, since November 2017. Previously, Chile had two main power systems, the SIC and SING, largely as a result of its geographic shape and size. The SIC served approximately 92% of the Chilean population, including the densely populated Santiago Metropolitan Region, representing 75% of the country's electricity demand. The SING, which mainly supplied mining companies, served about 6% of the Chilean population, representing 25% of Chile's electricity demand.. CISEN coordinates all generation and transmission companies previously in the SIC and SING. CISEN minimizes the operating costs of the electricity system, while maximizing service quality and reliability requirements. CISEN dispatches plants in merit order based on their variable cost of production, allowing for electricity to be supplied at the lowest available cost. In the SIC, thermoelectric generation is required to fulfill demand not satisfied by hydroelectric output and is critical to guaranteeing reliable and dependable electricity supply under dry hydrological conditions. In the SING, which includes the Atacama Desert, the driest desert in the world, thermoelectric capacity represents the majority of installed capacity as hydroelectric generation is not feasible. The. 21. fuels used for thermoelectric generation, mainly coal, diesel and LNG, are indexed to international prices. In 2017, the generation installed capacity in the Chilean market was composed primarily of the following:. SIC   SING   CISEN Thermoelectric   44%   84%   54% Hydroelectric   38%    -    29% Solar   8%   11%   9% Wind   7%   3%   6% Other   3%   2%   2%. In the SIC, where hydroelectric plants represent a large part of the system's installed capacity, hydrological conditions influence reservoir water levels and largely determine the dispatch of the system's hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation plants and, therefore, influence spot market prices. Precipitation in Chile occurs principally in the southern cone mostly from June to August, and is scarce during the remainder of the year. During 2017 spot prices were also affected by a 14% increase in installed renewable energy capacity, totaling 564 MW, bringing total installed capacity to 4,719 MW.. The Ministry of Energy has primary responsibility for the Chilean electricity system directly or through the National Energy Commission and the Superintendency of Electricity and Fuels. The electricity sector is divided into three segments: generation, transmission and distribution. Generally, generation and transmission growth is subject to market competition, while transmission operation and distribution are subject to price regulation. In July 2016, modifications to the Transmission Law were enacted. This law establishes that the transmission system will be completely paid for by the end-users, gradually allocating the costs on the demand side from 2019 through 2034.. All generators can sell energy through contracts with regulated distribution companies or directly to unregulated customers. Unregulated customers are customers whose connected capacity is higher than 2 MW. Customers with connected capacity between 0.5 MW and 2.0 MW can opt for regulated or unregulated contracts for a minimum period of four years. By law, both regulated and unregulated customers are required to purchase all electricity under contract. Generators may also sell energy to other power generation companies on a short-term basis at negotiated prices outside the spot market. Electricity prices in Chile are denominated in U.S. dollars, although payments are made in Chilean pesos.. Business Description  -  In Chile, through AES Gener, we are engaged in the generation and supply of electricity (energy and capacity) in the CISEN. AES Gener is the second largest generation operator in Chile with installed capacity of 4,150 MW, excluding energy storage and TermoAndes, and a market share of approximately 18% as of December 31, 2017.. AES Gener owns a diversified generation portfolio in Chile in terms of geography, technology, customers and fuel source. AES Gener's installed capacity is located near the principal electricity consumption centers, including Santiago, Valparaiso and Antofagasta. AES Gener's diverse generation portfolio provides flexibility for the management of contractual obligations with regulated and unregulated customers, provides backup energy to the spot market and facilitates operations under a variety of market and hydrological conditions.. Our commercial strategy in Chile aims to maximize margin while reducing cash flow volatility. To achieve this, we contract a significant portion of our coal and hydroelectric baseload capacity under long-term agreements with a diversified customer base. Power plants not considered within our baseload capacity (higher variable cost units, mainly diesel and gas fired) sell energy on the spot market when operating during scarce system supply conditions, such as low hydrology and/or plant outages. In Chile, sales on the spot market are made only to other generation companies who are members of the CISEN at the system marginal cost.. AES Gener currently has long-term contracts, with an average remaining term of approximately 11 years, with regulated distribution companies and unregulated customers, such as mining and industrial companies. In general, these long-term contracts include both fixed and variable payments which are indexed to the CPI and the international price of coal. In some cases, the contracts include pass-through of fuel and regulatory costs, including changes in law.. In addition to energy payments, AES Gener also receives capacity payments to remain available during periods of peak demand. CISEN annually determines the capacity requirements for each power plant. The capacity price is fixed semiannually by the National Energy Commission and indexed to the CPI and other relevant indices.. The Chilean government allows the export of energy generated from plants in the SING to Argentina utilizing transmission lines owned by AES Gener.. Environmental Regulation  -  During 2016, the Environmental Ministry updated the Atmospheric. 22. Decontamination Plans for the Santiago, Ventanas and Huasco regions. Our plants in these regions  -  Nueva Renca, Ventanas and Guacolda  -  are evaluating operational improvements and additional investments to comply with the new requirements. As of December 31, 2017, the regulator did not issue the decree that provides the framework and time line for these investments.. Chilean law requires every electricity generator to supply a certain portion of its total contractual obligations with NCREs. Generation companies are able to meet this requirement by constructing NCRE generation capacity (wind, solar, biomass, geothermal and small hydroelectric technology) or purchasing NCREs from qualified generators. Non-compliance with the NCRE requirements will result in fines. AES Gener currently fulfills the NCRE requirements utilizing AES Gener's solar and biomass power plants and by purchasing NCREs from other generation companies. AES Gener has also sold and contracted certain water rights to companies to construct  small hydro projects to ensure longer term NCRE compliance. At present, AES Gener is in the process of negotiating additional NCRE supply contracts to meet the future requirements.. In September 2014 a new emission tax, or \"green tax\" was enacted, effective January 2017. Emissions of PM, SO2, NOx and CO2 are monitored for plants with an installed capacity over 50 MW; these emissions are taxed. In the case of CO2, the tax will be equivalent to $5 per ton emitted. PPAs originating from the SING have \"change of law\" clauses allowing the Company to pass the green tax costs to customers. Distribution PPAs originating from the SIC do not allow for the pass through of these costs; however, the costs can be passed through to unregulated customers. The Company is currently discussing the pass-through mechanism with each distribution customer.. Key Financial Drivers  -  Hedge levels at AES Gener limit volatility to the underlying financial drivers. In addition, financial results are likely to be driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:. • Dry hydrology scenarios. • Forced outages. • Changes in current regulatory rulings altering the ability to pass through or recover certain costs. • Fluctuations of the Chilean peso (our hedging strategy reduces this risk, but some residual risk remains). • Tax policy changes. • Legislation promoting renewable energy and strengthening regulations on thermal generation assets. • Market price risk when re-contracting. Construction and Development  -  AES Gener continues to advance the construction of the 531 MW Alto Maipo run-of-the-river hydroelectric plant. Alto Maipo is the largest project in construction in the SIC market. When completed, it will include 74 km of tunnel works, two caverns, 17 km of transmission lines as part of the construction, and is 90% underground. Alto Maipo has two main contractors and covers three adjacent valleys in the Chilean Andes. The project currently employs approximately 4,500 people. See Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Key Trends and Uncertainties - Alto Maipo.. Colombia. Regulatory Framework and Market Structure  -  Electricity supply in Colombia is concentrated in one main system, the SIN, which encompasses one-third of Colombia's territory, providing electricity to 97% of the country's population. The SIN's installed capacity, primarily hydroelectric (70%) and thermal (29%), totaled 16,782 MW as of December 31, 2017. The marked seasonal variations in Colombia's hydrology result in price volatility in the short-term market. In 2017, 87% of total energy demand was supplied by hydroelectric plants.. The electricity sector in Colombia operates under a competitive market framework for the generation and sale of electricity, and a regulated framework for transmission and distribution. The distinct activities of the electricity sector are governed by Colombian laws and the CREG. Other government entities have a role in the electricity industry, including the Ministry of Mines and Energy, which defines the government's policy for the energy sector; the Public Utility Superintendency of Colombia, which is in charge of overseeing utility companies; and the Mining and Energetic Planning Unit, which is in charge of expansion of the generation and transmission network.. The generation sector is organized on a competitive basis with companies selling their generation in the wholesale market at the short-term price or under bilateral contracts with other participants, including distribution companies, generators and traders, and unregulated customers at freely negotiated prices. The National Dispatch Center dispatches generators in merit order based on bid offers in order to ensure that demand will be satisfied by the lowest cost combination of available generating units.. 23. The Colombian government and regulatory entity carried out various studies to improve the market. As a result, resolutions were issued in 2017 capping spot prices to reflect the true value of thermal plants; allowing small scale self-generation and distributed generation the option to sell excess energy to the grid; and a proposal to change the methodology for determining capacity payments for existing plants based on a new auction with the objective of reducing the reliability charges.. Business Description  -  We operate in Colombia through AES Chivor, a subsidiary of AES Gener, which owns a hydroelectric plant with an installed capacity of 1,000 MW, and Tunjita, a 20 MW run-of-river hydroelectric, both located approximately 160 km east of Bogota. AES Chivor's installed capacity accounted for approximately 6% of system capacity by the end of 2017. AES Chivor is dependent on hydrological conditions, which influence generation and spot prices of non-contracted generation in Colombia.. AES Chivor's commercial strategy aims to reduce margin volatility by selling a significant portion of expected generation by bidding in public auctions for one to three year contracts, mainly with distribution companies. The remaining generation is sold on the spot market to other generation and trading companies at the system marginal cost. Additionally, AES Chivor receives reliability payments to maintain plant availability during periods of power scarcity, such as adverse hydrological conditions, in order to prevent power shortages.. Key Financial Drivers  -  Hydrological conditions largely influence Chivor's generation abilities. Maintaining the appropriate contract level, while maximizing revenue through the sale of excess generation, is key to Chivor's results of operations. Hedge levels at Chivor limit volatility in the underlying financial drivers. In addition to hydrology, financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:. • Forced outages. • Fluctuations of the Colombian peso. • Exposure to the spot market. Argentina. Regulatory Framework and Market Structure  -  Argentina has one main power system, the SADI, which serves 96% of the country. As of December 31, 2017, the installed capacity of the SADI totaled 36,505 MW. The SADI's installed capacity is composed primarily of thermoelectric generation (63%) and hydroelectric generation (32%).. Thermoelectric generation in the SADI is primarily natural gas. However, natural gas shortages in winter (June to August), lead to the use of alternative fuels, such as oil and coal. The SADI is also highly reliant on hydroelectric plants. Hydrological conditions impact reservoir water levels and largely influence the dispatch of the system's hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation plants and, therefore, influence spot market prices. Precipitation in Argentina occurs principally in the southern cone mostly from June to August.. Regulatory Framework  -  The Argentine regulatory framework divides the electricity sector into generation, transmission and distribution. The wholesale electric market is made up of generation companies, transmission companies, distribution companies and large customers who are permitted to trade electricity. Generation companies can sell their output in the spot market or under PPAs. CAMMESA manages the electricity market and is responsible for dispatch coordination. The Electricity National Regulatory Agency is in charge of regulating public service activities and the Ministry of Energy and Mining, through the Energy Secretariat, regulates system framework and grants concessions or authorizations for sector activities. In Argentina, the regulator establishes the prices for electricity and fuel and adjusts them periodically for inflation, changes in fuel prices and other factors. In these cases, our businesses are particularly sensitive to changes in regulation.. The Argentine electric market is an \"average cost\" system, with generators being compensated for fixed costs and non-fuel variable costs plus a rate of return. All fuels, except coal, are to be provided by CAMMESA. Thermoelectric natural gas plants, such as TermoAndes, are not subject to CAMMESA fuel purchases and are able to purchase gas directly from the producers.. Argentina's new administration continues introducing regulatory improvements with the intention to normalize the energy sector. Among others, Resolution 19/2017 was enacted to set higher tariffs, denominated in USD, for energy and capacity prices. The Resolution also ceased non-cash retention of margins. Likewise, long term USD denominated PPAs have been awarded to develop 9.4 GW of new capacity (thermal and renewable) through the execution of competitive auctions. During 2017, the government has continued increasing residential and industrial tariffs in order to reduce the system deficit aiming to have all subsidies removed by the end of 2019.. AES Argentina has contributed certain accounts receivable to fund the construction of new power plants under FONINVEMEM agreements. These receivables accrue interest and are collected in monthly installments over 10. 24. years once the related plants begin to operate. AES Argentina has three FONINVEMEM funds related to operational plants under which payments are being received. AES Argentina will receive a pro rata ownership interest in these plants once the accounts receivables have been fully repaid. See Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity - Long-Term Receivables and Note 6. - Financing Receivables in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further discussion of receivables in Argentina.. Business Description  -  As of December 31, 2017, AES Argentina operates 4,104 MW, representing 11% of the country's total installed capacity. The installed capacity in the SADI includes the TermoAndes plant, a subsidiary of AES Gener, which is connected both to the SADI and the Chilean SING markets. AES Argentina has a diversified generation portfolio.. AES Argentina primarily sells its energy in the wholesale electric market where prices are largely regulated. In 2017, approximately 93% of the energy was sold in the wholesale electric market and 7% was sold under contract, as a result of contract sales made by TermoAndes.. All thermoelectric facilities not subject to fuel procurement from CAMMESA, including the portion of TermoAndes plant committed to Energy Plus contracts, are able to use natural gas and receive gas supplied from Argentine sources. In recent years, gas supply restrictions in Argentina, particularly during the winter season, have affected the operation of certain plants, such as the TermoAndes plant.. Since December 2015, foreign currency controls were lifted, allowing the Argentine peso to float under the administration of Argentinian Central Bank. Over the course of 2017, the Argentine peso devalued by approximately 17%.. Tax Regulation  -  On December 29, 2017, Law 27430 was enacted in Argentina, which introduced a tax reform with several changes in the Argentine tax system, to be effective on January 1, 2018. This tax reform will reduce the statutory corporate tax rate of companies from 35% to 30% in 2018 and 2019, and 25% from 2020 onward. The law also eliminates the Equalization Tax on the distribution of earnings generated after January 1, 2018. The Equalization Tax is to be replaced with a withholding tax on dividends at the rate of 7% for 2018 and 2019, and 13% from 2020 onward.. Key Financial Drivers  -  Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:. • Forced outages. • Exposure to fluctuations of the Argentine peso. • Changes in hydrology. • Timely collection of FONINVEMEM installment and outstanding receivables (See Note 6. - Financing Receivables in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further discussion). • Gas prices for contracted generation (Energy Plus). Brazil SBU. Our Brazil SBU operates three generation businesses. Tietê is a publicly listed company in Brazil. AES controls and consolidates Tietê through its 24% economic interest.. Generation  -  Operating installed capacity of our three generation businesses totals 3,684 MW. The following table lists our Brazil SBU generation facilities:.

The following map illustrates the location of our Brazil facilities:. Brazil Businesses. Brazil Utility. Business Description  -  Eletropaulo distributes electricity to the greater São Paulo area, Brazil's main economic and financial center. Eletropaulo holds a 30-year concession that expires in 2028. AES owns 17% of the economic interest in Eletropaulo. In November 2017, Eletropaulo converted its preferred shares into ordinary shares and transitioned the listing of those shares into the Novo Mercado, which is a listing segment of the Brazilian stock exchange with the highest standards of corporate governance. Upon conversion of the preferred shares into ordinary shares, AES no longer controlled Eletropaulo and accounted for its ownership interest as an equity method investment. In December 2017, all the criteria were met for Eletropaulo to be classified as a discontinued operation.. Brazil Generation. Regulatory Framework and Market Structure  -  In Brazil, the Ministry of Mines and Energy determines the maximum amount of energy a plant can sell, called a physical guarantee, representing the long-term average expected energy production of the plant. Under current rules, physical guarantee energy can be sold to distribution companies through long-term regulated auctions or under unregulated bilateral contracts with large consumers or energy trading companies.. The ONS is responsible for managing the operation of the national grid. The ONS dispatches generators based on hydrological conditions, reservoir levels, electricity demand, fuel prices and thermal generation availability. The consequences of unfavorable hydrology are (i) thermal plants become more expensive to dispatch in the system, (ii) the need for hydro plants to purchase energy in the spot market to fulfill their contractual obligations and (iii) high spot prices. Given the importance of hydro generation in the country, the ONS sometimes reduces dispatch of hydro facilities and increases dispatch of thermal facilities to maintain reservoir levels in the system.. 26. A mechanism known as the MRE was created under ONS to share hydrological risk across MRE hydro generators. If the hydro plants generate less than the total MRE physical guarantee, the hydro generators may need to purchase energy in the short-term market. When total hydro generation is higher than the total MRE physical guarantee, the surplus is proportionally shared among its participants and they may sell the excess energy on the spot market.. Brazil has installed capacity of 156,436 MW, which is primarily hydroelectric (64%) and thermal (17%).. Business Description  -  Tietê has a portfolio of 12 hydroelectric power plants in the state of São Paulo with total installed capacity of 2,658 MW. Tietê represents approximately 10% of the total generation capacity in the state of São Paulo. Tietê operates under a 30-year concession expiring in 2029. AES owns 24% of Tietê and is the controlling shareholder and manages and consolidates this business. Tietê's strategy is to contract most of its physical guarantee requirements and sell the remaining portion in the spot market. The commercial strategy is reassessed periodically according to changes in market conditions, hydrology and other factors. Tietê generally sells available energy through medium-term bilateral contracts.. Under the concession agreement, Tietê is required to increase its capacity in the state of São Paulo by 15% (or 400 MW). In 2017, Tietê acquired two solar plants and was successful in a bid to develop a third solar project in the state of São Paulo, totaling 75% of the obligation. These assets are not subject to return at the end of the concession. Also in 2017, Tietê acquired Alto Sertão II Wind Complex (\"Alto Sertão II\") located in the state of Bahia, with an installed capacity of 386 MW.  Alto Sertão II is subject to 20-year PPAs expiring between 2033 and 2035. Through its ownership of Tietê, AES owns a 24% economic interest in Alto Sertão II.. Uruguaiana is a 640 MW gas-fired combined cycle power plant located in the town of Uruguaiana in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. AES manages and has a 46% economic interest in the plant. The plant's operations have been largely suspended due to the unavailability of gas. The plant operated for short periods of time in 2013, 2014 and 2015 when short-term supply of LNG was sourced for the facility. The plant did not operate in 2016 or 2017. AES has evaluated several alternatives to bring gas supply on a competitive basis to Uruguaiana. One of the challenges is the capacity restrictions on the Argentinean pipeline, especially during the winter season when gas demand in Argentina is very high. Uruguaiana continues to work toward securing gas on a long-term basis.. Key Financial Drivers  -  As the system is highly dependent on hydroelectric generation, electricity pricing is driven by hydrology in Brazil.  Plant availability is also a significant financial driver as in times of high hydrology AES is more exposed to the spot market. The availability of gas is also a driver for continued operations at Uruguaiana. Tietê's financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:. • Hydrology, impacting quantity of energy generated in MRE. • Demand growth. • Re-contracting price. • Asset management and plant availability. • Cost management. • Ability to execute on its growth strategy. Construction and Development  -  As part of the initiative to pursue opportunities in renewable generation, Tietê has invested in three special purpose entities slated to construct photovoltaic power plants with a total projected capacity of 91 MW, subject to 20-year PPAs. Commercial operation is expected by the end of 2018.. MCAC SBU. Our MCAC SBU has a portfolio of distribution businesses and generation facilities, including renewable energy, in five countries, with a total capacity of 3,381 MW and distribution networks serving 1.4 million customers as of December 31, 2017.. 27.

The following map illustrates the location of our MCAC facilities:. MCAC Businesses. Dominican Republic. Regulatory Framework and Market Structure  -  The Dominican Republic energy market is a decentralized industry consisting of generation, transmission and distribution businesses. Generation companies can earn revenue through short- and long-term PPAs, ancillary services, and a competitive wholesale generation market. All generation, transmission and distribution companies are subject to and regulated by the General Electricity Law.. Two main agencies are responsible for monitoring compliance with the General Electricity Law:. • The National Energy Commission drafts and coordinates the legal framework and regulatory legislation. They propose and adopt policies and procedures to implement best practices, support the proper functioning and development of the energy sector, and promote investment.. • The Superintendence of Electricity's main responsibilities include monitoring compliance with legal provisions, rules, and technical procedures governing generation, transmission, distribution and commercialization of electricity. In addition, they monitor behavior in the electric market in order to avoid monopolistic practices. In addition to the two agencies responsible for monitoring compliance with the General Electricity Law, the Industrial and Commerce Ministry supervises commercial and industrial activities in the Dominican Republic as well as the fuels and natural gas commercialization to the end users.. The Dominican Republic has one main interconnected system with approximately 3,692 MW of installed capacity, composed primarily of thermal (79%), hydroelectric (17%) and wind (4%) generation plants/farms.. Business Description  -  AES Dominicana consists of three operating subsidiaries, Itabo, Andres and Los Mina. With a total of 992 MW of installed capacity, AES has 26% of the system capacity and supplies approximately 46% of energy demand via these generation facilities. AES has a strategic partnership with the Estrella and Linda Groups (\"Estrella-Linda\"), a consortium of two leading Dominican industrial groups that manage a diversified business portfolio.. Itabo is 42.5% owned by AES. Itabo owns and operates two thermal power generation units with a total of 295 MW of installed capacity. Itabo's PPAs with government-owned distribution companies expired in July 2016. The. 29. Dominican Corporation of State Electrical Companies sponsored a bidding process, which was awarded in April 2017 for a total of 196 MW of installed capacity and secured supply and competitive pricing for actual and future distribution energy requirements.. Andres and Los Mina are owned 85% by AES. Andres has a combined cycle natural gas turbine, an energy storage solution and generation capacity of 329 MW as well as the only LNG import facility in the country, with 160,000 cubic meters of storage capacity. Los Mina has a combined cycle with two natural gas turbines, an energy storage solution and generation capacity of 368 MW. Both Andres and Los Mina have in aggregate 697 MW of installed capacity, of which 625 MW is mostly contracted until 2022 with government-owned distribution companies and large customers.. AES Dominicana has a long-term LNG purchase contract through 2023 for 33.6 trillion btu/year with a price linked to NYMEX Henry Hub. The LNG contract terms allow delivery to various markets in Latin America. These plants capitalize on the competitively-priced LNG contract by selling power where the market is dominated by fuel oil-based generation. Andres has a long-term contract to sell re-gasified LNG to industrial users within the Dominican Republic using compression technology to transport it within the country thereby capturing demand from industrial and commercial customers.. Key Financial Drivers  -  Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:. • Changes in spot prices due to fluctuations in commodity prices, (since fuel is a pass-through cost under the PPAs, any variation in oil prices will impact the spot sales for both Andres and Itabo).. • Contracting levels and the extent of capacity awarded.. • Supply shortages in the near term (next two to three years) may provide opportunities for short term upside, but new generation is expected to come online beginning 2018.. • Additional sales derived from domestic natural gas demand are expected to continue providing income and growth based on the entry of future projects and the fees from the infrastructure service.. El Salvador. Regulatory Framework and Market Structure  -  El Salvador national electric market is composed of generation, distribution, transmission and marketing businesses, as well as a market and system operator and regulatory agencies. The operation of the transmission system and the wholesale market is based on production costs with a marginal economic model that rewards efficiency and allows investors to have guaranteed profits, while end users get affordable rates. The energy sector is governed by the General Electricity Law which defines two regulatory entities responsible for monitoring its compliance:. • The National Energy Council is the highest authority on energy policy and strategy, and the coordinating body for the different energy sectors. One of its main objectives is to promote investment in non-conventional renewable sources to diversify the energy matrix.. • The General Superintendence of Electricity and Telecommunications (\"SIGET\") regulates the market and sets consumer prices. SIGET, jointly with the distribution companies in El Salvador, completed the tariff reset process in December 2017 and developed the tariff calculation applicable from 2018 until 2022.. El Salvador has a national electric grid which interconnects with Guatemala and Honduras. The sector has approximately 1,882 MW of installed capacity, composed primarily of thermal (40%), hydroelectric (29%), geothermal (11%), biomass (13%), solar (5%) and other renewable (2%) generation plants/farms.. Business Description  -  AES El Salvador is the majority owner of four of the five distribution companies operating in El Salvador (CAESS, CLESA, EEO and DEUSEM). AES El Salvador's territory covers 77% of the country and accounted for 4,124 GWh of the wholesale market energy purchases during 2017, or about 65% market share.. Construction and Development  -  As part of the initiative to pursue opportunities in renewable generation, AES El Salvador has entered into a joint venture with Corporacion Multi-Inversiones, a Guatemalan investment group, to develop, construct, and operate Bosforo, a 100 MW solar farm with an estimated cost of $158 million. 10 MW of the project are under construction and expected to become operational during the first half of 2018. The energy produced by this project will be contracted directly by AES' utilities in El Salvador.. Panama. Regulatory Framework and Market Structure  -  The Panamanian power sector is composed of three distinct operating business units: generation, distribution and transmission. Generators can enter into long-term PPAs with distributors or unregulated consumers. In addition, generators can enter into alternative supply contracts with each. 30. other. Outside of the PPA market, generators may buy and sell energy in the short-term market. Generators can only contract up to their firm capacity.. Three main agencies are responsible for monitoring compliance with the General Electricity Law:. • The SNE has the responsibilities of planning, supervising and controlling policies of the energy sector within Panama. With these responsibilities, the SNE proposes laws and regulations to the executive agencies that regulate the procurement of energy and hydrocarbons for the country.. • The regulator of public services, known as the ASEP, is an autonomous agency of the government. ASEP is responsible for the control and oversight of public services, including electricity, the transmission and distribution of natural gas utilities, and the companies that provide such services.. • The National Dispatch Center implements the economic dispatch of electricity in the wholesale market. The National Dispatch Center's objectives are to minimize the total cost of generation and maintain the reliability and security of the electric power system. Short-term power prices are determined on an hourly basis by the last dispatched generating unit. Physical generation of energy is determined by the National Dispatch Center regardless of contractual arrangements.. Panama's current total installed capacity is 2,983 MW, composed primarily of hydroelectric (57%) and thermal (38%) generation.. Business Description  -  AES owns and operates five hydroelectric plants and one thermoelectric power plant, Estrella del Mar I, representing 705 MW and 72 MW of hydro and thermal capacity, respectively and 26% of the total installed capacity in Panama.. The majority of hydroelectric plants in Panama are based on run-of-river technology, with the exception of the 260 MW Bayano plant. Hydrological conditions have an important influence on profitability. Variations in hydrology can result in excess or a shortfall in energy production relative to our contract obligations. Hydro generation is generally in a shortfall position during low inflows from January through May, AES Panama may purchase energy in the short-term market to cover contractual obligations. During the remainder of the year, energy generation is generally in excess of contractual commitments, excess generation is sold on the short-term market.. A portion of the PPAs with distribution companies will expire in December 2018, reducing the total contracted capacity in Panama from 496 MW to 430 MW. Another portion contracted through Estrella del Mar I will expire in June 2020, reducing the total contracted capacity to 350 MW through December 2030.. Key Financial Drivers  -  Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:. • Changes in hydrology which impacts commodity prices and exposes the business to variability in the cost of replacement power.. • Fluctuations in commodity prices, mainly oil, affect the cost of thermal generation and spot prices.. • Constraints imposed by the capacity of the transmission lines connecting the west side of the country with the load, keeping surplus power trapped during the wet season.. • Country demand as GDP growth is expected to remain strong over the short and medium term.. Construction and Development  -  In August 2015, AES executed a partnership agreement with Deeplight Corporation, a minority partner, to construct, operate, and maintain a natural gas power generation plant and a liquefied natural gas terminal, in order to purchase and sell energy and capacity as well as commercialize natural gas and other ancillary activities related to natural gas. As of December 31, 2017, amounts capitalized include $666 million recorded in construction-in-progress and the project is scheduled to initiate operations in the second half of 2018.. Mexico. Regulatory Framework and Market Structure  -  Mexico has a single electric grid, the National Electricity System, covering all of Mexico's territory through the Interconnected National Electricity, Baja California and Southern Baja California Systems. The market comprises generation, transmission, distribution and commercialization segments.. Three main agencies, in addition to the Ministry of Energy, are responsible for monitoring compliance with the Electric Industry Law:. • The Energy Regulatory Commission is responsible for the establishment of directives, orders, methodologies and standards oriented to regulate the electric and fuel markets.. 31. • The National Center for Energy Control, as new ISO, is responsible for managing the wholesale electricity market, transmission and distribution infrastructure, planning the network developments, guaranteeing open access to network infrastructure, executing competitive mechanisms to cover regulated demand, and setting transmission charges.. • The Federal Electricity Commission (\"CFE\") owns the transmission and distribution grids and it is also the country's basic supplier. CFE is the offtaker for IPP generators, and together with its own power units has more than 50% of the current generation market share.. Mexico has an installed capacity totaling 74 GW with a generation mix primarily comprising of thermal (71%) and hydroelectric (17%) plants.. Business Description  -  AES has 1,055 MW of installed capacity in Mexico. The TEG and TEP pet coke-fired plants, located in Tamuin, San Luis Potosi, supply power to their offtakers under long-term PPAs expiring in 2027 with a 90% availability guarantee. TEG and TEP secure their fuel under a long-term contract.. Merida is a CCGT, located in Merida, on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Merida sells power to the CFE under a capacity and energy based long-term PPA through 2025. Additionally, the plant purchases natural gas and diesel under a long-term contract with one of the CFE's subsidiaries, the cost of which is then passed through to CFE under the terms of the PPA.. AES has partnered in a joint venture with Grupo BAL to co-invest in power and related infrastructure projects in Mexico, focusing on renewable and natural gas generation. The first development, a 306 MW wind project, expects to begin construction in the first half of 2018.. Key Financial Drivers  -  Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:. • As the companies are fully contracted, improved operational performance provides additional benefits, including performance incentives and/or excess energy sales.. • Changes in the Locational Marginal Price and the Transmission High Tension Tariff.. Puerto Rico. Regulatory Framework and Market Structure  -  Puerto Rico has a single electric grid managed by PREPA, a state-owned entity that supplies virtually all of the electric power consumed in Puerto Rico and generates, transmits and distributes electricity to 1.5 million customers. The Puerto Rico Energy Commission (\"PREC\") is the main regulatory body. The commission approves wholesale and retail rates, sets efficiency and interconnection standards, and oversees PREPA's compliance with Puerto Rico's renewable portfolio standard.. Puerto Rico's electricity is 98% produced by thermal plants (47% from petroleum, 34% from natural gas, 17% from coal).. Business Description  -  AES Puerto Rico owns and operates a coal-fired cogeneration plant and a solar plant of 524 MW and 24 MW, respectively, representing approximately 9% of the installed capacity in Puerto Rico. Both plants have long-term PPAs expiring in 2027 and 2032, respectively, with PREPA. See Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Key Trends and Uncertainties - Macroeconomic and Political - Puerto Rico for further discussion of the long-term PPA with PREPA..

Regulatory Framework and Market Structure  -  The electricity sector in Bulgaria allows both regulated and competitive segments. NEK, the state-owned electricity public supplier and energy trading company, acts as a single buyer and seller for all regulated transactions on the market. Electricity outside the regulated market trades at bilaterally negotiated prices in an open market or on the day-ahead IBEX market. In March 2017, IBEX introduced an intra-day market platform. In addition, IBEX launched a platform for trading long-term contracts in Q4 2016. Effective January 1, 2018 all electricity outside regulated quotas may only be traded via the IBEX platform. Bulgaria is working with the European Commission and the World Bank on a model that will allow the gradual phase out of regulated energy prices.. Bulgaria's power sector is supported by a diverse generation mix, a stable regulatory environment, universal  access to the grid, and numerous cross-border connections in neighboring countries. In addition, it plays an important role in the energy balance on the Balkan region.. Bulgaria has 13 GW of installed capacity enabling the country to meet and exceed domestic demand and export energy. Installed capacity is 39% coal-fired and 16% nuclear.. Business Description  -  Our Maritza plant is a 690 MW lignite fuel thermal power plant commissioned in June 2011. Maritza's entire power output is contracted with NEK under a 15-year PPA, expiring in May 2026.. AES also owns an 89% economic interest in the St. Nikola wind farm with 156 MW of installed capacity. St. Nikola was commissioned in March 2010. Its entire power output is contracted with NEK under a 15-year PPA expiring in March 2025.. Our plants in Bulgaria operate under long-term PPAs with NEK, which has previously experienced liquidity issues. In April 2016, NEK paid Maritza its overdue receivables in exchange for amending the PPA and reducing the capacity payment to Maritza by 14% through the remaining PPA term. Maritza has experienced timely collection of outstanding receivables from NEK since May 2016. However, NEK's liquidity position remains subject to political conditions and regulatory changes in Bulgaria.. The DG Comp is reviewing NEK's PPA with Maritza pursuant to the European Commission's state aid rules.. 34. Maritza believes that its PPA is legal and in compliance with all applicable laws. See Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Key Trends and Uncertainties - Regulatory.. Key Financial Drivers  -  Both businesses, Maritza and St. Nikola, operate under PPA contracts. For the duration of the PPA, financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:. • Regulatory changes to the Bulgaria power market. • Results of the DG Comp review. • The availability of the operating units. • The level of wind resources for St. Nikola. • NEK's ability to meet the payment terms of the PPA contract. United Kingdom. Regulatory Framework and Market Structure  -  The electricity sector in Northern Ireland is operated by the SEM. It is based on a gross mandatory pool within which all generators with capacity higher than 10 MW must trade the physical delivery of power. Generators are centrally dispatched based on merit order and physical constraints of the system.. In addition, the SEM has a capacity payment mechanism to ensure that sufficient generating capacity is offered to the market. The capacity payment is derived from a regulated Euro-based capacity payment pool, established a year ahead by the regulatory authority. Capacity payments are based on the expected availability of a unit and are subject to volatility due to seasonal influences, demand, and the actual generation available over each trading period. In the second quarter of 2018 regulatory authorities are expected to update the market framework to reflect the integration of the SEM day-ahead and intra-day markets with EU energy markets, introduce a new competitive capacity auction, and revise arrangements for system services to incentivize flexibility. The market will be renamed I-SEM (Integrated Single Electricity Market) to reflect these changes.. Northern Ireland's power sector is supported by a diverse generation mix, a stable regulatory environment, universal access to the grid, and connections between Northern and Southern Ireland and the UK. Installed capacity in the SEM is 49% gas fired and 26% from renewable sources, resulting in sensitivity to gas prices relative to order of merit. SEM has also set a target of 40% renewable generation by 2020.. Business Description  -  AES has two generation plants in the United Kingdom, both of which are located in Northern Ireland within the Greater Belfast region. Kilroot is a 701 MW coal-fired merchant plant, with an additional 10 MW of energy storage, that bids into the I-SEM. Kilroot's coal fired units failed to clear in the first I-SEM capacity auction process. Consequently, AES announced its intent to shut down the coal units on or before May 31, 2018, pending the results of an assessment by the regulator to determine the long term needs of the Northern Ireland power grid.  Ballylumford is a 1,015 MW gas-fired plant, of which 600 MW is contracted under a PPA with Power NI Power Procurement Business expiring in 2023. The 415 MW remaining capacity is bid into the SEM market, with 310 MW subject to a supplemental Local Reserve Services Agreement with the system operator. One of Ballylumford's B-station units failed to clear the aforementioned I-SEM capacity auction; as a result, AES intends to retire that unit at the end of December 2018.. Key Financial Drivers  -  Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:. • Regulatory changes to the market structure and payment mechanisms. • Investments to maintain compliance with European Union environmental legislation. • Availability of the operating units and order of merit. • Commodity prices (gas, coal and CO2) and sufficient market liquidity to hedge prices in the short-term. • Electricity demand in the SEM (including impact of wind generation). Kazakhstan. Regulatory Framework and Market Structure  -  The Kazakhstan government has grouped generators into fifteen groups based on a number of factors, including plant type and fuel used. Each group has a fixed tariff-cap level and all generators must sell electricity at or below their respective tariff-cap levels.. Business Description  -  AES operated four plants with a total capacity of 2,776 MW. Our two hydroelectric plants, representing 1,033 MW, were operated under a concession agreement until early October 2017, when the plants were transferred back to the Republic of Kazakhstan. The remaining 1,743 MW coal-fired capacity was sold in the second quarter of 2017.. 35. Jordan. Regulatory framework and market structure  -  The Jordan electricity transmission market is a single-buyer model with the state owned NEPCO responsible for transmission. NEPCO generally enters into long term power purchase agreements with IPP's to fulfill energy procurement requests from distribution utilities. The sector is prioritizing renewable energy development, with 2,200 MW of renewable energy installed capacity expected by year 2020, 700 MW of which was already connected to the grid.. Business Description  -  In Jordan, AES has a 37% controlling interest in Amman East, a 381 MW oil/gas-fired plant fully contracted with the national utility under a 25-year PPA expiring in 2033, and a 36% controlling interest in the IPP4 plant, a 250 MW oil/gas-fired peaker plant which commenced operations in July 2014, fully contracted with the national utility until 2039. We consolidate the results in our operations as we have controlling interest in these businesses.. Construction and Development   -  AES, in conjunction with Mitsui & Co of Japan and NEBRAS Power of Qatar, have signed an agreement to construct a 52 MW solar project in Jordan. Construction of the plant has not begun, but is expected to be completed mid-2019 to coincide with the start of a PPA to provide energy to NEPCO through 2038.. India. Regulatory framework and Market Structure  -  The power sector is largely dominated by state and central government-owned generation and distribution utilities. Electricity is generally sold to state utilities under long-term PPAs. The tariffs are fixed on yearly basis by the Electricity Regulatory Commissions of the Centre and the State(s) or determined through competitive bidding process. Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission (\"OERC\") regulates the electricity purchase and procurement process for the Distribution Licensees, including the price at which the electricity from generating companies shall be procured for supply within the state of Orissa. OERC also facilitates interstate transmission and wheeling of electricity. OERC is guided by the National Electricity Policy, National Electricity Plan and Tariff Policy issued by the Government of India.. The power sector in India is composed of coal, gas, hydroelectric, renewable and nuclear energy. Total installed capacity as of December 31, 2017 was 331 GW, of which 66% is thermal generation. Renewable energy is adding capacity at a rapid pace and currently represents 18% of the total installed capacity.. Business Description  -  OPGC is a 420 MW coal-fired generation facility located in the state of Odisha. OPGC has a 30-year PPA with GRIDCO Limited, a state utility, expiring in 2026. OPGC is an unconsolidated entity and results are reported as Net equity in earnings of affiliates on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.. Construction and Development  -  AES has one 1,320 MW coal-fired project under construction and expected to begin operations by the end of 2018. As of December 31, 2017, total capitalized costs at the project level were $1.1 billion. Currently, 50% of the expansion capacity, or 660 MW, is contracted with GRIDCO for a period of 25 years. The remaining 50% of the generation capacity is proposed to be offered to GRIDCO under a new PPA.. Environmental Regulation  -  The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in India amended the Environment (Protection) Rules with stricter emission limits for thermal power plants via their notification issued in December 2015. All existing plants installed before December 31, 2003 are required to meet revised emission limits within two years and any new thermal power plants that will be operational from January 1, 2017 are required to operate with the revised emission limits. As a result of this amendment, FGD systems need to be installed in the existing OPGC units to comply with the new SO2 emissions requirements, and new design options modifications to the schedule of the expansion project have been evaluated. As these amendments will require substantial investment to meet the revised environmental guidelines across the public and private power sectors in India, amendments and implementation time lines are still under review by the Ministry of Power, Government of India. We believe the cost of complying with the new environmental regulations for particulate matters, water consumption, Sox and Nox limits will be a pass-through in the GRIDCO tariff for both the existing and expansion units.. Key Financial Drivers  -  Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:. • Operating performance of the facility. • Regulatory and environmental policy changes. • Tariff determination by the OERC. 36. Philippines. Regulatory Framework and market structure  -  The Philippines' power sector is divided into generation, transmission, distribution and supply. Generation and supply are open and competitive sectors, while transmission and distribution are regulated sectors. The ERC is an independent regulatory body performing administrative and other functions for the electric industry.. The Philippine power market is divided into three grids representing the three major island groups, Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Luzon, which includes Manila, the country's largest island, has limited interconnection with Visayas, and represents 86% of the total demand of both regions. Luzon and Visayas together have an installed capacity of approximately 18 GW. For Luzon, the largest generation sources are 50% coal and 29% natural gas.. The sale of power is conducted primarily through medium- or long-term bilateral contracts between generation companies and distribution utilities which are approved by the ERC. Distribution utilities and electric cooperatives are allowed to pass on to their end-users the bilateral contract rates, including WESM purchases, as approved by the ERC.. Business Description  -  The Masinloc plant is a 630 MW gross coal-fired plant located in Zambales, Philippines, is interconnected to the Luzon Grid, and is 51% owned by AES. More than 95% of Masinloc's current peak capacity is contracted through bilateral contracts. 430 MW is contracted with Meralco, the largest distribution company in the Philippines, under a PPA expiring in 2019. Following an ERC Order limiting power supply agreement extensions to one year, a supplemental PPA extending the contract with Meralco an additional three years was submitted for approval with the ERC. Masinloc's remaining contracts on existing units expire between 2018 and 2026. Masinloc has been granted a retail electricity supplier license from the ERC and currently markets power to contestable customers. Unlike Masinloc's contracts with distribution utilities, it's contract with contestable customers do not require ERC approval to be implemented. On December 17, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its Masinloc business. Closing is expected during the first half of 2018 subject to certain regulatory approvals.. Construction and Development  -  AES is constructing a 335 MW gross unit expansion to the Masinloc plant. The total capitalized cost as of December 31, 2017 is $394 million. The expansion unit is included in the Masinloc facilities to be sold as announced in December. The sale is expected to close in the first half of 2018.. Key Financial Drivers  -  Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:. • Operating performance of the facility. • Demand from contracted customers. • Whole sale electricity price in the market. Vietnam. Regulatory Framework and Market Structure  -  The Ministry of Industry and Trade is primarily responsible for formulating a program to restructure the power industry, developing the electricity market, and promulgating electricity market regulations. The fuel supply is owned by the government through Vinacomin, a state owned entity, and Petro Vietnam.. The Vietnam power market is divided into three regions (North, Central and South), with total installed capacity of approximately 45 GW. The fuel mix in Vietnam is composed primarily of hydropower at 35% and coal at 37%. EVN, the national utility, owns 57% of installed generation capacity.. The government is in the process of realigning EVN-owned companies into three different independent operations in order to create a competitive power market. A competitive electricity market has already been established. A pilot competitive wholesale electricity market has been developed, and will be implemented over the next five years. The retail market will undergo similar reforms after 2022. BOT power plants will not participate in the power market; alternatively the single buyer will bid the tariff on the power pool on their behalf.. Business Description  -  Mong Duong II is a 1,240 MW gross coal-fired plant located in Quang Ninh Province of Vietnam and was constructed under a BOT service concession agreement expiring in 2040. This is the first and largest coal-fired BOT plant using pulverized coal fired boiler technology in Vietnam. The BOT company has a PPA with EVN and a Coal Supply Agreement with Vinacomin both expiring in 2040.. Key Financial Drivers  -  Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to, the operating performance and availability of the facility.. 37. Financial Data by Country. See the table with our consolidated operations for each of the three years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, and property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, by country, in Note 15  -  Segment and Geographic Information included in Item 8. -  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information.. Environmental and Land-Use Regulations. The Company faces certain risks and uncertainties related to numerous environmental laws and regulations, including existing and potential GHG legislation or regulations, and actual or potential laws and regulations pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal of coal combustion residuals), and certain air emissions, such as SO2, NOX, PM, mercury and other hazardous air pollutants. Such risks and uncertainties could result in increased capital expenditures or other compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on certain of our U.S. or international subsidiaries, and our consolidated results of operations. For further information about these risks, see Item 1A. - Risk Factors - Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations; Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies; and Regulators, politicians, non-governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in this Form 10-K. For a discussion of the laws and regulations of individual countries within each SBU where our subsidiaries operate, see discussion within Item 1. - Business of this Form 10-K under the applicable SBUs.. Many of the countries in which the Company does business also have laws and regulations relating to the siting, construction, permitting, ownership, operation, modification, repair and decommissioning of, and power sales from, electric power generation or distribution assets. In addition, international projects funded by the International Finance Corporation, the private sector lending arm of the World Bank, or many other international lenders are subject to World Bank environmental standards or similar standards, which tend to be more stringent than local country standards. The Company often has used advanced generation technologies in order to minimize environmental impacts, such as combined fluidized bed boilers and advanced gas turbines, and environmental control devices such as flue gas desulphurization for SO2 emissions and selective catalytic reduction for NOx emissions.. Environmental laws and regulations affecting electric power generation and distribution facilities are complex, change frequently and have become more stringent over time. The Company has incurred and will continue to incur capital costs and other expenditures to comply with these environmental laws and regulations. See Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Capital Expenditures in this Form 10-K for more detail. The Company may be required to make significant capital or other expenditures to comply with these regulations. There can be no assurance that the businesses operated by the subsidiaries of the Company will be able to recover any of these compliance costs from their counterparties or customers such that the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would not be materially affected.. Various licenses, permits and approvals are required for our operations. Failure to comply with permits or approvals, or with environmental laws, can result in fines, penalties, capital expenditures, interruptions or changes to our operations. Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject to litigation or regulatory action relating to environmental permits or approvals. See Item 3. -  Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K for more detail with respect to environmental litigation and regulatory action.. United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations. In the U.S. the CAA and various state laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants, including SO2, NOX, PM, GHGs, mercury and other hazardous air pollutants. Certain applicable rules are discussed in further detail below.. CSAPR  -  CSAPR addresses the \"good neighbor\" provision of the CAA, which prohibits sources within each state from emitting any air pollutant in an amount which will contribute significantly to any other state's nonattainment, or interference with maintenance of, any NAAQS. The CSAPR required significant reductions in SO2 and NOX emissions from power plants in many states in which subsidiaries of the Company operate. The Company is required to comply with the CSAPR in several states, including Ohio, Indiana, Oklahoma and Maryland. The CSAPR is implemented, in part, through a market-based program under which compliance may be achievable. 38. through the acquisition and use of emissions allowances created by the EPA. The Company complies with CSAPR through operation of existing controls and purchases of allowances on the open market, as needed.. On October 26, 2016, the EPA published a final rule to update the CSAPR to address the 2008 ozone NAAQS (\"CSAPR Update Rule\"). The CSAPR Update Rule finds that NOx ozone season emissions in 22 states (including Indiana, Maryland, Ohio and Oklahoma) affect the ability of downwind states to attain and maintain the 2008 ozone NAAQS, and, accordingly, the EPA issued federal implementation plans that both updated existing CSAPR NOx ozone season emission budgets for electric generating units within these states and implemented these budgets through modifications to the CSAPR NOx ozone season allowance trading program. Implementation started in the 2017 ozone season (May-September 2017). Affected facilities began to receive fewer ozone season NOx allowances in 2017, resulting in the need to purchase additional allowances. While the Company's 2017 CSAPR compliance costs were immaterial, the future availability of and cost to purchase allowances to meet the emission reduction requirements is uncertain at this time, but it could be material if certain facilities will need to purchase additional allowances based on reduced allocations.. New Source Review (\"NSR\")  -  The NSR requirements under the CAA impose certain requirements on major emission sources, such as electric generating stations, if changes are made to the sources that result in a significant increase in air emissions. Certain projects, including power plant modifications, are excluded from these NSR requirements, if they meet the RMRR exclusion of the CAA. There is ongoing uncertainty, and significant litigation, regarding which projects fall within the RMRR exclusion. The EPA has pursued a coordinated compliance and enforcement strategy to address NSR compliance issues at the nation's coal-fired power plants. The strategy has included both the filing of suits against power plant owners and the issuance of NOVs to a number of power plant owners alleging NSR violations. See Item 3. - Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K for more detail with respect to environmental litigation and regulatory action, including a NOV issued by the EPA against IPL concerning NSR and prevention of significant deterioration issues under the CAA.. In 2000, Stuart Station received an NOV from the EPA alleging that certain activities undertaken in the past are outside the scope of the RMRR exclusion. Hutchings Station also received such an NOV in 2009. Additionally, generation units partially owned by AES but operated by other utilities have received such NOVs relating to equipment repairs or replacements alleged to be outside the RMRR exclusion. The NOVs issued to AES-operated plants have not been pursued through litigation by the EPA.. If NSR requirements were imposed on any of the power plants owned by the Company's subsidiaries, the results could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. In connection with the imposition of any such NSR requirements on IPL, the utility would seek recovery of any operating or capital expenditures related to air pollution control technology to reduce regulated air emissions, but not fines or penalties; however, there can be no assurances that they would be successful in that regard.. Regional Haze Rule  -  The EPA's \"Regional Haze Rule\" is intended to reduce haze and protect visibility in designated federal areas, and sets guidelines for determining BART at affected plants and how to demonstrate \"reasonable progress\" toward eliminating man-made haze by 2064. The Regional Haze Rule required states to consider five factors when establishing BART for sources, including the availability of emission controls, the cost of the controls and the effect of reducing emission on visibility in Class I areas (including wilderness areas, national parks and similar areas). The statute requires compliance within five years after the EPA approves the relevant SIP or issues a federal implementation plan, although individual states may impose more stringent compliance schedules.. In September 2017, the EPA published a final rule affirming the continued validity of the EPA's previous determination allowing states to rely on the CSAPR to satisfy BART requirements. All of the Company's facilities that are subject to BART comply by meeting the requirements of CSAPR.. The second phase of the Regional Haze Rule begins in 2019 and states must submit regional haze plans for this second implementation period in 2021, to continue to demonstrate reasonable progress towards reducing visibility impairment in Class I areas. States may need to require additional emissions controls for visibility impairing pollutants, including on BART sources, during the second implementation period. We currently cannot predict the impact of this second implementation period, if any, on any of our Company's U.S. subsidiaries.. National Ambient Air Quality Standards (\"NAAQS\")  -  Under the CAA, the EPA sets NAAQS for six principal pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment, including ozone, particulate matter, NOx and SO2, which result from coal combustion.  Areas meeting the NAAQS are designated \"attainment areas\" while those that do not meet the NAAQS are considered \"nonattainment areas.\" Each state must develop a plan to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the NAAQS, which may include imposing operating limits on individual plants. The EPA is required to review NAAQS at five-year intervals.. 39. Based on the current and potential future ambient standards, certain of the states in which the Company's subsidiaries operate have determined or will be required to determine whether certain areas within such states meet the NAAQS. Some of these states may be required to modify their State Implementation Plans to detail how the states will attain or maintain their attainment status. As part of this process, it is possible that the applicable state environmental regulatory agency or the EPA may require reductions of emissions from our generating stations to reach attainment status for ozone, fine particulate matter, NOx or SO2. The compliance costs of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries could be material.. On September 30, 2015, IDEM published its final rule establishing reduced SO2 limits for IPL facilities in accordance with a new one-hour standard of 75 parts per billion, for the areas in which IPL's Harding Street, Petersburg, and Eagle Valley Generating Stations operate. The compliance date for these requirements was January 1, 2017. No impact is expected for Eagle Valley or Harding Street Generating Stations because these facilities ceased coal combustion prior to the compliance date. However, improvements to the existing FGD systems at IPL's Petersburg station were required to meet the emission limits imposed by the rule. On April 26, 2017, the IURC approved IPL's request for NAAQS SO2 compliance at its Petersburg generation station with 80% of qualifying costs recovered through a rate adjustment mechanism and the remainder recorded as a regulatory asset for recovery in a subsequent rate case. The approved capital cost of the NAAQS SO2 compliance plan is approximately $29 million.. Greenhouse Gas Emissions  -  In January 2011, the EPA began regulating GHG emissions from certain stationary sources pursuant to two CAA programs: the Title V Operating Permit program and the preconstruction permitting program for certain new construction or major modifications, known as the PSD. Obligations relating to Title V permits include record-keeping and monitoring requirements. Sources subject to PSD can be required to implement BACT. If future modifications to our U.S.-based businesses' sources become subject to PSD for other pollutants, it may trigger GHG BACT requirements. The EPA has issued guidance on what BACT entails for the control of GHG and has now proposed NSPS for modified and reconstructed units (see below) that will serve as a floor (maximum emission rate) for future BACT requirements. Individual states must determine what controls are required for facilities within their jurisdiction on a case-by-case basis. The ultimate impact of the BACT requirements applicable to us on our operations cannot be determined at this time as our U.S.-based businesses will not be required to implement BACT until one of them constructs a new major source or makes a major modification of an existing major source. However, the cost of compliance could be material.. On October 23, 2015, the EPA's rule establishing NSPS for new electric generating units became effective. The NSPS establish CO2 emissions standards of 1400 lbs/MWh for newly constructed coal-fueled electric generating plants, which reflects the partial capture and storage of CO2 emissions from the plants. The NSPS for large, newly constructed natural gas combined cycle facilities is 1,000 lbs/MWh. These standards apply to any electric generating unit with construction commencing after January 8, 2014. The EPA also promulgated NSPS applicable to modified and reconstructed electric generating units, which will serve as a floor for future BACT determinations for such units. The NSPS applicable to modified and reconstructed coal-fired units will be 1,800 lbs CO2/MWh for sources with heat input greater than 2,000 MMBtu per hour. For smaller sources, below 2,000 MMBtu per hour, the standard is 2,000 lbs CO2/MWh. The NSPS could have an impact on the Company's plans to construct and/or modify or reconstruct electric generating units in some locations.. On December 22, 2015, the EPA's final CO2 emission rules for existing power plants under Clean Air Act Section 111(d) (called the CPP) also became effective. The CPP provides for interim emissions performance rates that must be achieved beginning in 2022 and final emissions performance rates that must be achieved starting in 2030. Under the CPP, states are required to meet state-wide emission rate standards or equivalent mass-based standards, with the goal being a 32% reduction in total U.S. power sector emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The CPP requires states to submit, by 2016, implementation plans to meet the standards or a request for an extension to 2018. If a state fails to develop and submit an approvable implementation plan, the EPA will finalize a federal plan for that state. The full impact of the CPP would depend on the following:. • whether and how the states in which the Company's U.S. businesses operate respond to the CPP;. • whether the states adopt an emissions trading regime and, if so, which trading regime;. • how other states respond to the CPP, which will affect the size and robustness of any emissions trading market;    and. • how other companies may respond in the face of increased carbon costs.. Several states and industry groups challenged the NSPS for CO2 in the D.C. Circuit. Pursuant to a court order issued in August 2017, the litigation is being held in indefinite abeyance pending further court order.. 40. In addition, several states and industry groups filed petitions in the D.C. Circuit challenging the CPP and requested a stay of the rule while the challenge was considered. The D.C. Circuit denied the stay and granted requests to consider the challenges on an expedited basis. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued orders staying implementation of the CPP pending resolution of challenges to the rule. On March 28, 2017, the EPA filed a motion in the D.C. Circuit to hold the challenges to both the CPP and the GHG NSPS in abeyance in light of an Executive Order signed the same day. On April 28, 2017, the D.C. Circuit issued orders holding the challenges to both rules in abeyance for 60 days, with subsequent extensions granted by the court. The most recent extension of the CPP litigation was set to expire in January 2018 but, on January 10, 2018, the EPA filed a status report requesting that the court continue to hold the case in abeyance pending the conclusion of further rulemaking on the CPP. On October 16, 2017, the EPA published in the Federal Register a proposed rule that would rescind the CPP. On December 28, 2017, the EPA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to solicit comments as EPA considers a potential rule to establish emission guidelines to replace the CPP and limit GHG emissions from existing electric generating units under Section 111(d) of the CAA.  Some states and environmental groups have opposed EPA's most recent request to continue to hold the CPP appeals in abeyance and the D.C. Circuit has not yet acted upon EPA's request.. By order of the U.S. Supreme Court, the CPP has been stayed pending resolution of the challenges to the rule. Due to the future uncertainty of the CPP, we cannot at this time determine the impact on our operations or consolidated financial results, but we believe the cost to comply with the CPP, should it be upheld and implemented in its current or a substantially similar form, could be material. The GHG NSPS remains in effect at this time, and, absent further action from the EPA that rescinds or substantively revises the NSPS, it could impact any Company plans to construct and/or modify or reconstruct electric generating units in some locations, which may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.. The Company will likely not know the answers to the above questions regarding the CPP until later in 2018 or potentially 2019. As the first compliance period would not end until 2025, and because we cannot predict whether the CPP will survive the legal challenges or be repealed or replaced through rulemaking, it is too soon to determine the CPP's potential impact on our business, operations or financial condition, but any such impact could be material.. Cooling Water Intake  -  The Company's facilities are subject to a variety of rules governing water use and discharge. In particular, the Company's U.S. facilities are subject to the CWA Section 316(b) rule issued by the EPA that seeks to protect fish and other aquatic organisms by requiring existing steam electric generating facilities to utilize the BTA for cooling water intake structures. On August 15, 2014, the EPA published its final standards to protect fish and other aquatic organisms drawn into cooling water systems at large power plants and other industrial facilities. These standards require subject facilities that utilize at least 25% of the withdrawn water exclusively for cooling purposes and have a design intake flow of greater than two million gallons per day to choose among seven BTA options to reduce fish impingement. In addition, facilities that withdraw at least 125 million gallons per day for cooling purposes must conduct studies to assist permitting authorities to determine whether and what site-specific controls, if any, would be required to reduce entrainment of aquatic organisms. This decision-making process would include public input as part of permit renewal or permit modification. It is possible this process could result in the need to install closed-cycle cooling systems (closed-cycle cooling towers), or other technology. Finally, the standards require that new units added to an existing facility to increase generation capacity are required to reduce both impingement and entrainment that achieves one of two alternatives under national BTA standards for entrainment. It is not yet possible to predict the total impacts of this recent final rule at this time, including any challenges to such final rule and the outcome of any such challenges. However, if additional capital expenditures are necessary, they could be material.. AES Southland's current plan is to comply with the California State Water Resources Board's (\"SWRCB\") Statewide Water Quality Control Policy on the Use of Coastal and Estuarine Waters for Power Plant Cooling (\"OTC Policy\") by shutting down and permanently retiring all existing generating units at AES Alamitos, AES Huntington Beach and AES Redondo Beach that utilize OTC by December 31, 2020, the compliance date included in the OTC Policy. New air-cooled combined cycle gas turbine generators and battery energy storage systems will be constructed at the AES Alamitos and AES Huntington Beach generating stations, and there is currently no plan to replace the OTC generating units at the AES Redondo Beach generating station. The execution of the implementation plan for compliance with the SWRCB's OTC Policy is entirely dependent on the Company's ability to execute on long-term power purchase agreements to support project financing of the replacement generating units at AES Alamitos and AES Huntington Beach. The SWRCB is currently reviewing the implementation plan and latest information on OTC generating unit retirement dates and new generation availability to evaluate the impact on electrical system reliability, which could result in the extension of OTC compliance dates for specific units. The Company's California subsidiaries have signed 20-year term power purchase agreements with Southern California. 41. Edison for the new generating capacity which have been approved by the California Public Utilities Commission. Construction of new generating capacity began in June 2017 at AES Huntington Beach and July 2017 at AES Alamitos. Construction at both sites is on schedule and will require the following existing OTC units to retire earlier than December 31, 2020 to provide interconnection capacity and/or emissions credits prior to startup of the new generating units:. • Redondo Beach Unit 7 - September 30, 2019. • Huntington Beach Unit 1 - December 31, 2019. • Alamitos Units 1, 2, and 6 - December 31, 2019. The remaining AES OTC generating units in California will be shutdown and permanently retired by December 31, 2020.. Power plants are required to comply with the more stringent of state or federal requirements. At present, the California state requirements are more stringent and have earlier compliance dates than the federal EPA requirements, and are therefore applicable to the Company's California assets. Challenges to the federal EPA's rule have been filed and consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, although implementation of the rule has not been stayed while the challenges proceed. The Company anticipates once-through cooling and CWA Section 316(b) compliance regulations and costs would have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.. Water Discharges  -  On June 29, 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a final rule defining federal jurisdiction over waters of the U.S. This rule, which became effective on August 28, 2015, may expand or otherwise change the number and types of waters or features subject to federal permitting. On October 9, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an order to temporarily stay the \"Waters of the U.S.\" rule nationwide while that court determined whether it had authority to hear the challenges to the rule. The order was in response to challenges brought by 18 states and followed an August 2015 court decision in the U.S. District Court of North Dakota to stay the rule in 13 other states. On January 22, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that challenges to the rule must be reviewed in U.S. district courts and remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit with instructions to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction. That action would lift the nationwide stay of the rule, leaving the stay in place only for those 13 states addressed in the order issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of North Dakota. On January 31, 2018, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced a rule that will delay the effective date of the \"Waters of the U.S.\" rule by two years from the date the rule is published in the Federal Register. On June 27, 2017, the EPA proposed a rule that would rescind the \"Waters of the U.S.\" rule and re-codify the definition of \"Waters of the United States\" that existed prior to the 2015 rule. We cannot predict the outcome of the judicial challenges to the rule or the regulatory process to rescind the rule, but if the \"Waters of the U.S.\" rule is ultimately implemented in its current or substantially similar form and survives the legal challenges, it could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.. Certain of the Company's U.S.-based businesses are subject to National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits that regulate specific industrial waste water and storm water discharges to the waters of the U.S. under the CWA. On January 7, 2013, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency issued an NPDES permit for J.M. Stuart Station, which included a compliance schedule for performing a study to justify an alternate thermal limitation or take undefined measures to meet certain temperature limits. On February 1, 2013, DPL appealed various aspects of the final permit. As a result of DPL's decision to retire Stuart generating station, we do not expect a material impact.. On August 28, 2012, the IDEM issued NPDES permits to the IPL Petersburg, Harding Street and Eagle Valley generating stations, which became effective in October 2012. These permits set new water quality-based effluent discharge limits for the Harding Street and Petersburg facilities, as well as monitoring and other requirements designed to protect aquatic life, with full compliance required by October 2015. The extended compliance deadline was September 29, 2017 for IPL's Harding Street and Petersburg facilities through agreed orders with IDEM. The deadline for Petersburg to commission a portion of the treatment system was subsequently extended to April 11, 2018.. On November 3, 2015, the EPA published its final ELG rule to reduce toxic pollutants discharged into waters of the U.S. by power plants. These effluent limitations for existing and new sources include dry handling of fly ash, closed-loop or dry handling of bottom ash and more stringent effluent limitations for flue gas de-sulfurization wastewater. The required compliance time lines for existing sources was to be established between November 1, 2018 and December 31, 2023. On September 18, 2017, the EPA published a final rule delaying certain compliance. 42. dates of the ELG rule for two years while it administratively reconsiders the rule. IPL has installed a dry bottom ash handling system in response to the CCR rule described below in advance of the ELG compliance date. As a result of the decision to retire Stuart and Killen generating stations, we do not expect the ELG rule to have a material impact on these two stations. While we are still evaluating the effects of the rule on our other U.S. businesses, we anticipate that the implementation of its current requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and a postponement or reconsideration of the rule that leads to less stringent requirements would likely offset some or all of the adverse effects of the rule.. Selenium Rule  -  In June 2016, the EPA published the final national chronic aquatic life criterion for the pollutant Selenium in fresh water. NPDES permits may be updated to include Selenium water quality based effluent limits based on a site specific evaluation process which includes determining if there is a reasonable potential to exceed the revised final Selenium water quality standards for the specific receiving water body utilizing actual and/or project discharge information for the generating facilities. As a result, it is not yet possible to predict the total impacts of this final rule at this time, including any challenges to such final rule and the outcome of any such challenges. However, if additional capital expenditures are necessary, they could be material. IPL would seek recovery of these capital expenditures; however, there is no guarantee it would be successful in this regard.. Waste Management  -  In the course of operations, the Company's facilities generate solid and liquid waste materials requiring eventual disposal or processing. With the exception of coal combustion residuals (\"CCR\"), the wastes are not usually physically disposed of on our property, but are shipped off site for final disposal, treatment or recycling. CCR, which consists of bottom ash, fly ash and air pollution control wastes, is disposed of at some of our coal-fired power generation plant sites using engineered, permitted landfills. Waste materials generated at our electric power and distribution facilities may include asbestos, CCR, oil, scrap metal, rubbish, small quantities of industrial hazardous wastes such as spent solvents, tree and land clearing wastes and polychlorinated biphenyl contaminated liquids and solids. The Company endeavors to ensure that all of its solid and liquid wastes are disposed of in accordance with applicable national, regional, state and local regulations. On October 19, 2015, an EPA rule regulating CCR under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as nonhazardous solid waste became effective. The rule established nationally applicable minimum criteria for the disposal of CCR in new and currently operating landfills and surface impoundments, and may impose closure and/or corrective action requirements for existing CCR landfills and impoundments under certain specified conditions. The primary enforcement mechanisms under this regulation would be actions commenced by the states and private lawsuits. On December 16, 2016, President Obama signed into law the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (\"WIN Act\"), which includes provisions to implement the CCR rule through a state permitting program, or if the state chooses not to participate, a possible federal permit program. On September 13, 2017, the EPA indicated that it would reconsider certain provisions of the CCR Rule in response to two petitions it received to reconsider the final rule. On November 7, 2017, the EPA requested that legal challenges be held in abeyance and certain provisions of the rule be remanded without vacatur. It is too early to determine whether the results of the groundwater monitoring data or the outcome of CCR litigation or a potential CCR Remand Rule may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.. The existing ash ponds at IPL's Petersburg Station do not meet certain structural stability requirements set forth in the CCR rule. IDEM has extended IPL's deadline to comply with the requirements or cease use of the ash ponds to April 11, 2018.. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980  -  This act, also know as \"Superfund,\" may be the source of claims against certain of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries from time to time. There is ongoing litigation at a site known as the South Dayton Landfill where a group of companies already recognized as potentially responsible parties have sued DP&L and other unrelated entities seeking a contribution toward the costs of assessment and remediation. DP&L is actively opposing such claims. In 2003, DP&L received notice that the EPA considers DP&L to be a potentially responsible party at the Tremont City landfill Superfund site. The EPA has taken no further action with respect to DP&L since 2003 regarding the Tremont City landfill. The Company is unable to determine whether there will be any liability, or the size of any liability that may ultimately be assessed against DP&L at these two sites, but any such liability could be material to DP&L.. Unit Retirement and Replacement Generation  -  In addition to the five oil-fired peaking units IPL retired in the second quarter of 2013, the four coal-fired units at Eagle Valley were retired in April 2016. To replace this generation, IPL received approval from the IURC in May 2014 to build a 644 to 685 MW CCGT at its Eagle Valley Station site in Indiana and refuel its Harding Street Station Units 5 and 6 from coal to natural gas (approximately 100 MW net capacity each) with a total budget of $655 million. The current estimated cost of these projects is $655 million. IPL was granted authority to accrue post in-service allowance for debt and equity funds used during construction, and to defer the recognition of depreciation expense of the CCGT and refueling project. The costs to. 43. build and operate the CCGT and the refueling project, other than fuel costs, will not be recoverable by IPL through rates until the conclusion of a base rate case proceeding with the IURC after construction is completed. The CCGT is expected to be completed in the first half of 2018, and the refueling project was completed in December 2015..

You should consider carefully the following risks, along with the other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties also may adversely affect our business and. 45. operations, including those discussed in Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K. If any of the following events actually occur, our business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.. We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different, sometimes materially different, than we presently anticipate. The categories of risk we have identified in Item 1A. - Risk Factors of this Form 10-K include the following:. • risks related to our high level of indebtedness;. • risks associated with our ability to raise needed capital;. • external risks associated with revenue and earnings volatility;. • risks associated with our operations; and. • risks associated with governmental regulation and laws.. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.. Risks Related to our High Level of Indebtedness. We have a significant amount of debt, a large percentage of which is secured, which could adversely affect our business and the ability to fulfill our obligations.. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $20 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis. All outstanding borrowings, if any, under The AES Corporation's senior secured credit facility and secured term loan are secured by certain of our assets, including the pledge of capital stock of many of The AES Corporation's directly held subsidiaries. Most of the debt of The AES Corporation's subsidiaries is secured by substantially all of the assets of those subsidiaries. Since we have such a high level of debt, a substantial portion of cash flow from operations must be used to make payments on this debt. Furthermore, since a significant percentage of our assets are used to secure this debt, this reduces the amount of collateral available for future secured debt or credit support and reduces our flexibility in operating these secured assets. This high level of indebtedness and related security could have other important consequences to us and our investors, including:. • making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations at the holding company and/or individual subsidiaries;. • increasing our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions, including but not limited to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices;. • reducing the availability of cash flow to fund other corporate purposes and grow our business;. • limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;. • placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and. • limiting, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to such indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock.. The agreements governing our indebtedness, including the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, limit, but do not prohibit the incurrence of additional indebtedness. To the extent we become more leveraged, the risks described above would increase. Further, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Accordingly, our cash flows may not be sufficient to repay at maturity all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and, in that event, we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, raise equity or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance our debt as it becomes due. See Note 10. - Debt included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for a schedule of our debt maturities.. The AES Corporation is a holding company and its ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness, including its public debt securities, is dependent upon the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries by way of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise.. The AES Corporation is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Almost all of The AES Corporation's cash flow is generated by the operating activities of its subsidiaries. Therefore, The AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund its other obligations is dependent not only on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate cash, but also on the ability of the subsidiaries to distribute cash to it in the form of dividends, fees, interest, tax sharing payments, loans or otherwise.. 46. However, our subsidiaries face various restrictions in their ability to distribute cash to The AES Corporation. Most of the subsidiaries are obligated, pursuant to loan agreements, indentures or non-recourse financing arrangements, to satisfy certain restricted payment covenants or other conditions before they may make distributions to The AES Corporation, if at all. Business performance and local accounting and tax rules may also limit dividend distributions. Subsidiaries in foreign countries may also be prevented from distributing funds to The AES Corporation as a result of foreign governments restricting the repatriation of funds or the conversion of currencies.. The AES Corporation's subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, unless they have expressly guaranteed any of The AES Corporation's indebtedness, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to such debt or to make any funds available whether by dividends, fees, loans or other payments.. Even though The AES Corporation is a holding company, existing and potential future defaults by subsidiaries or affiliates could adversely affect The AES Corporation.. We attempt to finance our domestic and foreign projects primarily under loan agreements and related documents which, except as noted below, require the loans to be repaid solely from the project's revenues and provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of that project subsidiary or affiliate. This type of financing is usually referred to as non-recourse debt or \"non-recourse financing.\" In some non-recourse financings, The AES Corporation has explicitly agreed to undertake certain limited obligations and contingent liabilities, most of which by their terms will only be effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence of future events. These obligations and liabilities take the form of guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, letter of credit reimbursement agreements and agreements to pay, in certain circumstances, the project lenders or other parties.. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $20 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, of which approximately $4.6 billion was recourse debt of The AES Corporation and approximately $15.3 billion was non-recourse debt. In addition, we have outstanding guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, and other credit support commitments which are further described in this Form 10-K in Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity - Parent Company Liquidity.. Some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. The total debt classified as current in our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to such defaults was $1 billion as of December 31, 2017. While the lenders under our non-recourse financings generally do not have direct recourse to The AES Corporation (other than to the extent of any credit support given by The AES Corporation), defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for The AES Corporation, including, without limitation:. • reducing The AES Corporation's receipt of subsidiary dividends, fees, interest payments, loans and other sources of cash since the project subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to The AES Corporation during the pendency of any default;. • under certain circumstances, triggering The AES Corporation's obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support which The AES Corporation has provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary;. • triggering defaults in The AES Corporation's outstanding debt. For example, The AES Corporation's senior secured credit facility, secured term loan, and outstanding senior notes include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. In addition, The AES Corporation's senior secured credit facility includes certain events of default relating to accelerations of outstanding material debt of material subsidiaries or any subsidiaries that in the aggregate constitute a material subsidiary; or. • foreclosure on the assets that are pledged under the non-recourse loans, resulting in write-downs of assets and eliminating any and all potential future benefits derived from those assets.. None of the projects that are currently in default are owned by subsidiaries that individually or in the aggregate meet the applicable standard of materiality in The AES Corporation's senior secured credit facility or other debt agreements in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under such indebtedness. However, as a result of future mix of distributions, write-down of assets, dispositions and other matters that affect our financial position and results of operations, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries, individually or in the aggregate, could fall within the applicable standard of materiality and thereby upon an acceleration of such. 47. subsidiary's debt, trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under The AES Corporation's senior secured credit facility or other indebtedness of The AES Corporation.. Risks Associated with our Ability to Raise Needed Capital. The AES Corporation, or the Parent Company, has significant cash requirements and limited sources of liquidity.. The AES Corporation requires cash primarily to fund:. • principal repayments of debt;. • interest;. • acquisitions;. • construction and other project commitments;. • other equity commitments, including business development investments;. • equity repurchases and/or cash dividends on our common stock;. • taxes; and. • Parent Company overhead costs.. The AES Corporation's principal sources of liquidity are:. • dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries;. • proceeds from debt and equity financings at the Parent Company level; and. • proceeds from asset sales.. For a more detailed discussion of The AES Corporation's cash requirements and sources of liquidity, please see Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity in this Form 10-K.. While we believe that these sources will be adequate to meet our obligations at the Parent Company level for the foreseeable future, this belief is based on a number of material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital or commercial lending markets, the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, exchange rates, our ability to sell assets, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and other distributions. Any number of assumptions could prove to be incorrect, and, therefore there can be no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than expected. In addition, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay at maturity the entire principal outstanding under our credit facility, term loan, and our debt securities and we may have to refinance such obligations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all and any of these events could have a material effect on us.. Our ability to grow our business could be materially adversely affected if we were unable to raise capital on favorable terms.. From time to time, we rely on access to capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows. Our ability to arrange for financing on either a recourse or non-recourse basis and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:. • general economic and capital market conditions;. • the availability of bank credit;. • the financial condition, performance and prospects of The AES Corporation in general and/or that of any subsidiary requiring the financing as well as companies in our industry or similar financial circumstances; and. • changes in tax and securities laws which are conducive to raising capital.. Should future access to capital not be available to us, we may have to sell assets or decide not to build new plants, or expand or improve existing facilities, either of which would affect our future growth, results of operations or financial condition.. A downgrade in the credit ratings of The AES Corporation or its subsidiaries could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets which could increase our interest costs or adversely affect our liquidity and cash flow.. 48. If any of the credit ratings of The AES Corporation or its subsidiaries were to be downgraded, our ability to raise capital on favorable terms could be impaired and our borrowing costs could increase. Furthermore, depending on The AES Corporation's credit ratings and the trading prices of its equity and debt securities, counterparties may no longer be as willing to accept general unsecured commitments by The AES Corporation to provide credit support. Accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, The AES Corporation may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit and/or collateral, to backstop or replace any credit support by The AES Corporation. There can be no assurance that such counterparties will accept such guarantees or that AES could arrange such further assurances in the future. In addition, to the extent The AES Corporation is required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, it will limit the amount of credit available to The AES Corporation to meet its other liquidity needs.. We may not be able to raise sufficient capital to fund developing projects in certain less developed economies which could change or in some cases adversely affect our growth strategy.. Part of our strategy is to grow our business by developing businesses in less developed economies where the return on our investment may be greater than projects in more developed economies. Commercial lending institutions sometimes refuse to provide non-recourse project financing in certain less developed economies, and in these situations we have sought and will continue to seek direct or indirect (through credit support or guarantees) project financing from a limited number of multilateral or bilateral international financial institutions or agencies. As a precondition to making such project financing available, the lending institutions may also require governmental guarantees for certain project and sovereign related risks. There can be no assurance, however, that project financing from the international financial agencies or that governmental guarantees will be available when needed, and if they are not, we may have to abandon the project or invest more of our own funds which may not be in line with our investment objectives and would leave less funds for other projects.. External Risks Associated with Revenue and Earnings Volatility. Our businesses may incur substantial costs and liabilities and be exposed to price volatility as a result of risks associated with the wholesale electricity markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.. Some of our businesses sell electricity in the spot markets in cases where they operate at levels in excess of their power sales agreements or retail load obligations. Our businesses may also buy electricity in the wholesale spot markets. As a result, we are exposed to the risks of rising and falling prices in those markets. The open market wholesale prices for electricity can be volatile and generally reflect the variable cost of the source generation which could include renewable sources at near zero pricing or thermal sources subject to fluctuating cost of fuels such as coal, natural gas or oil derivative fuels in addition to other factors described below. Consequently, any changes in the generation supply stack and cost of coal, natural gas, or oil derivative fuels may impact the open market wholesale price of electricity.. Volatility in market prices for fuel and electricity may result from, among other things:. • plant availability in the markets generally;. • availability and effectiveness of transmission facilities owned and operated by third parties;. • competition;. • seasonality;. • hydrology and other weather conditions;. • illiquid markets;. • transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies;. • renewables source contribution to the supply stack;. • increased adoption of distributed generation;. • energy efficiency and demand side resources;. • available supplies of natural gas, crude oil and refined products, and coal;. • generating unit performance;. • natural disasters, terrorism, wars, embargoes, and other catastrophic events;. • energy, market and environmental regulation, legislation and policies;. • general economic conditions in areas where we operate which impact energy consumption; and. • bidding behavior and market bidding rules.. 49. Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates experienced at our foreign operations.. Our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity's functional currency. While the Consolidated Financial Statements are reported in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of many of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into U.S. dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies where our subsidiaries outside the U.S. report could cause significant fluctuations in our results. In addition, while our expenses with respect to foreign operations are generally denominated in the same currency as corresponding sales, we have transaction exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiary's functional currency. Moreover, the costs of doing business abroad may increase as a result of adverse exchange rate fluctuations. Our financial position and results of operations could be affected by fluctuations in the value of a number of currencies.. Wholesale Power Prices are declining in many markets and this could have a material adverse effect on our operations and opportunities for future growth.. The wholesale prices offered for electricity have declined significantly in recent years in many markets in which the Company has businesses. This price decline is due to a variety of factors, including the increased penetration of renewable generation resources, cheap natural gas and demand side management. The levelized cost of electricity from new solar and wind generation sources has dropped substantially in recent years as solar panel costs have declined and wind turbine costs have declined, while wind capacity factors have increased. These renewable resources have no fuel costs and very low operational costs. In many instances energy from these facilities are bid into the wholesale spot market at a price of zero or close to zero during certain times of the day, driving down the clearing price for all generators selling power in the relevant spot market. Also, in many markets new power purchase agreements have been awarded for renewable generation at prices significantly lower than the prices being awarded just a few years ago.. This trend of declining wholesale prices could continue and could have a material adverse impact on the financial performance of our existing generation assets to the extent they currently sell power into the spot market or will seek to sell power into the spot market once their power purchase agreements expire. The trend of declining prices can also make it more difficult for us to obtain attractive prices under new long-term power purchase agreements for any new generation facilities we may seek to develop. As a result, the trend can have an adverse impact on our opportunities for new investments.. We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates.. We routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity, fuel requirements and other commodities to lower our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations. As part of this strategy, we routinely utilize fixed price or indexed forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. We also enter into contracts which help us manage our interest rate exposure. However, we may not cover the entire exposure of our assets or positions to market price or interest rate volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. Furthermore, the risk management practices we have in place may not always perform as planned. In particular, if prices of commodities or interest rates significantly deviate from historical prices or interest rates or if the price or interest rate volatility or distribution of these changes deviates from historical norms, our risk management practices may not protect us from significant losses. As a result, fluctuating commodity prices or interest rates may negatively impact our financial results to the extent we have unhedged or inadequately hedged positions. In addition, certain types of economic hedging activities may not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP, resulting in increased volatility in our net income. The Company may also suffer losses associated with \"basis risk\" which is the difference in performance between the hedge instrument and the targeted underlying exposure. Furthermore, there is a risk that the current counterparties to these arrangements may fail or are unable to perform part or all of their obligations under these arrangements.. For our businesses with PPA pricing that does not perfectly pass through our fuel costs, the businesses attempt to manage the exposure through flexible fuel purchasing and timing of entry and terms of our fuel supply agreements; however, these risk management efforts may not be successful and the resulting commodity exposure could have a material impact on these businesses and/or our results of operations.. 50. Supplier and/or customer concentration may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks.. We often rely on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel and other services required for the operation of some of our facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform, we would seek to meet our fuel requirements by purchasing fuel at market prices, exposing us to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price, which could adversely impact the profitability of the affected business and our results of operations, and could result in a breach of agreements with other counterparties, including, without limitation, offtakers or lenders.. At times, we rely on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility's output, in some cases under long-term agreements that account for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a given facility. Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable to perform their obligations. We may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements, or at all. If we were unable to enter into replacement PPAs, these businesses may have to sell power at market prices. A breach by a counterparty of a PPA or other agreement could also result in the breach of other agreements, including, without limitation, the debt documents of the affected business.. The failure of any supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations to The AES Corporation or our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Consequently, the financial performance of our facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers and customers.. The market pricing of our common stock may be volatile in future periods.. The market price for our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future. Stock price movements on a quarter-by-quarter basis for the past two years are presented in Item 5. - Market For Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Market Information of this Form 10-K. Factors that could affect the price of our common stock in the future include general conditions in our industry, in the power markets in which we participate and in the world, including environmental and economic developments, over which we have no control, as well as developments specific to us, including risks that could result in revenue and earnings volatility as well as other risk factors described in Item 1A. - Risk Factors and those matters described in Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.. Risks Associated with our Operations. We do a significant amount of business outside the U.S., including in developing countries, which presents significant risks.. A significant amount of our revenue is generated outside the U.S. and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted in developing countries. Part of our growth strategy is to expand our business in certain developing countries in which AES has an existing presence as such countries may have higher growth rates and offer greater opportunities to expand from our platforms, with potentially higher returns than in some more developed countries. International operations, particularly the operation, financing and development of projects in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:. • economic, social and political instability in any particular country or region;. • adverse changes in currency exchange rates;. • government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;. • unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations or in trade, monetary or fiscal policies;. • high inflation and monetary fluctuations;. • restrictions on imports of coal, oil, gas or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate;. • threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;. • risks relating to the failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, United Kingdom Bribery Act or other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations;. • difficulties in hiring, training and retaining qualified personnel, particularly finance and accounting personnel with GAAP expertise;. • unwillingness of governments and their agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor their contracts;. • unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous to subsidiaries of the Company and economically unfavorable to. 51. counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties are governments or private parties;. • inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems;. • adverse changes in government tax policy;. • difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights or enforcing judgments or obtaining a favorable result in local jurisdictions; and. • potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions.. Any of these factors, by itself or in combination with others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our operations may experience volatility in revenues and operating margin which have caused and are expected to cause significant volatility in our results of operations and cash flows. The volatility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political instability and currency devaluations being experienced in many of these countries. This volatility reduces the predictability and enhances the uncertainty associated with cash flows from these businesses. A number of our businesses are facing challenges associated with regulatory changes.. The operation of power generation, distribution and transmission facilities involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial results. We and/or our subsidiaries may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage for liabilities.. We are in the business of generating and distributing electricity, which involves certain risks that can adversely affect financial and operating performance, including:. • changes in the availability of our generation facilities or distribution systems due to increases in scheduled and unscheduled plant outages, equipment failure, failure of transmission systems, labor disputes, disruptions in fuel supply, poor hydrologic and wind conditions, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements or catastrophic events such as fires, floods, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, dam failures, explosions, terrorist acts, cyber attacks or other similar occurrences; and. • changes in our operating cost structure, including, but not limited to, increases in costs relating to gas, coal, oil and other fuel; fuel transportation; purchased electricity; operations, maintenance and repair; environmental compliance, including the cost of purchasing emissions offsets and capital expenditures to install environmental emission equipment; transmission access; and insurance.. Our businesses require reliable transportation sources (including related infrastructure such as roads, ports and rail), power sources and water sources to access and conduct operations. The availability and cost of this infrastructure affects capital and operating costs and levels of production and sales. Limitations, or interruptions in this infrastructure or at the facilities of our subsidiaries, including as a result of third parties intentionally or unintentionally disrupting this infrastructure or the facilities of our subsidiaries, could impede their ability to produce electricity. This could have a material adverse effect on our businesses' results of operations, financial condition and prospects.. In addition, a portion of our generation facilities were constructed many years ago. Older generating equipment may require significant capital expenditures for maintenance. The equipment at our plants, whether old or new, is also likely to require periodic upgrading, improvement or repair, and replacement equipment or parts may be difficult to obtain in circumstances where we rely on a single supplier or a small number of suppliers. The inability to obtain replacement equipment or parts may impact the ability of our plants to perform and could, therefore, have a material impact on our business and results of operations. Breakdown or failure of one of our operating facilities may prevent the facility from performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in certain situations, could result in termination of a power purchase or other agreement or incurrence of a liability for liquidated damages and/or other penalties.. As a result of the above risks and other potential hazards associated with the power generation, distribution and transmission industries, we may from time to time become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage. Power generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks, such as earthquakes, floods, lightning, hurricanes and wind, hazards, such as fire, explosion, collapse and machinery failure, are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as a result of inadequate internal processes, technological flaws, human error or actions of third parties or other external events. The control and management of these risks depend upon adequate development and training of personnel and on the existence of operational procedures, preventative maintenance. 52. plans and specific programs supported by quality control systems which reduce, but do not eliminate, the possibility of the occurrence and impact of these risks.. The hazards described above, along with other safety hazards associated with our operations, can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and fines and/or penalties. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is customary, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. A claim for which we are not fully insured or insured at all could hurt our financial results and materially harm our financial condition. Further, due to the cyclical nature of the insurance markets, we cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available on terms similar to those presently available to us or at all. Any losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.. Our businesses' insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with its operations. Adequate coverage at reasonable rates is not always obtainable. In addition, insurance may not fully cover the liability or the consequences of any business interruptions such as equipment failure or labor dispute. The occurrence of a significant adverse event not fully or partially covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results or operations, financial condition and prospects.. Any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. We may not be able to attract and retain skilled people, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.. Our operating success and ability to carry out growth initiatives depends in part on our ability to retain executives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel who have experience in our industry and in operating a company of our size and complexity, including people in our foreign businesses. The inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, because of the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements. For example, we routinely are required to assess the financial impacts of complicated business transactions which occur on a worldwide basis. These assessments are dependent on hiring personnel on a worldwide basis with sufficient expertise in U.S. GAAP to timely and accurately comply with U.S. reporting obligations. An inability to maintain adequate internal accounting and managerial controls and hire and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our financial and tax reporting.. We have contractual obligations to certain customers to provide full requirements service, which makes it difficult to predict and plan for load requirements and may result in increased operating costs to certain of our businesses.. We have contractual obligations to certain customers to supply power to satisfy all or a portion of their energy requirements. The uncertainty regarding the amount of power that our power generation and distribution facilities must be prepared to supply to customers may increase our operating costs. A significant under- or over-estimation of load requirements could result in our facilities not having enough or having too much power to cover their obligations, in which case we would be required to buy or sell power from or to third parties at prevailing market prices. Those prices may not be favorable and thus could increase our operating costs.. We may not be able to enter into long-term contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations.. Many of our generation plants conduct business under long-term sales and supply contracts, which helps these businesses to manage risks by reducing the volatility associated with power and input costs and providing a stable revenue and cost structure. In these instances, we rely on power sales contracts with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant plant's output and revenues over the term of the power sales contract. The remaining terms of the power sales contracts of our generation plants range from one to 25 years. In many cases, we also limit our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by entering into long-term contracts for fuel with a limited number of suppliers. In these instances, the cash flows and results of operations are dependent on the continued ability of customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under the relevant power sales contract or fuel supply contract, respectively. Some of our long-term power sales agreements are at prices above current spot market prices and some of our long-term fuel supply contracts are at prices below current market prices. The loss of significant power sales contracts or fuel supply contracts, or the failure by any of the parties to such contracts that prevents us from fulfilling our obligations thereunder, could adversely impact our strategy by resulting in costs that exceed revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on our business,. 53. results of operations and financial condition. In addition, depending on market conditions and regulatory regimes, it may be difficult for us to secure long-term contracts, either where our current contracts are expiring or for new development projects. The inability to enter into long-term contracts could require many of our businesses to purchase inputs at market prices and sell electricity into spot markets, which may not be favorable.. We have sought to reduce counterparty credit risk under our long-term contracts in part by entering into power sales contracts with utilities or other customers of strong credit quality and by obtaining guarantees from certain sovereign governments of the customer's obligations. However, many of our customers do not have, or have failed to maintain, an investment-grade credit rating, and our generation business cannot always obtain government guarantees and if they do, the government does not always have an investment grade credit rating. We have also sought to reduce our credit risk by locating our plants in different geographic areas in order to mitigate the effects of regional economic downturns. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts to mitigate this risk will be successful.. Competition is increasing and could adversely affect us.. The power production markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom may have extensive and diversified developmental or operating experience (including both domestic and international) and financial resources similar to or greater than ours. Further, in recent years, the power production industry has been characterized by strong and increasing competition with respect to both obtaining power sales agreements and acquiring existing power generation assets. In certain markets, these factors have caused reductions in prices contained in new power sales agreements and, in many cases, have caused higher acquisition prices for existing assets through competitive bidding practices. The evolution of competitive electricity markets and the development of highly efficient gas-fired power plants and renewables such as wind and solar have also caused, or are anticipated to cause, price pressure in certain power markets where we sell or intend to sell power. These competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on us.. Some of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension plan obligations may require additional significant contributions.. Certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their respective employees. Of the thirty one such defined benefit plans, five are at U.S. subsidiaries and the remaining plans are at foreign subsidiaries. Pension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be wrong, resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. The Company periodically evaluates the value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund the respective pension obligations. The Company's exposure to market volatility is mitigated to some extent due to the fact that the asset allocations in our largest plans include a significant weighting of investments in fixed income securities that are less volatile than investments in equity securities. Future downturns in the debt and/or equity markets, or the inaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries' pension plan obligations, could result in an increase in pension expense and future funding requirements, which may be material. Our subsidiaries who participate in these plans are responsible for satisfying the funding requirements required by law in their respective jurisdiction for any shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. This may necessitate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely affect the Parent Company and our subsidiaries' liquidity.. For additional information regarding the funding position of the Company's pension plans, see Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Pension and Other Postretirement Plans and Note 13. - Benefit Plans included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in this Form 10-K.. Our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties.. Certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates are in various stages of developing and constructing power plants, some but not all of which have signed long-term contracts or made similar arrangements for the sale of electricity. Successful completion depends upon overcoming substantial risks, including, but not limited to, risks relating to siting, financing, engineering and construction, permitting, governmental approvals, commissioning delays, or the potential for termination of the power sales contract as a result of a failure to meet certain milestones. For additional information regarding our projects under construction see Item 1. - Business - Our Organization and Segments included in this Form 10-K.. In certain cases, our subsidiaries may enter into obligations in the development process even though the subsidiaries have not yet secured financing, power purchase arrangements, or other aspects of the development. 54. process. For example, in certain cases, our subsidiaries may instruct contractors to begin the construction process or seek to procure equipment even where they do not have financing or a power purchase agreement in place (or conversely, to enter into a power purchase, procurement or other agreement without financing in place). If the project does not proceed, our subsidiaries may remain obligated for certain liabilities even though the project will not proceed. Development is inherently uncertain and we may forgo certain development opportunities and we may undertake significant development costs before determining that we will not proceed with a particular project. We believe that capitalized costs for projects under development are recoverable; however, there can be no assurance that any individual project will be completed and reach commercial operation. If these development efforts are not successful, we may abandon a project under development and write off the costs incurred in connection with such project. At the time of abandonment, we would expense all capitalized development costs incurred in connection therewith and could incur additional losses associated with any related contingent liabilities.. In some of our joint venture projects and businesses, we have granted protective rights to minority shareholders or we own less than a majority of the equity in the project or business and do not manage or otherwise control the project or business, which entails certain risks.. We have invested in some joint ventures where our subsidiaries share operational, management, investment and/or other control rights with our joint venture partners. In many cases, we may exert influence over the joint venture pursuant to a management contract, by holding positions on the board of the joint venture company or on management committees and/or through certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, we do not always have this type of influence over the project or business in every instance and we may be dependent on our joint venture partners or the management team of the joint venture to operate, manage, invest or otherwise control such projects or businesses. Our joint venture partners or the management team of our joint ventures may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally, and they may not share our business priorities. In some joint venture agreements where we do have majority control of the voting securities, we have entered into shareholder agreements granting protective minority rights to the other shareholders.. The approval of joint venture partners also may be required for us to receive distributions of funds from jointly owned entities or to transfer our interest in projects or businesses. The control or influence exerted by our joint venture partners may result in operational management and/or investment decisions which are different from the decisions our subsidiaries would make if they operated independently and could impact the profitability and value of these joint ventures. In addition, in the event that a joint venture partner becomes insolvent or bankrupt or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations to the joint venture or its share of liabilities at the joint venture, we may be subject to joint and several liability for these joint ventures, if and to the extent provided for in our governing documents or applicable law.. Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties, including development, operational, and regulatory challenges.. Wind, solar, and energy storage projects are subject to substantial risks. Projects of this nature have been developed through advancement in technologies which may not be proven or whose commercial application is limited, and which are unrelated to our core business. Some of these business lines are dependent upon favorable regulatory incentives to support continued investment, and there is significant uncertainty about the extent to which such favorable regulatory incentives will be available in the future.. Furthermore, production levels for our wind and solar projects may be dependent upon adequate wind or sunlight resulting in volatility in production levels and profitability. For example, for our wind projects, wind resource estimates are based on historical experience when available and on wind resource studies conducted by an independent engineer, and are not expected to reflect actual wind energy production in any given year.. As a result, these types of renewable energy projects face considerable risk relative to our core business, including the risk that favorable regulatory regimes expire or are adversely modified. In addition, because certain of these projects depend on technology outside of our expertise in generation and utility businesses, there are risks associated with our ability to develop and manage such projects profitably. Furthermore, at the development or acquisition stage, because of the nascent nature of these industries or the limited experience with the relevant technologies, our ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered and the projects may not perform as predicted. There are also risks associated with the fact that some of these projects exist in markets where long-term fixed price contracts for the major cost and revenue components may be unavailable, which in turn may result in these projects having relatively high levels of volatility. Even where available, many of our renewable projects sell power under a Feed-in-Tariff, which may be eliminated or reduced, which can impact the profitability of these projects, or make money through the sale of Emission Reductions products, such as Certified Emissions. 55. Reductions, Renewable Energy Certificates or Renewable Obligation Certificates, and the price of these products may be volatile. These projects can be capital-intensive and generally are designed with a view to obtaining third party financing, which may be difficult to obtain. As a result, these capital constraints may reduce our ability to develop these projects or obtain third party financing for these projects.. Impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $1.1 billion of goodwill, which represented approximately 3.2% of the total assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We may be required to evaluate the potential impairment of goodwill outside of the required annual evaluation process if we experience situations, including but not limited to: deterioration in general economic conditions, or our operating or regulatory environment; increased competitive environment; increase in fuel costs, particularly when we are unable to pass through the impact to customers; negative or declining cash flows; loss of a key contract or customer, particularly when we are unable to replace it on equally favorable terms; divestiture of a significant component of our business; or adverse actions or assessments by a regulator. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment, which could substantially affect our results of operations for those periods. Additionally, goodwill may be impaired if our acquisitions do not perform as expected. See the risk factor Our acquisitions may not perform as expected for further discussion.. Long-lived assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment only when impairment indicators, similar to those described above for goodwill, are present, whereas goodwill is also evaluated for impairment on an annual basis.. Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather.. Our businesses are affected by variations in general weather patterns and unusually severe weather. Our businesses forecast electric sales on the basis of normal weather, which represents a long-term historical average. While we also consider possible variations in normal weather patterns and potential impacts on our facilities and our businesses, there can be no assurance that such planning can prevent these impacts, which can adversely affect our business. Generally, demand for electricity peaks in winter and summer. Typically, when winters are warmer than expected and summers are cooler than expected, demand for energy is lower, resulting in less demand for electricity than forecasted. Significant variations from normal weather where our businesses are located could have a material impact on our results of operations.. In addition, we are dependent upon hydrological conditions prevailing from time to time in the broad geographic regions in which our hydroelectric generation facilities are located. If hydrological conditions result in droughts or other conditions that negatively affect our hydroelectric generation business, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.. Cyber-attacks and data security breaches could adversely harm our business.. Our business is heavily reliant on electronic systems and network technologies to operate our generation and transmission infrastructure. We also use various financial, accounting and other infrastructure systems. Our infrastructure may be targeted by nation states, hacktivists, criminals, insiders or terrorist groups. Such an attack may result in interruption of operations, property damage, our ability to control our infrastructure assets, release of sensitive customer information and limited communications with third parties. Any loss or corruption of confidential or proprietary data through such breach may:. • impair our reputation;. • impact our operations and strategic objectives;. • expose us to legal claims;. • result in substantial revenue loss; and. • require extensive repair and restoration costs for additional security measures to avert future cyber-attacks.. In addition, a breach of our financial and accounting systems could impact our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information.. We have implemented measures to help prevent unauthorized access to our systems and facilities, including some measures to comply with mandatory regulatory reliability standards, and we also maintain insurance coverage to mitigate some of these risks. To date, we have not seen material impact on our business or operations due to a cyber-attack; however we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent future cyber-attacks. 56. and security breaches. We continue to assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and make investments to address them, including global monitoring of networks and systems, identifying and implementing new technology, improving user awareness through employee security training, and updating security policies for the Company and its third-party providers.. Our acquisitions may not perform as expected.. Historically, acquisitions have been a significant part of our growth strategy. We may continue to grow our business through acquisitions. Although acquired businesses may have significant operating histories, we will have a limited or no history of owning and operating many of these businesses and possibly limited or no experience operating in the country or region where these businesses are located. Some of these businesses may have been government owned and some may be operated as part of a larger integrated utility prior to their acquisition. If we were to acquire any of these types of businesses, there can be no assurance that:. • we will be successful in transitioning them to private ownership;. • such businesses will perform as expected;. • integration or other one-time costs will not be greater than expected;. • we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities;. • such businesses will generate sufficient cash flow to support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them; or. • the rate of return from such businesses will justify our decision to invest capital to acquire them.. Risks associated with Governmental Regulation and Laws. Our operations are subject to significant government regulation and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes.. Our ability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any ability to obtain expected or contracted increases in electricity tariff or contract rates or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations or our ability to meet publicly announced projections or analysts' expectations. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly at our utilities where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to:. • changes in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass-through costs to be included in the rates we charge our customers, including but not limited to costs incurred to upgrade our power plants to comply with more stringent environmental regulations;. • changes in the determination of what is an appropriate rate of return on invested capital or a determination that a utility's operating income or the rates it charges customers are too high, resulting in a reduction of rates or consumer rebates;. • changes in the definition or determination of controllable or non-controllable costs;. • adverse changes in tax law;. • changes in law or regulation which limit or otherwise affect the ability of our counterparties (including sovereign or private parties) to fulfill their obligations (including payment obligations) to us or our subsidiaries;. • changes in environmental law which impose additional costs or limit the dispatch of our generating facilities within our subsidiaries;. • changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium;. • changes in the timing of tariff increases;. • other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions;. • other changes related to licensing or permitting which affect our ability to conduct business; or. • other changes that impact the short- or long-term price-setting mechanism in the markets where we operate.. Any of the above events may result in lower margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect our business.. In many countries where we conduct business, the regulatory environment is constantly changing and it may be difficult to predict the impact of the regulations on our businesses. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed. 57. the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act substantially expands the regulation regarding the trading, clearing and reporting of derivative transactions, and the Dodd-Frank Act provides for commercial end-user exemptions which may apply to our derivative transactions. However, even with the exemption, the Dodd-Frank Act could still have a material adverse impact on the Company, as the regulation of derivatives (which includes capital and margin requirements for non-exempt companies), could limit the availability of derivative transactions that we use to reduce interest rate, commodity and currency risks, which would increase our exposure to these risks. The impacts described above could also result from our (or our subsidiaries') efforts to comply with European Market Infrastructure Regulation, which includes regulations related to the trading, reporting and clearing of derivatives. It is also possible that additional similar regulations may be passed in other jurisdictions where we conduct business. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the Company.. Our business in the United States is subject to the provisions of various laws and regulations administered in whole or in part by the FERC and NERC, including PURPA, the Federal Power Act, and the EPAct 2005. Actions by the FERC, NERC and by state utility commissions can have a material effect on our operations.. Several of our generation businesses in the U.S. currently operate QFs as defined under PURPA. These businesses entered into long-term contracts with electric utilities that had a mandatory obligation under PURPA to purchase power from QFs at the utility's avoided cost (i.e., the costs for both energy and capital investment that would have been incurred by the purchasing utility if that utility had to provide its own generating capacity or purchase it from another source). EPAct 2005 authorizes the FERC to eliminate the obligation of electric utilities under Section 210 of PURPA to enter into new contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity from or to QFs if certain market conditions are met. Pursuant to this authority, the FERC has instituted a rebuttable presumption that utilities located within the control areas of MISO, PJM , ISO New England, Inc., the New York Independent System Operator, Inc., and ERCOT are not required to purchase or sell power from or to QFs above a certain size. In addition, the FERC is authorized under EPAct 2005 to remove the purchase/sale obligations of individual utilities on a case-by-case basis. While this law does not affect existing contracts, as a result of the changes to PURPA, our QFs may face a more difficult market environment when their current long-term contracts expire.. EPAct 2005 repealed PUHCA 1935 and enacted PUHCA 2005 in its place. PUHCA 1935 had the effect of requiring utility holding companies to operate in geographically proximate regions and therefore limited the range of potential combinations and mergers among utilities. By comparison, PUHCA 2005 has no such restrictions and simply provides the FERC and state utility commissions with enhanced access to the books and records of certain utility holding companies. The repeal of PUHCA 1935 removed barriers to mergers and other potential combinations which could result in the creation of large, geographically dispersed utility holding companies. These entities may have enhanced financial strength and therefore an increased ability to compete with us in the U.S. generation market.. In accordance with Congressional mandates in the EPAct 1992 and now in EPAct 2005, the FERC has strongly encouraged competition in wholesale electric markets. Increased competition may have the effect of lowering our operating margins. Among other steps, the FERC has encouraged RTOs and ISOs to develop demand response bidding programs as a mechanism for responding to peak electric demand. These programs may reduce the value of our peaking assets which rely on very high prices during a relatively small number of hours to recover their costs. Similarly, the FERC is encouraging the construction of new transmission infrastructure in accordance with provisions of EPAct 2005. Although new transmission lines may increase market opportunities, they may also increase the competition in our existing markets.. While the FERC continues to promote competition, some state utility commissions have reversed course and begun to encourage the construction of generation facilities by traditional utilities to be paid for on a cost-of-service basis by retail ratepayers. Such actions have the effect of reducing sale opportunities in the competitive wholesale generating markets in which we operate.. FERC has civil penalty authority over violations of any provision of Part II of the FPA which concerns wholesale generation or transmission, as well as any rule or order issued thereunder. The FPA also provides for the assessment of criminal fines and imprisonment for violations under the FPA. This penalty authority was enhanced in EPAct 2005. As a result, FERC is authorized to assess a maximum penalty authority established by statute has been and will continue to be adjusted periodically to account for inflation. With this expanded enforcement authority, violations of the FPA and FERC's regulations could potentially have more serious consequences than in the past.. Pursuant to EPAct 2005, the NERC has been certified by FERC as the Electric Reliability Organization (\"ERO\") to develop mandatory and enforceable electric system reliability standards applicable throughout the U.S. to improve the overall reliability of the electric grid. These standards are subject to FERC review and approval.. 58. Once approved, the reliability standards may be enforced by FERC independently, or, alternatively, by the ERO and regional reliability organizations with responsibility for auditing, investigating and otherwise ensuring compliance with reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight. Violations of NERC reliability standards are subject to FERC's penalty authority under the FPA and EPAct 2005.. Our utility businesses in the U.S. face significant regulation by their respective state utility commissions. The regulatory discretion is reasonably broad in both Indiana and Ohio and includes regulation as to services and facilities, the valuation of property, the construction, purchase, or lease of electric generating facilities, the classification of accounts, rates of depreciation, the increase or decrease in retail rates and charges, the issuance of certain securities, the acquisition and sale of some public utility properties or securities and certain other matters. These businesses face the risk of unexpected or adverse regulatory action which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. See Item 1. - Business - US SBU - U.S. Businesses - U.S. Utilities for further information on the regulation faced by our U.S. utilities.. Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations.. Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations by many federal, regional, state and local authorities, international treaties and foreign governmental authorities. These laws and regulations generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use of water, wetlands preservation, remediation of contamination, waste disposal, endangered species and noise regulation, among others. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain or comply with any necessary environmental permits pursuant to such laws and regulations could result in fines or other sanctions. Environmental laws and regulations affecting power generation and distribution are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Congress and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities have either considered or implemented various laws and regulations to restrict or tax certain emissions, particularly those involving air emissions and water discharges. See the various descriptions of these laws and regulations contained in Item 1. - Business of this Form 10-K. These laws and regulations have imposed, and proposed laws and regulations could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our power plants. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these and other environmental laws and regulations. Changes in, or new development of, environmental restrictions may force the Company to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceed our estimates. There can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that our business, financial condition, including recorded asset values or results of operations, would not be materially and adversely affected by such expenditures or any changes in domestic or foreign environmental laws and regulations.. Our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies.. The EPA has pursued an enforcement initiative against coal-fired generating plants alleging wide-spread violations of the new source review and prevention of significant deterioration provisions of the CAA. The EPA has brought suit against a number of companies and has obtained settlements with many of these companies over such allegations. The allegations typically involve claims that a company made major modifications to a coal-fired generating unit without proper permit approval and without installing best available control technology. The principal, but not exclusive, focus of this EPA enforcement initiative is emissions of SO2 and NOx. In connection with this enforcement initiative, the EPA has imposed fines and required companies to install improved pollution control technologies to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx. In addition to EPA enforcement, state regulatory agencies and non-governmental environmental organizations have pursued civil lawsuits against power plants in situations where the EPA has not taken such action. These civil suits have resulted in judgments and/or settlements that require the installation of expensive pollution controls or the accelerated retirement of certain electric generating units. There can be no assurance that foreign environmental regulatory agencies or environmental organizations in countries in which our subsidiaries operate will not pursue similar enforcement initiatives under relevant laws and regulations.. Regulators, politicians, non-governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. As discussed in Item 1. - Business, at the international, federal and various regional and state levels, rules are in effect and policies are under development to regulate GHG emissions, thereby effectively imposing a cost on such emissions in order to create financial incentives to reduce them. In 2017, the Company's subsidiaries operated businesses which had total CO2 emissions of approximately 62.88 million metric tonnes, approximately 28.7 million of which were emitted by businesses located in the U.S. (both figures are ownership adjusted). The Company uses CO2 emission estimation methodologies supported by \"The Greenhouse Gas Protocol\" reporting standard on GHG. 59. emissions. For existing power generation plants, CO2 emissions data are either obtained directly from plant continuous emission monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type CO2 emission factors. The estimated annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric power generation facilities of the Company's subsidiaries that are in construction or development and have received the necessary air permits for commercial operations are approximately 10.3 million metric tonnes (ownership adjusted). This overall estimate is based on a number of projections and assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, such as the forecasted dispatch, anticipated plant efficiency, fuel type, CO2 emissions rates and our subsidiaries' achieving completion of such construction and development projects. However, it is certain that the projects under construction or development when completed will increase emissions of our portfolio and therefore could increase the risks associated with regulation of GHG emissions. Because there is significant uncertainty regarding these estimates, actual emissions from these projects under construction or development may vary substantially from these estimates.. The non-utility, generation subsidiaries of the Company often seek to pass on any costs arising from CO2 emissions to contract counterparties, but there can be no assurance that such subsidiaries of the Company will effectively pass such costs onto the contract counterparties or that the cost and burden associated with any dispute over which party bears such costs would not be burdensome and costly to the relevant subsidiaries of the Company. The utility subsidiaries of the Company may seek to pass on any costs arising from CO2 emissions to customers, but there can be no assurance that such subsidiaries of the Company will effectively pass such costs to the customers, or that they will be able to fully or timely recover such costs.. Foreign, federal, state or regional regulation of GHG emissions could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial performance. The actual impact on the Company's financial performance and the financial performance of the Company's subsidiaries will depend on a number of factors, including among others, the degree and timing of GHG emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulation, the cost of emissions reduction equipment and the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which market based compliance options are available, the extent to which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such legislation or regulation on the ability of our subsidiaries to recover costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise. As a result of these factors, our cost of compliance could be substantial and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.. In January 2005, based on European Community \"Directive 2003/87/EC on Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowance Trading,\" the EU ETS commenced operation as the largest multi-country GHG emission trading scheme in the world. On February 16, 2005, the Kyoto Protocol became effective. The Kyoto Protocol requires all developed countries that have ratified it to substantially reduce their GHG emissions, including CO2. However, the United States never ratified the Kyoto Protocol and, to date, compliance with the Kyoto Protocol and the EU ETS has not had a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. In December 2015, the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (\"UNFCCC\") convened for the 21st Conference of the Parties in Paris, France. The result was the so-called Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement has a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. In furtherance of this goal, participating countries submitted comprehensive national climate action plans and have agreed to meet every five years to set more ambitious targets as required by science, to report to each other and the public on how well they are doing to implement their targets and to track progress towards the long-term goal through a robust transparency and accountability system. We anticipate that the Paris Agreement will continue the trend toward efforts to de-carbonize the global economy and to further limit GHG emissions, including in those countries where the Company does business. It is difficult to predict the nature, timing and scope of such regulation but it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance.. In the U.S., there currently is no federal legislation imposing mandatory GHG emission reductions (including for CO2) affecting the electric power generation facilities of the Company's subsidiaries. However, in 2011, the EPA adopted regulations pertaining to GHG emissions that require new and existing sources of GHG emissions to potentially obtain new source review permits from the EPA prior to construction or modification, but only if they also must obtain a new source review permit for increases in other regulated pollutants. Additionally, in 2015, the EPA promulgated a rule establishing New Source Performance Standards for CO2 emissions for newly constructed and modified/reconstructed fossil-fueled EUSGUs larger than 25 MW. Also in 2015, the EPA promulgated the CPP, which is applicable to preexisting EUSGUs, and requires interim reductions beginning in 2022, with full compliance achieved by 2030. Under the CPP, states are required to develop and submit plans that establish performance standards or, through emissions trading programs, otherwise meet a state-wide emissions rate average or mass-based goal. These actions have been challenged in Court and the current Administration has announced plans to significantly amend or rescind the rules. For further discussion of the regulation of GHG emissions, including the. 60. U.S. Supreme Court's issued order staying implementation of the CPP, and the EPA's proposal to rescind the CPP, see Item 1. - Business - Environmental and Land-Use Regulations - United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations - Greenhouse Gas Emissions above.. Such regulations, and in particular regulations applying to modified or existing EUSGUs, could increase our costs directly and indirectly and have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations. See Item 1. - Business of this Form 10-K for further discussion about these environmental agreements, laws and regulations.. At the state level, the RGGI, a cap-and-trade program covering CO2 emissions from electric power generation facilities in the Northeast, became effective in January 2009, and California has adopted comprehensive legislation and regulation that requires GHG reductions from multiple industrial sectors, including the electric power generation industry. At this time, other than with regard to RGGI (further described below) and proposed Hawaii regulations relating to the collection of fees on GHG emissions, the impact of both of which we do not expect to be material, the Company cannot estimate the costs of compliance with U.S. federal, regional or state GHG emissions reduction legislation or initiatives, due to the fact that most of these proposals are not being actively pursued or are in the early stages of development and any final regulations or laws, if adopted, could vary drastically from current proposals; in the case of California, we anticipate no material impact due to the fact that we expect such costs will be passed through to our offtakers under the terms of existing tolling agreements.. The auctions of RGGI allowances needed by power generators to comply with state programs implementing RGGI occur approximately every quarter. Our subsidiary in Maryland is our only subsidiary that was subject to RGGI in 2017. Of the approximately 28.7 million metric tonnes of CO2 emitted in the United States by our subsidiaries in 2017 (ownership adjusted), approximately 1.2 million metric tonnes were emitted by our subsidiary in Maryland. The Company estimates that the RGGI compliance costs could be approximately $3.5 million for 2018. There is a risk that our actual compliance costs under RGGI will differ from our estimates by a material amount and that our model could underestimate our costs of compliance.. In addition to government regulators, other groups such as politicians, environmentalists and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about GHG emissions. For example, certain financial institutions have expressed concern about providing financing for facilities which would emit GHGs, which can affect our ability to obtain capital, or if we can obtain capital, to receive it on commercially viable terms. Further, rating agencies may decide to downgrade our credit ratings based on the emissions of the businesses operated by our subsidiaries or increased compliance costs which could make financing unattractive. In addition, plaintiffs have brought tort lawsuits against the Company because of its subsidiaries' GHG emissions. While the litigation mentioned has been dismissed, it is impossible to predict whether similar future lawsuits are likely to prevail or result in damages awards or other relief. Consequently, it is impossible to determine whether such lawsuits are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations and financial condition.. Furthermore, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, physical risks from climate change could include, but are not limited to, increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier and snow-fed rivers, warming of lakes and rivers, an increase in sea level, changes and variability in precipitation and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Physical impacts may have the potential to significantly affect the Company's business and operations, and any such potential impact may render it more difficult for our businesses to obtain financing. For example, extreme weather events could result in increased downtime and operation and maintenance costs at the electric power generation facilities and support facilities of the Company's subsidiaries. Variations in weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity also would be expected to affect the energy needs of customers. A decrease in energy consumption could decrease the revenues of the Company's subsidiaries. In addition, while revenues would be expected to increase if the energy consumption of customers increased, such increase could prompt the need for additional investment in generation capacity. Changes in the temperature of lakes and rivers and changes in precipitation that result in drought could adversely affect the operations of the fossil fuel-fired electric power generation facilities of the Company's subsidiaries. Changes in temperature, precipitation and snow pack conditions also could affect the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation.. In addition to potential physical risks noted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there could be damage to the reputation of the Company due to public perception of GHG emissions by the Company's subsidiaries, and any such negative public perception or concerns could ultimately result in a decreased demand for electric power generation or distribution from our subsidiaries. The level of GHGs emitted by subsidiaries of the Company is not a factor in the compensation of executives of the Company.. 61. If any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on the electric power generation businesses of the Company's subsidiaries and on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.. Our subsidiaries have operations in the U.S. and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. As such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments and of many non-U.S. jurisdictions. From time to time, legislative measures may be enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax positions regarding income or other taxes. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these legislative measures.. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"2017 Act\") enacted December 22, 2017 introduced significant changes to current U.S. federal tax law, including but not limited to lowering the corporate income tax rate, introducing new limits on interest expense deductibility, and changing the way in which foreign earnings are taxed. These changes are complex and are subject to additional guidance to be issued by the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, the reaction to the federal tax changes by the individual states is evolving. Our interpretations and assumptions around U.S. tax reform may evolve in future periods as further administrative guidance and regulations are issued, which may materially affect our effective tax rate or tax payments. For further details, please see Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Key Trends and Uncertainties in this Form 10-K.. Additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine how and where cross-border international trade is subjected to tax are evolving. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\"OECD\"), in coordination with the G8 and G20, through its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project (\"BEPS\") introduced a series of recommendations that many tax jurisdictions have adopted, or may adopt in the future, as law. As these and other tax laws, related regulations and double-tax conventions change, our financial results could be materially impacted. Given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our results of operations.. U.S. federal, state and local, as well as non-U.S., tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will be sustained if challenged by relevant tax authorities and if not sustained, there could be a material impact on our results of operations.. We and our affiliates are subject to material litigation and regulatory proceedings.. We and our affiliates are parties to material litigation and regulatory proceedings. See Item 3. - Legal Proceedings below. There can be no assurances that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position."
