[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are those which we believe are the material risks that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. Any risk described below may have a material adverse impact on Limbach's business or financial condition. Some statements in this annual report on Form 10-K, including such statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on Limbach management's current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.. 8. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry. Our contract backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and could be an uncertain indicator of our future earnings.. We cannot guarantee that the revenues projected in our contract backlog will be realized or, if realized, will be profitable. Projects reflected in the contract backlog may be affected by project cancellations, scope adjustments, time extensions or other changes. Such changes may materially and adversely affect the revenue and profit we ultimately realize on these projects.. Because we bear the risk of cost overruns in most of our contracts, we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses if costs increase above estimates.. Our contract prices are established largely upon estimates and assumptions of our projected costs, including assumptions about: future economic conditions; prices, including commodities prices; availability of labor, including the costs of providing labor, equipment, and materials; and other factors outside our control. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be inaccurate, if circumstances change in a way that renders assumptions and estimates inaccurate or we fail to successfully execute the work, cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or a loss for affected projects. For instance, unanticipated technical problems may arise; we could have difficulty obtaining permits or approvals; local laws, labor costs or labor conditions could change; bad weather could delay construction; raw materials prices could increase; suppliers or subcontractors may fail to perform as expected; or site conditions may be different than expected. We are also exposed to increases in energy prices. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we guarantee project completion or the achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels by a scheduled date. This includes our performance contracting services tied to energy savings on retrofitted energy conservation projects. Failure to meet schedule or performance requirements typically results in additional costs to us, and in some cases may also create liability for consequential and liquidated damages. Performance problems for existing and future projects could cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated and could damage our reputation within the industry and our customer base.. The costs incurred and gross profit realized on our contracts can vary, sometimes substantially, from the original projections due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:. •on-site conditions that differ                                          from those in the original bid or contract;. •failure to include required                                          materials or work in a bid, or the failure to estimate properly the quantities or costs                                          needed to complete a lump sum or guaranteed maximum price contract;. •contract or project modifications                                          creating unanticipated costs not covered by change orders;. •failure by the customer, owner                                          or general contractor to properly approve and authorize change orders for work that is                                          required and as a result, the inability to bill and collect for the value of the work                                          performed;. •failure by suppliers, vendors,                                          subcontractors, designers, engineers, consultants, joint venture partners or customers                                          to perform their obligations;. •delays in quickly identifying                                          and taking measures to address issues which arise during contract execution;. •changes in availability, proximity                                          and costs of materials, including pipe, sheet metal, and other construction materials;. •claims or demands from third                                          parties for alleged damages arising from the design, construction or use and operation                                          of a project of which our work is part;. •difficulties in obtaining required                                          governmental permits or approvals;. 9. •availability and skill level                                          of workers in the geographic location of a project;. •citations issued by any governmental                                          authority, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration;. •unexpected labor conditions,                                          shortages or work stoppages;. •     installation productivity rates different than the rate that was estimated;. •changes in applicable laws                                          and regulations;. •delays caused by weather conditions;. •fraud, theft or other improper                                          activities by suppliers, vendors, subcontractors, designers, engineers, consultants,                                          joint venture partners, customers or our own personnel; and. •mechanical or performance problems                                          with equipment.. Many of our contracts with our customers contain provisions that purport to shift some or all of the above risks from the customer to us, even in cases where the customer is partly at fault. We are not always able to shift this risk to subcontractors. Our experience has often been that customers are willing to negotiate equitable adjustments in the contract compensation or completion time provisions if unexpected circumstances arise. However, customers may seek to impose contractual risk-shifting provisions more aggressively, which could increase risks and adversely affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position.. With our IPD contracts, a portion of our overhead and profit may be at risk.. With IPD projects, the parties to the agreement typically place a portion of their overhead and profit into a profit pool. If savings exist, the profit pool could increase. If there are cost overruns by any party, the profit pool could be reduced or eliminated, leading to the Company having its costs and certain overheads recovered, but it could lead to no gross profit being recognized on an IPD project.. Intense competition in our industry could reduce our market share and profit.. The markets we serve are highly fragmented and competitive. The industry is characterized by numerous companies, many of which are small and whose activities are often geographically concentrated. We compete on the basis of our technical expertise and experience, financial and operational resources, industry reputation and dependability. While we believe our customers consider a number of these factors in awarding available contracts, a large portion of our work is awarded through a bid process. Consequently, price is often the principal factor in determining which contractor is selected, especially on smaller, less complex projects. Smaller competitors are sometimes able to win bids for these projects based on price alone due to their lower cost and financial return requirements. We expect competition in the industry to remain intense for the foreseeable future, presenting us with significant challenges in our ability to maintain strong growth rates and acceptable profit margins. We also expect increased competition from in-house service providers as some of our customers have employees who perform service and maintenance work similar to the services we provide. Vertical consolidation is also expected to intensify competition in the industry. If we are unable to meet these competitive challenges, we will lose market share to our competitors and experience an overall reduction in our profits. In addition, our profitability will be impaired if we have to reduce prices to remain competitive.. Our success depends upon the continuing contributions of certain key personnel, each of whom would be difficult to replace. If we lose the benefit of the experience, efforts and abilities of one or more of these individuals, our operating results could suffer.. Our continuing success depends on the performance of our management team. We cannot guarantee the continued employment of any of our key executives who may choose to leave the company for any number of reasons, such as other business opportunities, differing views on strategic direction or other reasons. We rely on the experience, efforts and abilities of these individuals, each of whom would be difficult to replace.. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified managers, employees, joint venture partners and subcontractors, we will be unable to operate efficiently, which could reduce our profitability.. Our business is labor intensive, and many of our operations experience a high rate of employment turnover. At times of low unemployment rates in the United States, it will be more difficult to find qualified personnel in some geographic areas where we operate. Additionally, our business is managed by a small number of key executive and operational officers. Generally, the industry is facing a shortage of trained, skilled, and qualified management, operational, and field personnel. We may be unable to hire and retain the sufficient skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy or to execute our work in backlog. Changes in general or local economic conditions and the resulting impact on the labor market and on our joint venture partners may make it difficult to attract or retain qualified individuals in the geographic areas where we perform our work. Our labor expenses may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. Labor shortages, increased labor costs or the loss of key personnel could reduce our profitability and negatively impact our business. Further, our relationship with some customers could suffer if we are unable to retain the employees with whom those customers primarily work and have established relationships.. 10. Our business has union and open shop operations, subjecting the business to risk for labor disputes.. We have separate subsidiary employers that have union and non-union operations. There is a risk that our corporate structure and operations in this regard could be challenged by one or more of the unions. An adverse claim or judgment resulting from such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on our operations.. Strikes or work stoppages could have a negative impact on our operations and results.. We are party to collective bargaining agreements covering a majority of our craft workforce. Although strikes, work stoppages and other labor disputes have not had a significant impact on our operations or results in the past, any such labor actions, or our inability to renew the collective bargaining agreements, could materially and adversely impact our operations and results if they occur in the future.. Our inability to properly utilize our workforce could have a negative impact on our profitability.. The extent to which we utilize our workforce affects our profitability. Underutilizing the workforce could result in lower gross margins and, consequently, a decrease in short-term profitability. On the other hand, overutilization of our workforce could negatively impact safety, employee satisfaction, and project execution, leading to a potential decline in future project awards. The utilization of our workforce is impacted by numerous factors, including:. •our estimates of headcount                                          requirements and our ability to manage attrition;. •efficiency in scheduling projects                                          and our ability to minimize downtime between project assignments;. •productivity;. •labor disputes; and. •availability of skilled labor                                          at any given time.. Our failure to comply with immigrant labor regulations could affect our business.. In certain markets, we rely heavily on immigrant labor. We have taken steps that we believe are sufficient and appropriate to ensure compliance with immigration laws. However, we cannot provide assurance that our management has identified, or will identify in the future, all illegal immigrants who work for us. The failure to identify illegal immigrants who work for us may result in fines or other penalties being imposed upon the company, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, results of operations and financial condition.. Our participation in construction joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners.. As part of our business, we are a party to special purpose, project specific joint venture arrangements, pursuant to which we typically jointly bid on and execute particular projects with other companies in the construction industry. Success on these joint projects depends upon the various risks discussed in these “Risk Factors” and on whether our joint venture partners satisfy their contractual obligations.. We and our joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of the joint ventures. If a joint venture partner fails to perform or is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities stemming from lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for our partner’s shortfall. Furthermore, if we are unable to adequately address our partner’s performance issues, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal liability to us, harm to our reputation and reduction to our profit on a project.. We may be unable to identify and contract with qualified Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (“DBE”) contractors to perform as subcontractors.. Certain of our projects include contract clauses requiring Disadvantaged Business Enterprise participation. The participation clauses may be in the form of a goal or in the form of a minimum amount of work that must be subcontracted to a DBE firm. If we fail to complete these projects with the minimum DBE participation, we may be held responsible for breach of contract, which may include restrictions on our ability to bid on future projects, as well as monetary damages. To the extent we are responsible for monetary damages, the total costs of the project could exceed the original estimates, we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project, and there could be a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Further, if we contract with a DBE contractor that is not properly qualified to perform a commercially useful function, we could be held responsible for violation of federal, state or local laws related to DBE contracting.. Timing of the award and performance of new contracts could have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flow.. A substantial portion of our revenues and earnings is generated from large-scale project awards. The timing of project awards is unpredictable and outside of our control. Awards, including expansions of existing projects, often involve complex and lengthy negotiations and competitive bidding processes. These processes can be impacted by a wide variety of factors, including a customer’s decision to not proceed with the development of a project, governmental approvals, financing contingencies, commodity prices, environmental conditions, and overall market and economic conditions. We may not win contracts that we have bid upon due to price, a customer’s perception of our ability to perform and/or perceived technology advantages held by others. Many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in a contract that we might not deem acceptable. Because a significant portion of our revenues is generated from large projects, our results of operations can fluctuate quarterly and annually depending on whether and when large project awards occur and the commencement and progress of work under large contracts already awarded. As a result, we are subject to the risk of losing new awards to competitors or the risk that revenue may not be derived from awarded projects as quickly as anticipated.. 11. The uncertainty of the timing of contract awards may also present difficulties in matching the size of our work crews with contract needs. In some cases, we may maintain and bear the cost of more ready work crews than are currently required, in anticipation of future needs for existing contracts or expected future contracts. If a contract is delayed or an expected contract award is not received, we would incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our anticipated profit.. In addition, the timing of the revenues, earnings and cash flows from our contracts can be delayed by a number of factors, including adverse weather conditions; other subcontractors delaying the progression of proceeding work; delays in receiving material and equipment from suppliers and services from subcontractors; and changes in the scope of work to be performed. Such delays, if they occur, could have material and adverse effects on our operating results for current and future periods until the affected contracts are completed.. Design/Build contracts subject us to the risks of design errors and omissions.. Design/Build project delivery provides the customer with a single point of responsibility for both design and construction. When we are awarded these projects we typically perform the design and engineering work in-house. In the event that a design error or omission by us causes damage, there is risk that we, our subcontractors or the respective professional liability or errors and omissions insurance would not be able to absorb the liability. Any liability resulting from an asserted design defect with respect to our construction projects may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.. Our dependence on a limited number of customers could adversely affect our business and results of operations.. Due to the size and nature of our regional construction contracts, one or a few customers have in the past, and may in the future, represent a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues and gross profits in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. For example, a single construction segment customer represented approximately 15% of our consolidated total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 24% and 11% of our consolidated total revenues for the Successor period from July 20, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and for the Predecessor period from January 1, 2016 through July 19, 2016, respectively. Similarly, our backlog frequently reflects multiple contracts for certain customers; therefore, one customer may comprise a significant percentage of backlog at a certain point in time. The loss of business from any one of such customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Also, a default or delay in payment on a significant scale by a customer may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.. Our dependence on subcontractors and suppliers of equipment and materials could increase our costs and impair our ability to complete contracts on a timely basis or at all, which would adversely affect our profits and cash flow.. We rely heavily on third-party subcontractors to perform some, and often a majority, of the work on many of our contracts. We also rely almost exclusively on third-party suppliers to provide the equipment and materials (including pipe, sheet metal and control systems) for our contracts. If we are unable to retain qualified subcontractors or suppliers, or if our subcontractors or suppliers do not perform as anticipated for any reason, our execution and profitability could be harmed. By contract, we remain liable to our customers for the performance or failures of our subcontractors and suppliers.. We generally do not bid on projects unless we have commitments from suppliers for the materials and equipment and from subcontractors for the services required to complete the projects at prices that have been included in the bid. Thus, to the extent that we cannot obtain commitments from our suppliers for materials and equipment, and from subcontractors for services needed, our ability to bid for contracts may be impaired. In addition, if a supplier or subcontractor is unable to deliver materials, equipment or services according to the negotiated terms of a supply/services agreement for any reason, including the deterioration of our financial condition, we may suffer delays and be required to purchase the materials, equipment and services from another source at a higher price or incur other unanticipated costs. This may reduce the profit to be realized, or result in a loss, on a contract.. Price increases in materials could affect our profitability.. We purchase materials, including sheet metal, steel and copper piping, electrical conduit, wire and other various materials from numerous sources. We also purchase equipment from various manufacturers. The prices we pay for these materials and equipment may be impacted by transportation costs, government regulations, import duties and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, general economic conditions and other circumstances beyond our control. Although we may attempt to pass on certain of these increased costs to our customers, we may not be able to pass all of these cost increases on to our customers. As a result, our margins may be adversely impacted by such cost increases.. Earnings for future periods may be impacted by impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets.. We carry a significant amount of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. We assess goodwill for impairment each year, and more frequently if circumstances suggest an impairment may have occurred. We may determine in the future that a significant impairment has occurred in the value of our unamortized intangible assets or fixed assets, which could require us to write off a portion of our assets and could adversely affect our financial condition or reported results of operations.. 12. Actual and potential claims, lawsuits and proceedings could ultimately reduce our profitability and liquidity and weaken our financial condition.. We have been and will continue to be named as a defendant in legal proceedings claiming damages in connection with the operation of our business. These actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers’ compensation, employment law violations and/or discrimination, breach of contract, or property damage. In addition, we may be subject to lawsuits involving allegations of violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws, or allegations of violations of applicable securities laws. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings. We also are, and will likely continue to be, from time to time a plaintiff in legal proceedings against customers, in which we seek to recover payment of contractual amounts we are owed, as well as claims for increased costs we incur. When appropriate, we will establish provisions against possible exposures, and adjust these provisions from time to time according to ongoing exposure. If the assumptions and estimates related to these exposures prove to be inadequate or inaccurate, we could experience a reduction in our profitability and liquidity and a weakening of our financial condition. In addition, claims, lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating the business.. We typically warrant the services we provide, guaranteeing the work performed against defects in workmanship and the material we supply. If warranty claims occur, we could be required to repair or replace warrantied work in place at our cost. In addition, our customers may elect to repair or replace the warrantied item by using the services of another provider and require us to pay for the cost of the repair or replacement. Costs incurred as a result of warranty claims could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.. Our use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenue or profits.. A material portion of our revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which results in recognizing contract revenue and earnings ratably over the contract term in the proportion that our actual costs bear to our estimated contract costs. The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenue, costs and profitability. We review our estimates of contract revenue, costs and profitability on an ongoing basis. Prior to contract completion, we may adjust our estimates on one or more occasions as a result of change orders to the original contract, collection disputes with the customer on amounts invoiced, or claims against the customer for increased costs incurred by us due to customer-induced delays and other factors. Contract losses are recognized in the fiscal period when the loss is determined. Contract profit estimates are also adjusted in the fiscal period in which it is determined that an adjustment is required. As a result of the requirements of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, the possibility exists, for example, that we could have estimated and reported a profit on a contract over several periods and later determined, usually near contract completion, that all or a portion of such previously estimated and reported profits were overstated. If this occurs, the full aggregate amount of the overstatement will be reported for the period in which such determination is made, thereby eliminating all or a portion of any profits from other contracts that would have otherwise been reported in such period, or even resulting in a loss being reported for such period. On a historical basis, we believe that we have made reasonably reliable estimates of the progress towards completion on our long-term contracts. However, given the uncertainties associated with these types of contracts, it is possible for actual costs to materially and adversely vary from estimates previously made, which may result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenue and profits.. A significant portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety bonds. Any difficulties in the financial and surety markets may cause a material adverse effect on our bonding capacity and availability.. In the past we have expanded, and it is possible we will continue to expand, the number and percentage of total contract dollars that require an underlying construction surety bond (bid, payment, and performance bonds). Historically, surety market conditions have experienced times of difficulty as a result of significant losses incurred by many surety companies and the results of macroeconomic trends outside of our control. Consequently, during times when less overall bonding capacity is available in the market, surety terms have become more expensive and more restrictive. We cannot guarantee our ability to maintain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future, which could preclude our ability to bid for certain contracts or successfully contract with some customers. Additionally, even if we continue to be able to access bonding capacity to sufficiently bond future work, we may be required to post collateral to secure bonds, which would decrease the liquidity we would have available for other purposes. Our surety providers are under no commitment to guarantee our access to new bonds in the future; thus, our ability to access or increase bonding capacity is at the sole discretion of our surety providers. If our surety companies were to limit or eliminate our access to bonds, the alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity from other surety companies, increasing business with clients that do not require bonds and posting other forms of collateral for project performance, such as letters of credit or cash. We may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. As such, if we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, it is likely we would be unable to compete for or work on certain projects.. 13. We place significant decision making powers with our subsidiaries’ management, which presents certain risks.. We believe that our practice of placing significant decision making powers with local management is important to our successful growth and allows us to be responsive to opportunities and to our customers’ needs. However, this practice presents certain risks, including the risk that we may be slower or less effective in our attempts to identify or react to problems affecting an important business issue than we would under a more centralized structure, or that we would be slower to identify a misalignment between a subsidiary’s and our overall business strategy. Further, if a subsidiary location fails to follow our compliance policies, we could be made party to a contract, arrangement or situation that requires the exposure of large liabilities or has less advantageous terms than is typically found in the market.. Information technology system failures, network disruptions or cyber security breaches could adversely affect our business.. We use sophisticated information technology systems, networks, and infrastructure in conducting some of our day-to-day operations and providing services to certain customers, including technology used for building designs, project modeling and scheduling. Information technology system failures, including suppliers’ or vendors’ system failures, could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, other business disruptions, or the loss of employee personal information. In addition, these systems, networks, and infrastructure may be vulnerable to deliberate cyber-attacks that interfere with their functionality or the confidentiality of our information or our customers’ data. Increasingly advanced cyber-attacks against rapidly evolving computer technologies pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and data. Despite efforts to protect confidential business information, personal data of employees and subcontractors, our information technology systems and those of our third-party service providers may be subject to system breaches. System breaches can lead to disclosure, modification and destruction of proprietary business data, personally identifiable information, other sensitive information, production downtime, and damage to our reputation, competitiveness and operations.  Of special note is our risk when implementing new capabilities.  As we implement new systems, many times both new and old systems run in parallel until all processes have successfully transferred to the new system and thorough testing has been performed. These events could impact our customers, employees and our reputation and lead to financial losses from remediation actions, loss of business or potential liability, or an increase in expense, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business.. Our insurance policies against many potential liabilities require high deductibles. Additionally, difficulties in the insurance markets may adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary insurance.. Although we maintain insurance policies with respect to our related exposures, these policies are subject to high deductibles; as such, we are, in effect, self-insured for substantially all of our typical claims. Our estimates of liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses and the appropriateness of the estimated liability are reviewed and updated quarterly. However, insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to the many relevant factors, the effects of which are often unknown, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents that have occurred but are not reported, and the effectiveness of our safety program. Our accruals are based on known facts, historical trends (both internal trends and industry averages) and our reasonable estimate of our future expenses. We believe our accruals are adequate. However, our risk management strategies and techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating the risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk. If any of the variety of instruments, processes or strategies we use to manage our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses that are not covered by our insurance policies (including potential punitive damages awards) or that exceed our accruals or coverage limits.. Additionally, insurance market conditions become more difficult for insurance consumers during periods when insurance companies suffer significant investment losses as well as casualty losses. Consequently, it is possible that insurance markets will become more expensive and restrictive. Also, our prior casualty loss history might adversely affect our ability to procure insurance within commercially reasonable ranges. As such, we may not be able to maintain commercially reasonable levels of insurance coverage in the future, which could preclude our ability to work on many projects. Our insurance providers are under no commitment to renew our existing insurance policies in the future; therefore, our ability to obtain necessary levels or kinds of insurance coverage are subject to market forces outside our control. If we are unable to obtain necessary levels of insurance, we likely would be unable to compete for or work on most projects.. If we experience delays and/or defaults in customer payments, we could be unable to recover all expenditures.. Due to the nature of our contracts, we sometimes commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from the customer in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures on projects as they are incurred. Delays in customer payments may require us to make a working capital investment. If a customer defaults in making their payments on a project to which we have devoted resources, it could have a material negative effect on our results of operations.. Misconduct by our employees, subcontractors or partners, or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could harm our reputation, damage our relationships with customers, reduce our revenue and profits, and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions.. Misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one or more of our employees, subcontractors or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Examples of such misconduct include employee or subcontractor theft, the failure to comply with safety standards, state-specific laws related to automobile operations (including mobile phone usage), laws and regulations, customer requirements, environmental laws, DBE regulatory compliance, and any other applicable laws or regulations. While we take precautions to prevent and detect these activities, such precautions may not be effective and are subject to inherent limitations, including human error and fraud. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, harm our reputation, damage relationships with customers, reduce our revenue and profits, and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions.. 14. Failure or circumvention of our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting could seriously harm our financial condition, results of operations, and business.. We plan to continue to maintain and strengthen internal controls and procedures to enhance the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure of our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting could harm our financial condition and results of operations.. Our management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are ineffective due to two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, and the market price of our securities may be negatively affected.. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with our 2017 audit, our management conducted an assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting. Due to the existence of two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were ineffective. Specifically, our management identified the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017:. ·Our controls around contract administration and our work-in-process schedule did not operate effectively, thereby resulting in net favorable gross profit and pre-tax income adjustments totaling $566,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Specifically, in certain limited instances, our work-in-process schedule was not accounted for in accordance with related billing and other contractual terms and, in those instances, our review of the work-in-process schedule did not operate at a precision level sufficient to detect errors in project accounting. Additionally, we have not yet completed a full employee access level review of all of our financially significant accounting systems; and. ·Although we have designed and implemented processes and internal controls over financial reporting relating to our job cost accruals, our personnel have not yet consistently executed such processes and related internal controls at the required precision level for us to conclude that the material weakness reported in our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K (the “2016 Form 10-K”) has been effectively remediated. In one instance, we did not identify that a significant accrual was already recorded in accounts payable. In other limited instances, amounts were improperly accrued for goods and services not received in the reporting period. These instances resulted in net unfavorable gross profit and pre-tax income adjustments totaling $160,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017.. See Part II, Item 9A Controls and Procedures for further discussion of these material weaknesses.. Our remediation efforts have and will continue to require significant resources and attention from our management. If we are unable to remediate these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or if we identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our management will be unable to assert in future reports that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting are effective. This could cause investors, counterparties and customers to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements and reports and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, access to capital markets and perceptions of our creditworthiness and/or a decline in the market price of our common stock. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. 15. We have subsidiary operations throughout the United States and are exposed to multiple state and local regulations, as well as federal laws and requirements applicable to government contractors. Changes in laws, regulations or requirements, or a material failure of any of our subsidiaries or us to comply with any of them, could increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business.. Our branch locations operate in 18 states, which exposes us to a variety of state and local laws and regulations, particularly those pertaining to contractor licensing requirements. These laws and regulations govern many aspects of our business, and there are often different standards and requirements in different locations. In addition, our subsidiaries that perform work for federal government entities are subject to additional federal laws and regulatory and contractual requirements. Changes in any of these laws, or any subsidiary’s material failure to comply with them, can adversely impact our operations by, among other things, increasing costs, distracting management’s time and attention from other items, and harming our reputation.. As Federal Government Contractors under applicable federal regulations, our subsidiaries are subject to a number of rules and regulations, and our contracts with government entities are subject to audit. Violations of the applicable rules and regulations could result in a subsidiary being barred from future government contracts.. Federal Government Contractors must comply with many regulations and other requirements that relate to the award, administration and performance of government contracts. A violation of these laws and regulations could result in imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of a government contract, or debarment from bidding on government contracts in the future. Further, despite our decentralized nature, a violation at one of our locations could impact the ability of the other locations to bid on and perform government contracts; additionally, because of our decentralized nature, we face risk in maintaining compliance with all local, state and federal government contracting requirements. Prohibition against bidding on future government contracts could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. Past and future environmental, safety and health regulations could impose significant additional costs on us that reduce our profits.. HVAC systems are subject to various environmental statutes and regulations, including the Clean Air Act and those regulating the production, servicing and disposal of certain ozone-depleting refrigerants used in HVAC systems. There can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change significantly in the future. Various local, state and federal laws and regulations impose licensing standards on technicians who install and service HVAC systems. And additional laws, regulations and standards apply to contractors who perform work that is being funded by public money, particularly federal public funding. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to substantial fines, the loss of licenses or potentially debarment from future publicly-funded work. It is impossible to predict the full nature and effect of judicial, legislative or regulatory developments relating to health and safety regulations and environmental protection regulations applicable to our operations.. Unsatisfactory safety performance may subject us to penalties, affect customer relationships, result in higher operating costs, negatively impact employee morale and result in higher employee turnover.. Our projects are conducted at a variety of sites including construction sites and industrial facilities. Each location is subject to numerous safety risks, including electrocutions, fires, explosions, mechanical failures, weather-related incidents, motor vehicle and transportation accidents and damage to equipment. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and other consequential damages, and could lead to suspension of operations, large damage claims and, in extreme cases, criminal liability. While we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions to minimize safety risks, we have experienced serious accidents in the past and may experience additional accidents in the future. Serious accidents may subject us to penalties, civil litigation or criminal prosecution. Claims for damages to persons, including claims for bodily injury or loss of life, could result in significant costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, like other companies in our industry, we track our injury history in the form of an Experience Modification Rate (“EMR”). In the event that the EMR associated with certain of our operating units exceeds the minimum threshold set by customers, we may be unable to pursue certain projects. Poor safety performance could also jeopardize our relationships with our customers and harm our reputation.. 16. If we do not effectively manage the size and cost of our operations, our existing infrastructure may become either strained or over-burdensome, and we may be unable to increase revenue growth.. The growth that we have experienced in the past, and that we may experience in the future, may provide challenges to our organization, requiring us to expand our personnel and operations. Future growth may strain our infrastructure, operations and other managerial and operating resources. We have also experienced severe constriction in the markets in which we operated in the past and, as a result, in our operating requirements. Failing to maintain the appropriate cost structure for a particular economic cycle may result in us incurring costs that affect our profitability. If our business resources become strained or over-burdensome, our earnings may be adversely affected and we may be unable to increase revenue growth. Further, we may undertake contractual commitments that exceed our labor resources, which could also adversely affect our earnings and ability to increase revenue growth.. We are susceptible to adverse weather conditions, which may harm our business and financial results.. Our business may be adversely affected by severe weather in areas where we have significant operations. Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include:. •curtailment of services;. •suspension of operations;. •inability to meet performance                                          schedules in accordance with contracts and potential liability for liquidated damages;. •injuries or fatalities;. •weather related damage to facilities;. •disruption of information systems;. •inability to receive machinery,                                          equipment and materials at jobsites; and. •loss of productivity.. Force majeure events, including natural disasters and terrorists’ actions, could negatively impact our business, which may affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.. Force majeure, or extraordinary events beyond the control of the contracting parties, such as natural and man-made disasters, or terrorist actions, could negatively impact us. We attempt to negotiate contract language seeking to mitigate force majeure events in both public and private client contracts. When successful, we remain obligated to perform our services after most extraordinary events subject to relief that may be available pursuant to a force majeure clause. If we are not able to react quickly to force majeure events, our operations may be affected significantly, which would have a negative impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.. Deliberate, malicious acts, including terrorism and sabotage, could damage our facilities, disrupt our operations or injure employees, contractors, customers or the public and result in liability to us.. Intentional acts of destruction could damage or destroy our facilities, reducing our operational production capacity and requiring us to repair or replace facilities at substantial cost. Additionally, employees, contractors and the public could suffer substantial physical injury from acts of terrorism for which we could be liable. Governmental authorities may also impose security or other requirements that could make our operations more difficult or costly. The consequences of any such actions could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.. 17. Our future acquisitions may not be successful.. We expect to pursue selective acquisitions of businesses. We cannot assure that we will be able to locate acquisitions or that we will be able to consummate transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us, or that acquired businesses will be profitable. Acquisitions may expose us to additional business risks different than those we have traditionally experienced. We also may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses and successfully managing the growth we expect to experience from these acquisitions.. We may choose to finance future acquisitions with debt, equity, cash or a combination of the three. Future acquisitions could dilute earnings. To the extent we succeed in making acquisitions, a number of risks will result, including:. •     the assumption of material liabilities (including     for environmental-related costs and multiemployer pension plans);. •     failure of due diligence to uncover situations     that could result in legal exposure or to quantify the true liability exposure from known risks;. •     the diversion of management’s attention     from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations;. •     difficulties in the assimilation and retention     of employees, in the assimilation of different cultures and practices, in the assimilation of broad and geographically dispersed     personnel and operations, and the retention of employees generally;. •     the risk of additional financial and accounting     challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and internal controls;. •     the assumption of multiemployer pension plans     (“MEPP”) liability in the event of an acquisition with existing unions. •     potential inability to realize the cost savings     or other financial benefits anticipated prior to the acquisition; and. •     increased exposure to challenges to the validity     of our “double breasted” structure (i.e., union and open shop subsidiaries) under the National Labor Relations     Act if an “open shop” business is acquired.. The failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the costs associated with a failed acquisition could also have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.. A change in tax laws or regulations of any federal or state jurisdiction in which we operate could increase our tax burden and otherwise adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.. We continue to assess the impact of various U.S. federal or state legislative proposals that could result in a material increase to our U.S. federal or state taxes. We cannot predict whether any specific legislation will be enacted or the terms of any such legislation. However, if such proposals were to be enacted, or if modifications were to be made to certain existing regulations, the consequences could have a material adverse impact on us, including increasing our tax burden, increasing the cost of tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.. Our obligation to contribute to multiemployer pension plans could give rise to significant expenses and liabilities in the future.. We contribute to approximately 40 multiemployer pension plans in the United States under collective bargaining agreements that generally provide pension benefits to employees covered by these agreements. Approximately 53% of our current employees are members of collective bargaining units. Our Successor contributions to these plans were approximately $36.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $16.1 million for the period from July 20, 2016 through December 31, 2016. Our Predecessor contributions to multiemployer pension plans were approximately $16.7 million for the period from January 1, 2016 through July 19, 2016. The costs of providing benefits through such plans have increased in recent years. The amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multiemployer pension plans will depend upon many factors, including the outcome of collective bargaining, actions taken by trustees who manage the plans, government regulations, the actual return on assets held in the plans and the potential payment of a withdrawal liability. Based upon the information available to us from the multiemployer pension plans’ administrators, we believe that some of these multiemployer pension plans are underfunded. The unfunded liabilities of these plans may result in required increased future payments by us and the other participating employers. Underfunded multiemployer pension plans may impose a surcharge requiring additional pension contributions. Our risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan.. 18. With limited exception, an employer who is obligated under a collective bargaining agreement to contribute  to a multiemployer pension plan is liable, upon termination of such contribution obligation to the plan or withdrawal from a plan, for its proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested pension liabilities. In the event that we withdraw from participation in a plan, applicable law could require us to make withdrawal liability contributions to such plan, and we would have to reflect that liability and the related expense in our consolidated financial statements. Our withdrawal liability payable to an individual multiemployer pension plan would depend on the extent of the plan’s funding of vested benefits. If the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate have significant underfunded liabilities, such underfunding will increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability. No liability for underfunding of multiemployer pension plans was recorded in our Successor Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, or the period from July 20, 2016 through December 31, 2016, or in our Predecessor Consolidated Financial Statements for the period from January 1, 2016 through July 19, 2016.. Rising inflation and/or interest rates, or deterioration of the United States economy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in interest rates, could have a negative impact on our business. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. To the extent that Congress is unable to lower United States debt substantially, a decrease in federal spending could result, which could negatively impact the ability of government agencies to fund existing or new infrastructure projects. In addition, such actions could have a material adverse effect on the financial markets and economic conditions in the United States and throughout the world, which may limit our ability and the ability of our customers to obtain financing and/or could impair our ability to execute our acquisition strategy. These and related economic factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.. Failure to remain in compliance with covenants under our debt and credit agreements or service our indebtedness could adversely impact our business.. Our Credit Agreement and Subordinated Loan Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) and other debt obligations include certain debt covenants, including, certain financial covenants, are more described in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Our failure to comply with any of these covenants, or to pay principal, interest or other amounts when due thereunder, would constitute an event of default under the applicable agreements. Under certain circumstances, the occurrence of an event of default under one of these agreements (or the acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness under one of these agreements) may constitute an event of default under one or more of our other debt or surety agreements. Default under our debt agreements could result in, among other things, us no longer being entitled to borrow under one or more of the agreements, acceleration of the maturity of outstanding indebtedness under the agreements, and/or foreclosure on any collateral securing the obligations under the agreements. If we are unable to service our debt obligations, or if we are unable to comply with our financial or other debt covenants, and our indebtedness becomes immediately due and payable, we could be forced to curtail our operations, reorganize our capital structure (including through bankruptcy proceedings), or liquidate some or all of our assets in a manner that could cause holders of our securities to experience a partial or total loss of their investment.. Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.. Borrowings under our Credit Agreement are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though any amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. As of December 31, 2017, we had $15.9 million of available capacity under our revolving line of credit, $5.7 million outstanding under our revolving line of credit and $17.6 million outstanding under the term loan provided by the Credit Agreement. In addition, we may determine to enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of variable for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk and could be subject to credit risk themselves.. Risks Related to Our Common Stock. The price of our common stock may be volatile.. The market price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things:. •actual or anticipated variations                                          in our quarterly results of operations;. •recommendations by securities                                          analysts;. •operating and stock price performance                                          of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;. •news reports relating to trends,                                          concerns and other issues in the financial services industry generally;. •perceptions in the marketplace                                          regarding us and/or our competitors;. •new technology used, or services                                          offered, by competitors; and. •changes in government regulations.. In addition, if the market for stocks in our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.. 19. A significant portion of our common stock is controlled by insiders, who currently own, in the aggregate, approximately 35% of our outstanding shares of common stock and, as a result, are able to exert significant control over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.. As of December 31, 2017, our officers, directors and holders of greater than 10% of our common stock, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 35% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As such, our insiders are able to significantly influence matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors, certain decisions relating to our capital structure, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of our other stockholders.. If equity research analysts publish unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.. The trading market for our common stock could be affected by equity research analysts’ research or reports about us and our business. The price of our stock could decline if one or more securities analysts downgrade our stock or if analysts issue other unfavorable commentary about us or our business. In addition, if any of these analysts ceases coverage of us, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our common stock price or trading volume to decline and our common stock to be less liquid.. Future equity issuances could result in dilution, which could cause our common stock price to decline.. We are generally not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock, up to the 100,000,000 shares of voting common stock authorized by our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which could be increased by a vote of a majority of our shares. We may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future pursuant to current or future equity compensation plans, upon conversions of preferred stock or debt, upon exercise of warrants or in connection with future acquisitions or financings. If we choose to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock for any reason, the issuance would have a dilutive effect on the holders of our common stock and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our common stock.. Future sales of our common stock may cause our common stock price to decline.. Any transfer or sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such transfer or sales might occur may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. As of March 30, 2018, we had an aggregate of 7,542,249 shares of common stock outstanding, of which 2,632,391 shares were held by our directors, officers and holders of greater than 10% of our common stock. We registered the resale of the shares held by such stockholders and so they are freely tradeable under the Securities Act, except for any shares purchased by a person who is an affiliate of the Company. Since these shares are now freely tradeable, a substantial number of shares of our common stock may now be sold in the public market, which may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.. In addition, our board has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. In the event that we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.. 20. We are an “emerging growth company,” and the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.. We are an “emerging growth company,” as described in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. These include, without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced financial reporting requirements, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments. The JOBS Act also permits an “emerging growth company” such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies, which we intend to take advantage of.. We may take advantage of these provisions until December 31, 2019, unless we earlier cease to be an emerging growth company, which would occur if our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion (adjusted for inflation), if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, or if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. Investors may find our common stock less attractive if we rely on the exemptions, which may result in a less active trading market and increased volatility in our stock price.. 21.
