[1] "ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORS.. <U+FEFF>. Business Risks. <U+FEFF>. Expanding our brands into new footwear and apparel markets may be difficult and expensive, and if we are unable to successfully continue such expansion, our brands may be adversely affected, and we may not achieve our planned sales growth.. <U+FEFF>. Our growth strategy is founded substantially on the expansion of our brands into new footwear and apparel markets.  New products that we introduce may not be successful with consumers or one or more of our brands may fall out of favor with consumers.  If we are unable to anticipate, identify or react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, we may not grow as fast as we plan to grow or our sales may decline, and our brand image and operating performance may suffer.. <U+FEFF>. Furthermore, achieving market acceptance for new products will likely require us to exert substantial product development and marketing efforts, which could result in a material increase in our selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses, and there can be no assurance that we will have the resources necessary to undertake such efforts.  Material increases in our SG&A expenses could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. We may also encounter difficulties in producing new products that we did not anticipate during the development stage.  Our development schedules for new products are difficult to predict and are subject to change as a result of shifting priorities in response to consumer preferences and competing products.  If we are not able to efficiently manufacture newly-developed products in quantities sufficient to support retail distribution, we may not be able to recoup our investment in the development of new products.  Failure to gain market acceptance for new products that we introduce could impede our growth, reduce our profits, adversely affect the image of our brands, erode our competitive position and result in long term harm to our business.. <U+FEFF>. A majority of our products are produced outside the U.S. where we are subject to the risks of international commerce.. <U+FEFF>. A majority of our products are produced in the Dominican Republic and China.  Therefore, our business is subject to the following risks of doing business offshore:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe imposition of additional United States legislation and regulations relating to imports, including quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforeign governmental regulation and taxation;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in foreign exchange rates;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in economic conditions;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttransportation conditions and costs in the Pacific and Caribbean;. 9. Table of Contents. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the political stability of these countries; and. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in relationships between the United States and these countries.. <U+FEFF>. Changes in any of these factors could materially increase our costs of products and we may not be able to recover all of our cost increases through price increases to our customers. If any of these factors were to render the conduct of business in these countries undesirable or impracticable, we would have to manufacture or source our products elsewhere.  There can be no assurance that additional sources or products would be available to us or, if available, that these sources could be relied on to provide product at terms favorable to us.  The occurrence of any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. Changes to United States tax, tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.. <U+FEFF>. The current political climate has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries.    We source products from manufacturers located outside of the U.S., primarily in China.   Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported products or the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.. <U+FEFF>. We conduct a portion of our business pursuant to U.S. military contracts, which are subject to unique risks.. <U+FEFF>. We conduct a portion of our business pursuant to U.S. military contracts which are subject to unique risks.  In 2017,  15.1% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. military contracts.  Business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks.  The U.S. military may modify, curtail or choose not to renew one or more of our contracts.  In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. military contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints and/or changes in U.S. military strategy.  Our contracts with the U.S. military are fixed-price contracts.  While fixed price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues. The U.S. military provides preference on contract bids to small businesses and our current company structure classifies us as a large business which could have an effect on our ability to be awarded new contracts in the future.. <U+FEFF>. Our success depends on our ability to anticipate consumer trends.. <U+FEFF>. Demand for our products may be adversely affected by changing consumer trends.  Our future success will depend upon our ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and technical design or material developments in a timely manner.  The failure to adequately anticipate or respond to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. Loss of services of our key personnel could adversely affect our business.. <U+FEFF>. The development of our business has been, and will continue to be dependent on execution at all levels of our organization which requires an experienced and talented executive team.  The loss of service of any of the executive officers or key employees could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  We have entered into employment agreements with several executive officers and key employees, and also offer compensation packages designed to attract and retain talent.. <U+FEFF>. We depend on a limited number of suppliers for key production materials, and any disruption in the supply of such materials could interrupt product manufacturing and increase product costs.. <U+FEFF>. We purchase raw materials from a number of domestic and foreign sources.  We do not have any long-term supply contracts for the purchase of our raw materials, except for limited blanket orders on leather.  The principal raw materials used in the production of our footwear, in terms of dollar value, are leather, Gore-Tex waterproof breathable fabric, Cordura nylon fabric and soling materials.  Availability or change in the prices of our raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. 10. Table of Contents. Our outdoor and insulated products are seasonal and are sensitive to weather conditions.. <U+FEFF>. We have historically experienced significant seasonal fluctuations in our business because we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales of our outdoor products.  Many of our outdoor products are used by consumers in cold or wet weather. As a result, a majority of orders for these products are placed by our retailers in January through April for delivery in July through October.  In order to meet demand, we must manufacture and source outdoor footwear year round to be in a position to ship advance orders for these products during the last two quarters of each year.  Accordingly, average inventory levels have been highest during the second and third quarters of each year and sales have been highest in the last two quarters of each year.  There is no assurance that we will have either sufficient inventory to satisfy demand in any particular quarter or have sufficient demand to sell substantially all of our inventory without significant markdowns. Mild or dry weather has in the past and may in the future have a material adverse effect on sales of our products, particularly if mild or dry weather conditions occur in broad geographical areas during late fall or early winter.. <U+FEFF>. Our business could suffer if our third-party manufacturers violate labor laws or fail to conform to generally accepted ethical standards.. <U+FEFF>. We require our third-party manufacturers to meet our standards for working conditions and other matters before we are willing to place business with them.  As a result, we may not always obtain the lowest cost production.  Moreover, we do not control our third-party manufacturers or their respective labor practices.  If one of our third-party manufacturers violates generally accepted labor standards by, for example, using forced or indentured labor or child labor, failing to pay compensation in accordance with local law, failing to operate its factories in compliance with local safety regulations or diverging from other labor practices generally accepted as ethical, we likely would cease dealing with that manufacturer, and we could suffer an interruption in our product supply.  In addition, such a manufacturer's actions could result in negative publicity and may damage our reputation and the value of our brand and discourage retail customers and consumers from buying our products.. <U+FEFF>. The growth of our business will be dependent upon the availability of adequate capital.. <U+FEFF>. The growth of our business will depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of equity and debt financing.  We cannot assure that our operations will generate positive cash flow or that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on acceptable terms or at all.  Our revolving credit facility contains provisions that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make substantial asset sales that might otherwise be used to finance our expansion.  Security interests in substantially all of our assets, which may further limit our access to certain capital markets or lending sources, secure our obligations under our revolving credit facility.  Moreover, the actual availability of funds under our revolving credit facility is limited to specified percentages of our eligible inventory and accounts receivable.  Accordingly, opportunities for increasing our cash on hand through sales of inventory would be partially offset by reduced availability under our revolving credit facility.  As a result, we may not be able to finance our current expansion plans.. <U+FEFF>. We must comply with the restrictive covenants contained in our revolving credit facility.. <U+FEFF>. Our credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial restrictive covenants that impose restrictions on our operations, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments of other restricted payments, sell or otherwise dispose of assets and engage in other activities.  Any failure by us to comply with the restrictive covenants could result in an event of default under those borrowing arrangements, in which case the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.  Our credit facility contains a restrictive covenant which requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio. This restrictive covenant is only in effect upon a triggering event taking place (as defined in the credit facility agreement).  At December 31, 2017, there was no triggering event and the covenant was not in effect.. <U+FEFF>. We face intense competition, including competition from companies with significantly greater resources than ours, and if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies, our market share may decline and our business could be harmed.. <U+FEFF>. The footwear and apparel industries are intensely competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future.  A number of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technological, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution resources than we do, as well as greater brand awareness in the footwear market.  Our ability to succeed depends on our ability to remain competitive with respect to the quality, design, price and timely delivery of products.  Competition could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. 11. Table of Contents. We currently manufacture a portion of our products and we may not be able to do so in the future at costs that are competitive with those of competitors who source their goods.. <U+FEFF>. We currently plan to retain our internal manufacturing capability in order to continue benefiting from expertise we have gained with respect to footwear manufacturing methods conducted at our manufacturing facilities.  We continue to evaluate our manufacturing facilities and third-party manufacturing alternatives in order to determine the appropriate size and scope of our manufacturing facilities.  There can be no assurance that the costs of products that continue to be manufactured by us can remain competitive with products sourced from third parties.. <U+FEFF>. We rely on our distribution center in Logan, Ohio and if there is a natural disaster or other serious disruption at this facility, we may be unable to deliver merchandise effectively to our retailers.. <U+FEFF>. We rely on our distribution center located in Logan, Ohio. Any natural disaster or other serious disruption at any of this facility due to fire, tornado, flood, terrorist attack or any other cause could damage a portion of our inventory or impair our ability to use our distribution center as a docking location for merchandise.  Either of these occurrences could impair our ability to adequately supply our retailers and harm our operating results.. <U+FEFF>. We are subject to certain environmental and other regulations.. <U+FEFF>. Some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal, state, local and international environmental and pollution laws, including those relating to the storage, use, discharge, disposal and labeling of, and human exposure to, hazardous and toxic materials.  Compliance with current or future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire additional expensive equipment, modify our manufacturing processes or incur other significant expenses.  In addition, we could incur costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims or could be required to incur substantial investigation or remediation costs, if we were to violate or become liable under any environmental laws. Liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault.  There can be no assurance that violations of environmental laws or regulations have not occurred in the past and will not occur in the future as a result of our inability to obtain permits, human error, equipment failure or other causes, and any such violations could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. If our efforts to establish and protect our trademarks, patents and other intellectual property are unsuccessful, the value of our brands could suffer.. <U+FEFF>. We regard certain of our footwear designs as proprietary and rely on patents to protect those designs.  We believe that the ownership of patents is a significant factor in our business. Existing intellectual property laws afford only limited protection of our proprietary rights, and it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain of our footwear designs or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.  If our patents are found to be invalid, however, to the extent they have served, or would in the future serve, as a barrier to entry to our competitors, such invalidity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. We own U.S. registrations for many our trademarks, trade names and designs, including such marks as Rocky, Georgia Boot, Durango, and Lehigh. Additional trademarks, trade names and designs are the subject of pending federal applications for registration. We also use and have common law rights in certain trademarks.  Over time, we have increased distribution of our goods in several foreign countries.  Accordingly, we have applied for trademark registrations in a number of these countries.  We intend to enforce our trademarks and trade names against unauthorized use by third parties.. <U+FEFF>. Our success depends on our ability to forecast sales.. <U+FEFF>. Our investments in infrastructure and product inventory are based on sales forecasts and are necessarily made in advance of actual sales.  The markets in which we do business are highly competitive, and our business is affected by a variety of factors, including brand awareness, changing consumer preferences, product innovations, susceptibility to fashion trends, retail market conditions, weather conditions and economic conditions, and other factors.  One of our principal challenges is to improve our ability to predict these factors in order to enable us to better match production with demand.  In addition, our growth over the years has created the need to increase the investment in infrastructure and product inventory and to enhance our systems.  To the extent sales forecasts are not achieved, costs associated with the infrastructure and carrying costs of product inventory would represent a higher percentage of revenue, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. 12. Table of Contents. A privacy breach could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and reputation.. <U+FEFF>. We rely heavily on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business, including electronic messaging, digital marketing efforts and the collection and retention of customer data and employee information. We also rely on third parties to process credit card transactions, perform online e-commerce and social media activities and retain data relating to the Company's financial position and results of operations, strategic initiatives and other important information.  Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to cyber-security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events.  Any misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information, whether by us or by our third-party service providers, could damage our reputation and our customers' willingness to purchase our products, which may adversely affect our business.  In addition, we could incur liabilities and remediation costs, including regulatory fines, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and costs for providing credit monitoring or other benefits to customers or employees affected. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our systems.. <U+FEFF>. Our dividend policy may change.. <U+FEFF>. Although we have paid dividends to our shareholders, we have no obligation to continue doing so and may change our dividend policy at any time without notice to our shareholders. Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such cash dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments.. <U+FEFF>. Risks Related to Our Industry. <U+FEFF>. Because the footwear market is sensitive to decreased consumer spending and slow economic cycles, if general economic conditions deteriorate, many of our customers may significantly reduce their purchases from us or may not be able to pay for our products in a timely manner.. <U+FEFF>. The footwear industry has been subject to cyclical variation and decline in performance when consumer spending decreases or softness appears in the retail market.  Many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the footwear industry, including:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral business conditions;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinterest rates;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of consumer credit;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tweather;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreases in prices of nondiscretionary goods;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttaxation; and. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconsumer confidence in future economic conditions.. <U+FEFF>. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our products, may decline during recessionary periods and also may decline at other times when disposable income is lower.  A downturn in regional economies where we sell products also reduces sales.. <U+FEFF>. The continued shift in the marketplace from traditional independent retailers to large discount mass merchandisers may result in decreased margins.. <U+FEFF>. A continued shift in the marketplace from traditional independent retailers to large discount mass merchandisers has increased the pressure on many footwear manufacturers to sell products to these mass merchandisers at less favorable margins.  Because of competition from large discount mass merchandisers, a number of our small retailing customers have gone out of business, and in the future more of these customers may go out of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. 13. Table of Contents. If we do not effectively respond to the trend of consumer shopping moving to online retailers it may negatively impact our business.. <U+FEFF>. The retail industry is rapidly changing and we must ensure we are evolving both our own online e-commerce websites as well as providing digital assistance to our wholesale customers to support their e-commerce websites. Failure to timely identify and effectively respond to the online trends of the retail industry could negatively impact our product reach and market share. We are making technology investments in our websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to improve or develop relevant technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>"
