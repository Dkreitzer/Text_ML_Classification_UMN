[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. In addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the following factors when evaluating the Company. An investment in the Company is subject to risks inherent in our business. The trading price of the shares of the Company is affected by the performance of our business relative to, among other things, competition, market conditions and general economic and industry conditions. The value of an investment in the Company may decrease, resulting in a loss.. RISK FACTORS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS. We have no ability to control the market price for natural gas and oil. Natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely, and a continued substantial or extended decline in natural gas and oil prices would adversely affect our revenues, profitability and growth and could have a material adverse effect on the business, the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend significantly on natural gas and crude oil prices. Natural gas and crude oil prices remained relatively low through 2017. While natural gas prices have remained consistent with 2017 levels, crude oil prices increased slightly during the final months of 2017 and throughout early 2018. The markets for these commodities are volatile and prices received affect the amount of future cash flow available for capital expenditures and repayment of indebtedness and our ability to raise additional capital. Lower prices also affect the amount of natural gas and oil that we can economically produce. Factors that can cause price fluctuations include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOverall economic conditions, domestic and global..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe domestic and foreign supply of natural gas and oil..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe level of consumer product demand..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAdverse weather conditions and natural disasters..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe price and availability of competitive fuels such as LNG, heating oil and coal..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPolitical conditions in the Middle East and other natural gas and oil producing regions..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil exporting nations to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe level of LNG imports and any LNG exports..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe level of natural gas exports..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDomestic and foreign governmental regulations..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSpecial taxes on production..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAccess to pipelines and gas processing plants..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe loss of tax credits and deductions.. 18. Table of Contents. A substantial or extended decline in natural gas and oil prices could have a material adverse effect on our access to capital and the quantities of natural gas and oil that may be economically produced by us. The Company may utilize financial derivative contracts, such as swaps, costless collars and puts on commodity prices, to reduce exposure to potential declines in commodity prices, however, these derivative contracts may not be sufficient to mitigate the effect of lower commodity prices.. Part of our strategy involves drilling in new or emerging plays; therefore, our drilling results in these areas are not certain.. The results of our drilling in new or emerging plays are more uncertain than drilling results in areas that are more developed and with longer production history. Since new or emerging plays and new formations have limited production history, we are less able to use past drilling results in those areas to help predict our future drilling results. The ultimate success of these drilling and completion strategies and techniques in these formations will be better evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are better established. Accordingly, our drilling results are subject to greater risks in these areas and could be unsuccessful. We may be unable to execute our expected drilling program in these areas because of disappointing drilling results, capital constraints, lease expirations, access to adequate gathering systems or pipeline take-away capacity, availability of drilling rigs and other services or otherwise, and/or crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids price declines. To the extent we are unable to execute our expected drilling program in these areas, our return on investment may not be as attractive as we anticipate and our common stock price may decrease. We could incur material write-downs of unevaluated properties, and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future if our drilling results are unsuccessful.. Initial production rates in shale plays tend to decline steeply in the first twelve months of production and are not necessarily indicative of sustained production rates.. Our future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of production from existing wells. Initial production rates in shale plays tend to decline steeply in the first twelve months of production and are not necessarily indicative of sustained production rates. As a result, we generally must locate and develop or acquire new crude oil or natural gas reserves to offset declines in these initial production rates. If we are unable to do so, these declines in initial production rates may result in a decrease in our overall production and revenue over time.. Our development and exploration operations require substantial capital, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a loss of undeveloped acreage and/or a decline in our crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves.. The oil and gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration, development, production and acquisition of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves. We intend to finance our future capital expenditures primarily with cash flow from operations, borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit agreement and/or proceeds from non-core asset sales. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of variables, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur proved reserves..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe level of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids we are able to produce from existing wells..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe prices at which crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are sold..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves.. If our revenues decrease as a result of lower crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels, to further develop and exploit our current properties, or to conduct exploratory activity. In order to fund our capital expenditures, we may need to seek additional financing. Our credit agreements contain covenants restricting our ability to incur additional indebtedness without the consent of the lenders. Our lenders may withhold this consent in their sole discretion. In addition, if our borrowing base redetermination results in a lower borrowing base under our senior secured revolving credit agreement, we may be unable to obtain financing otherwise currently available under our senior secured revolving credit agreement. As part of the regular redetermination schedule, the borrowing base on our revolving credit agreement was redetermined at $115 million effective November 9, 2017 and. 19. Table of Contents. through May 01, 2018. See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity.\". In addition, our ability to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness is uncertain and will be affected by our future performance and events or circumstances beyond our control. For example, at December 31, 2017, we were not in compliance with the Current Ratio covenant under our credit agreement, although we obtained a  waiver for such non-compliance. Any future failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default under such indebtedness and the potential foreclosure on the collateral securing such debt, and could cause a cross-default under any of our other outstanding indebtedness.. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. In particular, the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has increased substantially while the availability of funds from those markets generally has diminished significantly. Also, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets generally has increased as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards, refused to refinance existing debt at maturity on terms that are similar to existing debt, and reduced, or in some cases ceased, to provide funding to borrowers. The failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves.. We rely on third-party contract operators to drill, complete and manage some of our wells, production platforms, pipelines and processing facilities and, as a result, we have limited control over the daily operations of such equipment and facilities.. We depend upon the services of third-party operators to operate drilling rigs, completion operations, offshore production platforms, pipelines, gas processing facilities and the infrastructure required to produce and market our natural gas, condensate and oil. We have limited influence over the conduct of operations by third-party operators. As a result, we have little control over how frequently and how long our operations are down or our production is shut-in when problems, weather and other production shut-ins occur. Poor performance on the part of, or errors or accidents attributable to, the operator of a project in which we participate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.. Failure of our working interest partners to fund their share of development costs could result in the delay or cancellation of future projects, which could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. Natural gas and crude oil prices remained relatively low through most of 2017, and while natural gas prices have remained consistent with 2017 levels, crude oil prices increased slightly during the final months of 2017 and throughout early 2018. An extended or more severe downturn could have material adverse effects on the liquidity of our working interest partners.  Our working interest partners must be able to fund their share of investment costs through cash flow from operations, external credit facilities, or other sources.  If our partners are not able to fund their share of costs, it could result in the delay or cancellation of future projects, resulting in a reduction of our reserves and production, which could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. We are exposed to the credit risks of our customers and derivative counterparties, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers or derivative counterparties could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. We are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, which risks may increase during periods of economic uncertainty. Furthermore, some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to us. To the extent one or more of our significant customers is in financial distress or commences bankruptcy proceedings, contracts with these customers may be subject to renegotiation or rejection under applicable provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code. In addition, our risk management activities are subject to the risks that a counterparty may not perform its obligation under the applicable derivative instrument, the terms of the derivative instruments are imperfect, and our risk management policies and procedures are not properly followed. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers or our derivative counterparties could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. 20. Table of Contents. Repeated offshore production shut-ins can possibly damage our well bores.. Our offshore well bores are required to be shut-in from time to time due to a variety of issues, including a combination of weather, mechanical problems, sand production, bottom sediment, water and paraffin associated with our condensate production, as well as downstream third-party facility and pipeline shut-ins. In addition, shut-ins are necessary from time to time to upgrade and improve the production handling capacity at related downstream platform, gas processing and pipeline infrastructure. In addition to negatively impacting our near term revenues and cash flow, repeated production shut-ins may damage our well bores if repeated excessively or not executed properly. The loss of a well bore due to damage could require us to drill additional wells.. Natural gas and oil reserves are depleting assets and the failure to replace our reserves would adversely affect our production and cash flows.. Our future natural gas and oil production depends on our success in finding or acquiring new reserves. If we fail to replace reserves, our level of production and cash flows will be adversely impacted. Production from natural gas and oil properties decline as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. Our total proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced unless we conduct other successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. Further, the majority of our reserves are proved developed producing. Accordingly, we do not have significant opportunities to increase our production from our existing proved reserves. Our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of natural gas and oil reserves would be impaired to the extent cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. We may not be successful in exploring for, developing or acquiring additional reserves. If we are not successful, our future production and revenues will be adversely affected.. Reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could materially affect the quantities of our reserves.. There are numerous uncertainties in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves and their value, including many factors that are beyond our control. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities of reserves shown in this report.. In order to prepare these estimates, our independent third-party petroleum engineers must project production rates and timing of development expenditures as well as analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data, and the extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions relating to matters such as natural gas and oil prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds.. Actual future production, natural gas and oil prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and pre-tax net present value of reserves shown in a reserve report. In addition, estimates of our proved reserves may be adjusted to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing natural gas and oil prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control and may prove to be incorrect over time. As a result, our estimates may require substantial upward or downward revisions if subsequent drilling, testing and production reveal different results. Furthermore, some of the producing wells included in our reserve report have produced for a relatively short period of time. Accordingly, some of our reserve estimates are not based on a multi-year production decline curve and are calculated using a reservoir simulation model together with volumetric analysis. Any downward adjustment could indicate lower future production and thus adversely affect our financial condition, future prospects and market value.. Approximately 35% of our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2017 were proved undeveloped reserves. The development of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The reserve data included in the reserve engineer reports assumes that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves. Although cost and reserve estimates attributable to our crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves have been prepared in accordance with industry standards, we cannot be sure that the. 21. Table of Contents. estimated costs are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves, or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the PV-10 value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could cause us to have to reclassify our proved undeveloped reserves as unproved reserves.. The present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves.. You should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves referred to in this report is the current market value of our estimated crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves. In accordance with the requirements of the SEC, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves are based on prices and costs on the date of the estimate, held flat for the life of the properties. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate. The present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 was based on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the period January through December 2017. For our condensate and natural gas liquids, the average West Texas Intermediate (Cushing) posted price was $51.34 per barrel for offshore and onshore Southern Delaware Basin volumes, as prepared by Cobb, and the average West Texas Intermediate (Plains) posted price was $47.79 per barrel for all other onshore volumes, as prepared by NSAI. For our natural gas, the average Henry Hub spot price was $2.98 per MMBtu for all offshore and onshore volumes, as prepared by both Cobb and NSAI. Assuming strip pricing as of March 1, 2018 through 2022 and keeping pricing flat thereafter, instead of 2017 SEC pricing, while leaving all other parameters unchanged, the Company's proved reserves would have been 188.6 Bcfe and the PV-10 value of proved reserves would have been $258.3 million. Any adjustments to the estimates of proved reserves or decreases in the price of crude oil or natural gas may decrease the value of our common stock. A reconciliation of our Standardized Measure to PV - 10 is provided under \"Item 2. Properties  -  PV-10\".. Actual future net cash flows will also be affected by increases or decreases in consumption by oil and gas purchasers and changes in governmental regulations or taxation. The timing of both the production and the incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and gas properties affects the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves. The effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with our business or the oil and gas industry in general will affect the accuracy of the 10% discount factor.. Our use of 2D and 3D seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. In addition, the use of such technology requires greater predrilling expenditures, which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations.. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop and exploit prospects or properties depend in part on data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are uncertain. For example, we have over 4,000 square miles of 3D data in the South Texas and Gulf Coast regions. However, even when used and properly interpreted, 3D seismic data and visualization techniques only assist geoscientists and geologists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators. They do not allow the interpreter to know if hydrocarbons are present or producible economically. Other geologists and petroleum professionals, when studying the same seismic data, may have significantly different interpretations than our professionals.. In addition, the use of 3D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur losses due to such expenditures. As a result, our drilling activities may not be geologically successful or economical, and our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activities in a particular area may not improve.. Drilling for and producing crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.. Our drilling and operating activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that we will not discover commercially productive reservoirs. Drilling for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids can be unprofitable, not only from dry holes, but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit. In addition, our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of other factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunusual or unexpected geological formations and miscalculations;. 22. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpressures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfires;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texplosions and blowouts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpipe or cement failures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil and produced water spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials, and unauthorized discharges of toxic gases, brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of drilling fluid circulation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttitle problems;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfacility or equipment malfunctions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunexpected operational events;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshortages of skilled personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshortages or delivery delays of equipment and services or of water used in hydraulic fracturing activities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompliance with environmental and other regulatory requirements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstockholder activism and activities by non-governmental organizations to limit certain sources of funding for the energy sector or restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas so as to minimize emissions of GHGs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnatural disasters; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse weather conditions.. Any of these risks can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life; severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution, environmental contamination, clean-up responsibilities, loss of wells, repairs to resume operations; and regulatory fines or penalties.. Insurance against all operational risks is not available to us. Additionally, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the perceived risks presented. We carry limited environmental insurance, thus, losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. The occurrence of an event that is not covered in full or in part by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our business activities, financial condition and results of operations.. The potential lack of availability of, or cost of, drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and crude oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute on a timely basis our exploration and development plans within our budget.. When the prices of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids increase, or the demand for equipment and services is greater than the supply in certain areas, such as the Southern Delaware Basin, we typically encounter an increase in the cost of securing drilling rigs, equipment and supplies. In addition, larger producers may be more likely to secure access to such equipment by offering more lucrative terms. If we are unable to acquire access to such resources, or can obtain access only at higher prices, our ability to convert our reserves into cash flow could be delayed and the cost of producing those reserves could increase significantly, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.. 23. Table of Contents. The natural gas and oil business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover some liabilities or losses that we may incur.. The natural gas and oil business involves a variety of operating risks, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tBlowouts, fires and explosions..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSurface cratering..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tUncontrollable flows of underground natural gas, oil or formation water..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tNatural disasters..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPipe and cement failures..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCasing collapses..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tStuck drilling and service tools..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tReservoir compaction..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAbnormal pressure formations..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tEnvironmental hazards such as natural gas leaks, oil and produced water spills, pipeline and tank ruptures or unauthorized discharges of brine, toxic gases, well stimulation and completion fluids, or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCapacity constraints, equipment malfunctions and other problems at third-party operated platforms, pipelines and gas processing plants over which we have no control..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRepeated shut-ins of our well bores could significantly damage our well bores..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRequired workovers of existing wells that may not be successful.. If any of the above events occur, we could incur substantial losses as a result of:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tInjury or loss of life..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tReservoir damage..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSevere damage to and destruction of property or equipment..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPollution and other environmental and natural resources damage..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRestoration, decommissioning or clean-up responsibilities..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRegulatory investigations and penalties..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSuspension of our operations or repairs necessary to resume operations.. Offshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks peculiar to the marine environment, such as capsizing and collisions. In addition, offshore operations, and in some instances operations along the Gulf Coast, are subject to damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. For example, our total production for the year ended December 31, 2017 declined by 0.4 Mmcfe/d as a result of downtime associated with the impact of Hurricane Harvey. These conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production. As a result, we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce the funds available for exploration, development or leasehold acquisitions, or result in loss of properties.. If we were to experience any of these problems, it could affect well bores, platforms, gathering systems and processing facilities, any one of which could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations. In accordance with. 24. Table of Contents. customary industry practices, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks. Losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. We may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable, and particular types of coverage may not be available. An event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.. Our hedging activities could result in financial losses or reduce our income.. To achieve a more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well as interest rates, we have, and may in the future, enter into derivative arrangements for a portion of our crude oil, natural gas and/or natural gas liquids production and our debt that could result in both realized and unrealized hedging losses. We typically utilize financial instruments to hedge commodity price exposure to declining prices on our crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production. We typically use a combination of puts, swaps and costless collars.. Our production may be significantly higher or lower than we estimate at the time we enter into hedging transactions for such period. If the actual amount is higher than we estimate, we will have greater commodity price exposure than we intended. If the actual amount is lower than the nominal amount that is subject to our derivative financial instruments, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative transactions without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale or purchase of the underlying physical commodity, resulting in a substantial diminution of our liquidity. As a result of these factors, our hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of our cash flows.. The enactment of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate, and other risks associated with our business.. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) enacted in 2010, established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. Although the CFTC has finalized certain regulations, others remain to be finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished.. In October 2011, the CFTC issued regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. The initial position-limits rule was vacated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2012. In November 2013, the CFTC proposed new rules that would place limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions, but the rule was not adopted. In December 2016, the CFTC proposed a new version of the rule, with respect to which the comment period has closed but a final rule has not been issued. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time.. The CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and the associated rules also will require us, in connection with covered derivative activities, to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements or take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. In addition the CFTC and certain banking regulators have recently adopted final rules establishing minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps. Although we currently qualify for the end-user exception to the mandatory clearing, trade-execution and margin requirements for swaps entered to hedge our commercial risks, the application of such requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. In addition, if any of our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, posting of collateral could impact liquidity and reduce cash available to us for capital expenditures, therefore reducing our ability to execute hedges to reduce risk and protect cash flows.. The full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory requirements upon our business will not be known until the regulations are implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. The Dodd-Frank Act and regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts or increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce. 25. Table of Contents. our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors.. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material, adverse effect on us, our financial condition, and our results of operations.. If prices remain at current levels or decline further, we will likely incur further impairment of proved properties.. If management's estimates of the recoverable proved reserves on a property are revised downward or if oil and/or natural gas prices decline further in 2018, we may be required to record further non-cash impairment write-downs in the future, which would result in a negative impact to our financial results. Furthermore, any sustained decline in oil and/or natural gas prices may require us to make further impairments. We review our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a depletable unit basis when circumstances suggest there is a need for such a review. To determine if a depletable unit is impaired, we compare the carrying value of the depletable unit to the undiscounted future net cash flows by applying management's estimates of future oil and natural gas prices to the estimated future production of oil and gas reserves over the economic life of the property. Future net cash flows are based upon our independent reservoir engineers' estimates of proved reserves. In addition, other factors such as probable and possible reserves are taken into consideration when justified by economic conditions. For each property determined to be impaired, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the property on a depletable unit basis.. Fair value is estimated to be the present value of expected future net cash flows. Any impairment charge incurred is recorded in accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization to reduce our recorded cost basis in the asset. Each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of judgment, including the determination of the depletable units' estimated reserves, future cash flows and fair value.. Management's assumptions used in calculating oil and gas reserves or regarding the future cash flows or fair value of our properties are subject to change in the future. Any change could cause impairment expense to be recorded, impacting our net income or loss and our basis in the related asset. Any change in reserves directly impacts our estimate of future cash flows from the property, as well as the property's fair value. Additionally, as management's views related to future prices change, the change will affect the estimate of future net cash flows and the fair value estimates. Changes in either of these amounts will directly impact the calculation of impairment.. Production activities in the Gulf of Mexico increase our susceptibility to pollution and natural resource damage.. A blowout, rupture or spill of any magnitude would present serious operational and financial challenges. All of the Company's operations in the Gulf of Mexico shelf are in water depths of less than 300 feet and less than 50 miles from the coast. Such proximity to the shore-line increases the probability of a biological impact or damaging the fragile eco-system in the event of released condensate.. Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.. Climate change continues to attract considerable public, governmental and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and may continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs. While no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date at the federal level, the EPA and states and groupings of states have considered or pursued cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources.  In particular, the EPA adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\"PSD\") construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet \"best available control technology\" standards that typically will be established by the states. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among others, certain oil and natural gas production facilities, which includes certain of our operations.. 26. Table of Contents. Federal agencies also have begun directly regulating emissions of methane, a GHG, from oil and natural gas operations. In June 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing New Source Performance Standards (\"NSPS\") Subpart OOOOa standards that require certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce these methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions. These Subpart OOOOa standards will expand the previously issued NSPS Subpart OOOO requirements issued in 2012 by using certain equipment-specific emissions control practices. However, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay certain portions of the June 2016 standards for two years and re-evaluate the entirety of the 2016 standards, but the EPA has not yet published a final rule and, as a result, the June 2016 rule remains in effect. Future implementation of the 2016 standards is uncertain at this time. In another example, the BLM published a final rule in November 2016 that imposes requirements to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaking on federal and Indian lands. However, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule that temporarily suspends or delays certain requirements contained in the November 2016 final rule until January 17, 2019. The suspension of the November 2016 final rule is being challenged in court. These rules, should they remain in effect, and any other new methane emission standards imposed on the oil and gas sector could result in increased costs to our or our customers' operations as well as result in delays or curtailment in such operations, which costs, delays or curtailment could adversely affect our business. Moreover, in December 2015, the United States joined other countries of the United Nations in preparing an agreement requiring member countries to review and establish goals for limiting GHG emissions. This \"Paris Agreement\" was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force in November 2016; however, this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions but, rather, includes pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. However, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States' adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may re-enter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future international, federal or state laws or regulations that impose reporting obligations on us with respect to, or require the elimination of GHG emissions from, our equipment or operations could require us to incur increased operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce.  Moreover, such new legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost to the consumer, which could reduce the demand for the oil and natural gas we produce and lower the value of our reserves.. Recently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production or midstream activities. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will continue to rise and will not peak until after 2040 and that oil and natural gas will continue to represent a substantial percentage of global energy use over that time.  Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, we have not developed a comprehensive plan to address the legal, economic, social or physical impacts of climate change on our operations.. Should we fail to comply with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders of the FERC, the CFTC, or the FTC, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the FERC's jurisdiction. We believe that the gas gathering facilities we own meet the traditional tests the FERC has used to establish a pipeline system's status as a non-jurisdictional gatherer. There is, however, no bright-line test for determining the jurisdictional status of pipeline facilities. Moreover, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of litigation from time to time, so the classification and regulation of some of our gathering facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC and the courts. Our failure to comply with this or other laws and regulations administered by the FERC could subject us to substantial penalties, as described in Part I, Item 1: \"Business - Governmental Regulations and Industry Matters.\". Under the 2005 Act and implementing regulations, the FERC prohibits market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas. The CFTC has similar authority under the Commodity Exchange Act and regulations. 27. Table of Contents. it has promulgated thereunder with respect to certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities market including oil and natural gas. The FTC also prohibits manipulative or fraudulent conduct in the wholesale petroleum market with respect to sales of commodities, including crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. These agencies have substantial enforcement authority, including the potential ability to impose maximum penalties for violations in excess of $1 million per day for each violation. Following their adoption, the maximum penalties prescribed by these regulations have been subject to annual adjustment for inflation. The FERC has also imposed requirements related to reporting of natural gas sales volumes that may impact the formation of prices indices. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these and other matters may be considered or adopted from time to time. Our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations administered by these agencies could subject us to substantial penalties, as described in Part I, Item 1: \"Business - Governmental Regulations and Industry Matters.\". Our ability to market our natural gas and oil may be impaired by capacity constraints and equipment malfunctions on the platforms, gathering systems, pipelines and gas plants that transport and process our natural gas and oil.. All of our natural gas and oil is transported through gathering systems, pipelines and processing plants. Transportation capacity on gathering system pipelines and platforms is occasionally limited and at times unavailable due to repairs or improvements being made to these facilities or due to capacity being utilized by other natural gas or oil shippers that may have priority transportation agreements. If the gathering systems, processing plants, platforms or our transportation capacity is materially restricted or is unavailable in the future, our ability to market our natural gas or oil could be impaired and cash flow from the affected properties could be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, repeated shut-ins of our wells could result in damage to our well bores that would impair our ability to produce from these wells and could result in additional wells being required to produce our reserves.. If our access to sales markets is restricted, it could negatively impact our production, our income and ultimately our ability to retain our leases.. Market conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids transportation arrangements may hinder our access to crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. Our productive properties may be located in areas with limited or no access to pipelines, thereby necessitating delivery by other means, such as trucking, or requiring compression facilities. Such restrictions on our ability to sell our crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids may have several adverse effects, including higher transportation costs, fewer potential purchasers (thereby potentially resulting in a lower selling price) or, in the event we were unable to market and sustain production from a particular lease for an extended time, possible loss of a lease due to lack of production.. We may not have title to our leased interests and if any lease is later rendered invalid, we may not be able to proceed with our exploration and development of the lease site.. Our practice in acquiring exploration leases or undivided interests in natural gas and oil leases is to not incur the expense of retaining title lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest prior to executing the lease. Instead, we rely upon the judgment of consultants and others to perform the field work in examining records in the appropriate governmental, county or parish clerk's office before leasing a specific mineral interest. This practice is widely followed in the industry. Prior to the drilling of an exploration well the operator of the well will typically obtain a preliminary title review of the drill site lease and/or spacing unit within which the proposed well is to be drilled to identify any obvious deficiencies in title to the well and, if there are deficiencies, to identify measures necessary to cure those defects to the extent reasonably possible. However, such deficiencies may not have been cured by the operator of such wells. It does happen, from time to time, that the examination made by title lawyers reveals that the lease or leases are invalid, having been purchased in error from a person who is not the rightful owner of the mineral interest desired. In these circumstances, we may not be able to proceed with our exploration and development of the lease site or may incur costs to remedy a defect. It may also happen, from time to time, that the operator may elect to proceed with a well despite defects to the title identified in the preliminary title opinion.. 28. Table of Contents. Competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense, and we are smaller and have a more limited operating history than many of our competitors.. We compete with a broad range of natural gas and oil companies in our exploration and property acquisition activities. We also compete for the equipment and labor required to operate and to develop these properties. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do. These competitors may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive natural gas and oil properties. Further, they may be able to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can. Our ability to explore for natural gas and oil and to acquire additional properties in the future depends on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment. In addition, many of our competitors have been operating for a much longer time than we have and have substantially larger staffs. We may not be able to compete effectively with these companies or in such a highly competitive environment.. Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated or significantly changed as a result of future legislation.. Recently enacted legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, made significant changes to U.S. tax laws. While past legislative proposals have included changes to certain key U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available to oil and gas companies, including (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures, these specific changes were not included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. No accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future or, if enacted, what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be. However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (i) eliminates the deduction for certain domestic production activities, (ii) imposes new limitations on the utilization of net operating losses, and (iii) provides for more general changes to the taxation of corporations, including changes to cost recovery rules and to the deductibility of interest expense, which may impact the taxation of oil and gas companies.  Future changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that currently are available with respect to oil and gas development, or increase costs, and any such changes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. We are subject to stringent laws and regulations, including environmental requirements that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.. Our oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing the operation and maintenance of our facilities, the discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection. Failure to comply with such rules and regulations could result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations, the occurrence of delays or restrictions in permitting or performance of projects and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations in affected areas. These laws and regulations may:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequire that we obtain permits before commencing drilling or other regulated activities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrict the substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimit or prohibit drilling activities on protected areas, such as wetlands or wilderness areas;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequire remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timpose substantial penalties for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations.. Under these laws and regulations, we could be liable for personal injury and clean-up costs and other environmental natural resource and property damages. We maintain insurance coverage for sudden and accidental environmental damages; however, it is possible that coverage might not be sufficient in a catastrophic event. Accordingly, we may be subject to liability, or we may be required to cease production from properties in the event of environmental damages. The trend in environmental laws and regulations is to place more stringent restrictions and. 29. Table of Contents. limitations on activities that may affect the environment.  For example, in October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion for the 8-hour primary and secondary ozone standards. The EPA published a final rule in November 2017 that issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone for approximately 85% of the U.S. counties as either \"attainment/unclassifiable\" or \"unclassifiable\" but had not yet issued non-attainment designations for the remaining areas of the U.S. not addressed in the November 2017 final rule. States are also expected to implement requirements as a result of this NAAQs final rule, which could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. Compliance with this final rule could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital or operating expenditures. In another example, in June 2015, the EPA and the Corps published a final rule attempting to clarify the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States including wetlands, but legal challenges to this rule followed. The 2015 rule was stayed nationwide to determine whether federal district or appellate courts had jurisdiction to hear cases in the matter and, in January 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. The EPA and Corps proposed a rulemaking in June 2017 to repeal the June 2015 rule, announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the Clean Water Act's jurisdiction, and published a proposed rule in November 2017 specifying that the contested June 2015 rule would not take effect until two years after the November 2017 proposed rule was finalized and published in the Federal Register. Recently, on January 22, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision finding that jurisdiction resides with the federal district courts; consequently, while implementation of the 2015 rule currently remains stayed, the previously-filed district court cases will be allowed to proceed. As a result of these recent developments, future implementation of the June 2015 rule is uncertain at this time but to the extent any rule expands the scope of the Clean Water Act's jurisdiction, drilling programs could incur increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, we can provide no assurance that our future compliance with existing laws and regulations, these recently adopted rulemakings, or any new or amended legal requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. An accidental release of pollutants into the environment may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities.. We may incur significant environmental costs liabilities in our business as a result of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, because of air emissions and waste water discharges related to our operations, and due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices.  We currently own, operate or lease numerous properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas.  Many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes was not under our control. For example, an accidental release resulting from the drilling of a well, could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup, restoration costs and natural resource damages, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property and natural resource damages as well as monetary fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. Moreover, certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for these costs and liabilities without regard to fault or the legality of our conduct.  Under these environmental laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination) or to perform remedial plugging or other decommissioning activities to prevent future contamination.  We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.. Federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing, as well as governmental reviews of such activities, could result in increased costs, additional operating restrictions or delays, and adversely affect our production.. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or crude oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand or other proppant and chemical additives under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We routinely use hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion programs. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, or similar state agencies, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority or pursued investigations over certain aspects of the process. For example, in February 2014, the EPA asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA Underground Injection Control program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities. The EPA also published final rules under the CAA in 2012 and in June 2016 governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during oil and natural gas. 30. Table of Contents. hydraulic fracturing. Additionally, in June 2016, the EPA published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants and, in May 2014, published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. The BLM published a final rule in March 2015 that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands. However, in June 2016, a Wyoming federal judge struck down this final rule, finding that the BLM lacked authority to promulgate the rule, the BLM appealed the decision to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in July 2016, the appellate court issued a ruling in September 2017 to vacate the Wyoming trial court decision and dismiss the lawsuit challenging the 2015 rule in response to the BLM's issuance of a proposed rulemaking to rescind the 2015 rule and, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule rescinding the March 2015 rule. In January 2018, litigation challenging the BLM's rescission of the 2015 rule was brought in federal court. Also, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that \"water cycle\" activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances, including as a result of water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability or due to surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water.. Moreover, from time to time, Congress has considered, but not enacted, legislation intended to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. In addition, certain states, including Texas and Wyoming, where we conduct operations, have adopted and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose new or more stringent permitting, public disclosure, and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach of the State of New York in 2015. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place or manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. In the event that new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we currently or in the future plan to operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.. We may be subject to additional supplemental bonding under the BOEM financial assurance requirements.. Energy companies conducting oil and natural gas lease operations offshore on the OCS are required by the BOEM, among other obligations, to conduct decommissioning within specified times following cessation of offshore producing activities, which decommissioning includes the plugging of wells, removal of platforms and other facilities, and the clearing of obstacles from the lease site sea floor.  To cover a lease operator's decommissioning obligations, the BOEM generally requires that lessees demonstrate financial strength and reliability according to regulations or otherwise post bonds or other acceptable financial assurances that such future obligations will be satisfied.  As an operator, we are required to post surety bonds of $200,000 per lease for exploration and $500,000 per lease for developmental activities as part of our general bonding requirements, as well as the posting of additional supplemental bonds to cover, among other things, our decommissioning obligations.  We typically post surety bonds with the BOEM to satisfy our general and supplemental bonding requirements.. The BOEM continues to consider the adoption or enforcement of more stringent financial assurance regulatory initiatives that could result in additional costs, delays, restrictions, or obligations with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production operations conducted offshore on the federal OCS. In particular, the BOEM issued an updated NTL #2016-N01 that became effective in September 2016 and bolsters the financial assurance requirements offshore lessees on the OCS, including the Gulf of Mexico, must satisfy with respect to their decommissioning liabilities. If the BOEM determines under NTL #2016-N01 that a company does not satisfy the minimum requirements to qualify for providing self-insurance to meet its decommissioning and other obligations, that company will be required to post additional financial security as assurance. During 2017, however, with the issuance of Order 3350, the BSEE and the BOEM have been directed to reconsider a number of regulatory initiatives governing offshore oil and gas safety and performance-related activities, including, for example, NTL #2016-N01, and provide recommendations on whether such regulatory initiatives should continue to be implemented. Consequently, during 2017, the BOEM extended the start date for implementing NTL #2016-N01 indefinitely beyond June 30, 2017. This extension currently remains in effect; however, the BOEM reserved the right to re-issue sole liability orders in the future, including in the event that it determines there is a substantial risk of nonperformance of the interest holder's decommissioning sole liabilities. Following completion of its review, the BOEM may elect to retain NTL #2016-N01 in its current form or may make revisions thereto and, thus, until the review is completed and the BOEM determines what additional financial assurance. 31. Table of Contents. may be required by us, we cannot provide assurance that such financial assurance coverage can be obtained. Moreover, the BOEM could in the future make other demands for additional financial assurances covering our obligations under sole liability properties and/or non-sole liability properties.. If we fail to comply with the current or future orders of the BOEM to provide additional surety bonds or other financial assurances, the BOEM could commence enforcement proceedings or take other remedial action, including assessing civil penalties, ordering suspension of operations or production, or initiating procedures to cancel leases, which, if upheld, would have a material adverse effect on our business, properties, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, under existing BOEM rules relating to assignment of offshore leases and other legal interests on the OCS, assignors of such interest may be held jointly and severally liable for decommissioning obligations at those OCS facilities existing at the time the assignment was approved by the BOEM, in the event that the assignee is unable or unwilling to conduct required decommissioning. In the event that we, in the role of assignor, receive orders from the BOEM to decommission OCS facilities that one of our assignees of offshore facilities is unwilling or unable to perform, we could incur costs to perform those decommissioning obligations, which costs could be material.. The BSEE has implemented much more stringent controls and reporting requirements that if not followed, could result in significant monetary penalties or a shut-in of all or a portion of our Gulf of Mexico operations.. The BSEE is the federal agency responsible for overseeing the safe and environmentally responsible development of energy and mineral resources on the OCS. The agency is responsible for leading the most aggressive and comprehensive reforms to offshore oil and natural gas regulation and oversight in U.S. history. Their reforms have tightened requirements for everything from well and blowout preventer design and workplace safety to corporate accountability. However, as a result of the issuance of Order 3350 during 2017, the BSEE is reconsidering a number of regulatory initiatives governing offshore oil and gas safety and performance-related activities. For example, on December 29, 2017, the BSEE published proposed revisions to its regulations regarding offshore drilling safety equipment, which proposal includes the removal of the requirement for offshore operators to certify through an independent third party that their critical safety and pollution prevention equipment (e.g., subsea safety equipment, including blowout preventers) is operational and functioning as designed in the most extreme conditions.  The December 2017 proposed rule has not been finalized and there remains substantial uncertainty as to the scope and extent of any revisions to existing oil and gas safety and performance-related regulations and other regulatory initiatives that ultimately will be adopted by the BSEE pursuant to the agency's review process.. Additionally, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act authorizes and requires the BSEE to provide for both an annual scheduled inspection and a periodic unscheduled (unannounced) inspection of all oil and natural gas operations on the OCS. In addition to examining all safety equipment designed to prevent blowouts, fires, spills, or other major accidents, the inspections focus on pollution, drilling operations, completions, workovers, production, and pipeline safety. Upon detecting a violation, the inspector issues an Incident of Noncompliance (\"INC\") to the operator and uses one of two main enforcement actions (warning or shut-in), depending on the severity of the violation. If the violation is not severe or threatening, a warning INC is issued. The warning INC must be corrected within a reasonable amount of time specified on the INC. The shut-in INC may be for a single component (a portion of the facility) or the entire facility. The violation must be corrected before the operator is allowed to resume the activity in question.. In addition to the enforcement actions specified above, the BSEE can assess civil penalties if: (i) the operator fails to correct the violation in the reasonable amount of time specified on the INC; or (ii) the violation resulted in a threat of serious harm or damage to human life or the environment. In January 2018, the BSEE published a final rule that increased the maximum civil penalty rate for Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act violations to $43,576 a day for each violation. Operators with excessive INCs may be required to cease operations in the Gulf of Mexico.. We are highly dependent on our senior management team, our exploration partners, third-party consultants and engineers, and other key personnel and any failure to retain the services of such parties could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our overall operations or successfully execute current or future business strategies.. The successful implementation of our business strategy and handling of other issues integral to the fulfillment of our business strategy is highly dependent on our management team, as well as certain key geoscientists, geologists, engineers and other professionals engaged by us. The loss of key members of our management team or other highly qualified technical professionals could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our overall operations or successfully execute current or future business strategies which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our ability to manage our growth, if any, will require us to continue to train,. 32. Table of Contents. motivate and manage our employees and to attract, motivate and retain additional qualified personnel. Competition for these types of personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting, assimilating and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably.. Acquisition prospects are difficult to assess and may pose additional risks to our operations.. We expect to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue acquisition opportunities on terms our management considers favorable. The successful acquisition of natural gas and oil properties requires an assessment of:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRecoverable reserves..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tExploration potential..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFuture natural gas and oil prices..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOperating costs..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPotential environmental and other liabilities and other factors..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPermitting and other authorizations, including environmental permits and authorizations, required for our operations.. In connection with such an assessment, we would expect to perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Nonetheless, the resulting conclusions are necessarily inexact and their accuracy inherently uncertain and such an assessment may not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it necessarily permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their merits and deficiencies. Inspections may not always be performed on every platform or well, and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Future acquisitions could pose additional risks to our operations and financial results, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tProblems integrating the purchased operations, personnel or technologies..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tUnanticipated costs..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDiversion of resources and management attention from our exploration business..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tEntry into regions or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPotential loss of key employees of the acquired organization.. We may be unable to successfully integrate the properties and assets we acquire with our existing operations.. Integration of the properties and assets we acquire may be a complex, time consuming and costly process. Failure to timely and successfully integrate these assets and properties with our operations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and result of operations. The difficulties of integrating these assets and properties present numerous risks, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAcquisitions may prove unprofitable and fail to generate anticipated cash flows..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe may need to (i) recruit additional personnel and we cannot be certain that any of our recruiting efforts will succeed and (ii) expand corporate infrastructure to facilitate the integration of our operations with those associated with the acquired properties, and failure to do so may lead to disruptions in our ongoing businesses or distract our management..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur management's attention may be diverted from other business concerns.. We are also exposed to risks that are commonly associated with acquisitions of this type, such as unanticipated liabilities and costs, some of which may be material. As a result, the anticipated benefits of acquiring assets and properties may not be fully realized, if at all.. 33. Table of Contents. When we acquire properties, in most cases, we are not entitled to contractual indemnification for pre-closing liabilities, including environmental liabilities.. We generally acquire interests in properties on an \"as is\" basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties, and in these situations we cannot assure you that we will identify all areas of existing or potential exposure. In those circumstances in which we have contractual indemnification rights for pre-closing liabilities, we cannot assure you that the seller will be able to fulfill its contractual obligations. In addition, the competition to acquire producing crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids properties is intense and many of our larger competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours. We cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire producing crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids properties that have economically recoverable reserves for acceptable prices.. In connection with the Acquisition, we entered into a new area of exploration and development in which we have limited experience and facilities, and as a result we may experience inefficiencies, incur unanticipated or higher costs and expenses, or may not fully realize the benefits anticipated as a result of the Acquisition.. We have a limited operating history in West Texas. As a result of the Acquisition, we will need to continue to integrate the properties and operations relating thereto with our current oil and gas operations, which may increase the risk of inefficiencies in timing, coordination and staffing, unanticipated higher costs and expenses than we currently have projected or drilling results below our expectations. As a result, any desired benefits of the Acquisition may not be fully realized, if at all, and our future financial performance and results of operations could be negatively impacted.. Increases in interest rates could adversely impact our business, share price and our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions, capital expenditures or other purposes.. Interest rates may increase in the future. As a result, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. Rising interest rates could reduce the amount of cash we generate and materially adversely affect our liquidity. Moreover, the trading price of our common stock is sensitive to changes in interest rates and could be materially adversely affected by any increase in interest rates.. Assuming an outstanding balance on our credit facility of $85.4 million, an increase of one percentage point in the interest rates would have resulted in an increase in interest expense during 2017 of $0.9 million. Accordingly, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by significant increases in interest rates.. Cybersecurity breaches and information technology failures could harm our business by increasing our costs and negatively impacting our operations.. We rely extensively on information technology systems, including Internet sites, computer software, data hosting facilities and other hardware and platforms, some of which are hosted by third parties, to assist in conducting our business. Our information technology systems, as well as those of third parties we use in our operations, may be vulnerable to a variety of evolving cybersecurity risks, such as those involving unauthorized access, malicious software, data privacy breaches by employees or others with authorized access, cyber or phishing-attacks, ransomware and other security issues.. Although we have implemented information technology controls and systems that are designed to protect information and mitigate the risk of data loss and other cybersecurity risks, such measures cannot entirely eliminate cybersecurity threats, and the enhanced controls we have installed may be breached. If our information technology systems cease to function properly or our cybersecurity is breached, we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations which may include drilling, completion, production and corporate functions. A cyber attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business associates, could negatively impact our operations in a variety of ways, including but not limited to, the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tUnauthorized access to seismic data, reserves information, strategic information, or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for oil and gas resources;. 34. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tData corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruption during drilling activities could result in failure to reach the intended target or a drilling incident;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tData corruption or operational disruptions of production-related infrastructure could result in a loss of production, or accidental discharge;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tA cyber attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt our major development projects;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tA cyber attack on third party gathering, pipeline, or rail transportation systems could delay or prevent us from transporting and marketing our production, resulting in a loss of revenues;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tA cyber attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading, thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities, resulting in a loss of revenues;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tA cyber attack which halts activities at a power generation facility or refinery using natural gas as feed stock could have a significant impact on the natural gas market, resulting in reduced demand for our production, lower natural gas prices, and reduced revenues;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tA cyber attack on a communications network or power grid could cause operational disruption resulting in loss of revenues;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tA deliberate corruption of our financial or operating data could result in events of non-compliance which could then lead to regulatory fines or penalties; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tA cyber attack resulting in the loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our or any of our customer's or supplier's data or confidential information could harm our business by damaging our reputation, subjecting us to potential financial or legal liability, and requiring us to incur significant costs, including costs to repair or restore our systems and data or to take other remedial steps.. All of the above could negatively impact our operational and financial results. Additionally, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.. RISK FACTORS RELATED TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK. The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.. Volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your common stock at or above the price you paid for your common stock. The market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour operating and financial performance and prospects;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconditions that impact demand for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, domestically and globally;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfuture announcements concerning our business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactions of competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmarket and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;. 35. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in government and environmental regulation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral market, economic and political conditions, domestically and globally;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsales of common stock by us, our significant stockholders or members of our management team; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnatural disasters, terrorist attacks and acts of war.. Average natural gas and crude oil prices declined dramatically beginning in early 2015 and have remained relatively low since then. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This decline in commodity prices and stock market volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company, and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price.. We have no plans to pay regular dividends on our common stock, so you may not receive funds without selling your common stock.. Our board of directors presently intends to retain all of our earnings for the expansion of our business; therefore, we have no plans to pay regular dividends on our common stock. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends, and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. Also, the provisions of our senior secured revolving credit agreement and second lien credit agreement restrict the payment of dividends. Accordingly, you may have to sell some or all of your common stock in order to generate cash flow from your investment.. We may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.. Our board of directors is authorized, without further stockholder action, to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to designate the dividend rate, voting rights and other rights, preferences and restrictions of each such series. We are authorized to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.. Future sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of shares of our common stock.. Future sales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.. We may issue shares of our common stock or other securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments. If any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares of our common stock, or the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of other securities that we may issue may in turn be substantial. We may also grant registration rights covering those shares of our common stock or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments.. As of December 31, 2017, we had 94,833 stock options outstanding to purchase shares of our common stock outstanding, all of which were fully vested.. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares of our common stock issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.. 36. Table of Contents. Our organizational documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could deprive our investors of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares.. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for, or prevent a third party from, acquiring control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpermit us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, shares of preferred stock in one or more series and, with respect to each such series, to fix the number of shares constituting the series and the designation of the series, the voting powers (if any) of the shares of the series, and the preferences and relative, participating, optional, and other special rights, if any, and any qualification, limitations or restrictions of the shares of such series;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequire special meetings of the stockholders to be called by the Chairman of the board of directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, or by resolution of a majority of the board of directors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequire business at special meetings to be limited to the stated purpose or purposes of that meeting;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequire that stockholder action be taken at a meeting rather than by written consent, unless approved by our board of directors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequire that stockholders follow certain procedures, including advance notice procedures, to bring certain matters before an annual meeting or to nominate a director for election; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpermit directors to fill vacancies in our board of directors.. We are subject to the Delaware business combination law.. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a \"business combination\" with an \"interested stockholder\" for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.. Section 203 defines a \"business combination\" as a merger, asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholders. Section 203 defines an \"interested stockholder\" as a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or, in some cases, within three years prior, did own, 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock. Under Section 203, a business combination between us and an interested stockholder is prohibited unless:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholders becoming an interested stockholder prior to the date the person attained the status;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tupon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding, for purposes of determining the number of shares outstanding, shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers and issued employee stock plans, under which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held under the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe business combination is approved by our board of directors on or subsequent to the date the person became an interested stockholder and authorized at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.. This provision has an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of our common stock. With approval of our stockholders, we could amend our certificate of incorporation in the future to elect not to be governed by the anti-takeover law.. 37. Table of Contents. Our business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats and other disruptions.. As an oil and gas producer, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts.  The potential for such security threats has subjected our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business.  In particular, our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring.  If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data.  These events could lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability."
