[1] "ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS. There are many factors that could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution. New risks may emerge at any time, and the Partnership cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect financial performance. Each of the risks described below could adversely impact the value of the Partnership's common units.. Risks Inherent in Our Business. We may not have sufficient cash from operations following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of costs and expenses, including cost reimbursements to our General Partner and its affiliates, to enable us to pay quarterly distributions to our unitholders at our current distribution rate.. We may not have sufficient cash each quarter to enable us to pay quarterly distributions at our current distribution rate. The amount of cash we can distribute on our common and subordinated units principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which fluctuates from quarter to quarter based on the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe volume and quality of products that we are able to produce or source and sell, which could be adversely affected by, among other things, operating or technical difficulties at our plants or deep-water marine terminals;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe prices at which we are able to sell our products;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure of the Partnership's customers, vendors and shipping partners to pay or perform their contractual obligations to the Partnership;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe creditworthiness of our contract counterparties;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe amount of low - cost wood fiber that we are able to procure and process, which could be adversely affected by, among other things, operating or financial difficulties suffered by our suppliers;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the price and availability of natural gas, coal or other sources of energy;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in prevailing economic conditions;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour inability to complete acquisitions, including acquisitions from our sponsor, or to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinclement or hazardous environmental conditions, including extreme precipitation, temperatures and flooding;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfires, explosions or other accidents;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in domestic and foreign laws and regulations (or the interpretation thereof) related to renewable or low - carbon energy, the forestry products industry, the international shipping industry or power generators;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the regulatory treatment of biomass in core and emerging markets;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour inability to acquire or maintain necessary permits or rights for our production, transportation or terminaling operations;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the price and availability of transportation;. 19. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in foreign currency exchange or interest rates, and the failure of our hedging arrangements to effectively reduce our exposure to the risks related thereto;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trisks related to our indebtedness;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour failure to maintain effective quality control systems at our production plants and deep - water marine terminals, which could lead to the rejection of our products by our customers;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the quality specifications for our products that are required by our customers;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlabor disputes;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe effects of Brexit on our and our customers' businesses; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to borrow funds and access capital markets.. In addition, the actual amount of cash we have available for distribution depends on other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of capital expenditures we make;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcosts associated with construction projects at our existing facilities and future construction projects;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in our working capital needs;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour treatment as a pass - through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour debt service requirements and other liabilities;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions contained in our existing or future debt agreements; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe amount of cash reserves established by our General Partner.. The amount of cash we have available for distribution to holders of our units depends primarily on our cash flow and not solely on profitability, which may prevent us from making cash distributions during periods when we record net income.. The amount of cash we have available for distribution depends primarily upon our cash flow, including cash flow from reserves and working capital or other borrowings, and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non - cash items. As a result, we may pay cash distributions during periods when we record net losses for financial accounting purposes and may be unable to pay cash distributions during periods when we record net income.. Substantially all of our revenues currently are generated under contracts with four customers, and the loss of any of them could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make cash distributions. We may not be able to renew or obtain new and favorable contracts with these customers when our existing contracts expire, and we may not be able to obtain contracts with new customers, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.. Our contracts with Drax, Ørsted, Lynemouth Power and ENGIE will represent substantially all of our sales volumes in 2018. Because we have a small number of customers, we face counterparty concentration risk. The ability of each of our customers to perform its obligations under a contract with us will depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control and may include, among other things, the overall financial condition of the counterparty, the counterparty's access to capital, the condition of the regional and global power generation industry, continuing. 20. Table of Contents. regulatory and economic support for wood pellet - generated power, spot market pricing trends and general economic conditions. In addition, in depressed market conditions, our customers may no longer need the amount of our products they have contracted for or may be able to obtain comparable products at a lower price. If our customers experience a significant downturn in their business or financial condition, they may attempt to renegotiate, reject or declare force majeure under our contracts. Should any counterparty fail to honor its obligations under a contract with us, we could sustain losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution. We may also decide to renegotiate our existing contracts on less favorable terms and/or at reduced volumes in order to preserve our relationships with our customers.. Upon the expiration of our off - take contracts, our customers may decide not to recontract on terms as favorable to us as our current contracts, or at all. For example, our current customers may acquire wood pellets from other providers that offer more competitive pricing or logistics or develop their own sources of wood pellets. Some of our customers could also exit their current business or be acquired by other companies that purchase wood pellets from other providers. The demand for wood pellets or their prevailing prices at the times at which our current off - take contracts expire may also render entry into new long - term off - take contracts difficult or impossible.. Any reduction in the amount of wood pellets purchased by our customers, renegotiation of our contracts on less favorable terms, or our inability to enter into new contracts on economically acceptable terms upon the expiration of our current contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, as well as our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.. Termination penalties within our off - take contracts may not fully compensate us for our total economic losses.. Certain of our off - take contracts provide the customer with a right of termination for various events of convenience or changes in law or policy. Although some of these contracts are subject to certain protective termination payments, the termination payments made by our customers may not fully compensate us for losses resulting from a termination by such counterparty. In each case, we may be unable to re - contract our production at favorable prices or at all, and our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders may be materially adversely affected as a result.. We derive substantially all of our revenues from customers in Europe. If we fail to diversify our customer base geographically in the future, our results of operations, business and financial position and ability to make cash distributions could be materially adversely affected.. Substantially all of our revenues currently are derived from customers in Europe, and our revenues have been heavily dependent on developments in the European markets. If economic, political, regulatory or financial market conditions in Europe deteriorate, including as a result of weakness in European economies, our customers may respond by suspending, delaying or reducing their expenditures and may attempt to renegotiate, reject or declare force majeure under our contracts. Our failure to successfully penetrate markets outside of Europe in the future could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.. The actions of certain special interest groups could adversely impact our business.. Certain special interest groups that focus on environmental issues have expressed their opposition to the use of biomass for power generation, both publicly and directly to domestic and foreign regulators, policy makers, power generators and other industrial users of biomass. These groups are also actively lobbying, litigating and undertaking other actions domestically and abroad in an effort to increase the regulation of, reduce or eliminate the incentives and support for, or otherwise delay, interfere with or impede the production and use of biomass for power generation. Such efforts, if successful, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, business and financial condition, and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.. 21. Table of Contents. Our exposure to risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations, as well the hedging arrangements we may enter into to mitigate those risks, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. We may experience foreign currency exchange and interest rate volatility in operating our business. We began to use hedging transactions in 2016 with respect to certain of our off - take contracts which are, in part or in whole, denominated in British Pound Sterling (\"GBP\"), as well as an interest rate swap with respect to a portion of our variable rate debt, in an effort to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations. We currently do not hedge a significant portion of our overall revenue pursuant to our off - take contracts.. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could be material to us depending upon, among other things, the currency denominations of our off - take contracts. In particular, we will in the future have exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and the GBP as sales under the EVA - MGT Contract or the 95,000 MTPY contract with the First Hancock JV, which commence in 2019 and 2020, respectively, are denominated in GBP from 2020 onward and sales under the Lynemouth Power Contract, which commenced in 2017, are denominated in U.S. Dollars and GBP. Although the use of hedging transactions limits our downside risk, their use may also limit future revenues.. In addition, there may be instances in which costs and revenue will not be matched with respect to currency denomination. As a result, to the extent that existing and future off - take contracts are not denominated in U.S. Dollars, it is possible that increasing portions of revenue, costs, assets and liabilities will be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency valuations.. Our hedging transactions involve cost and risk and may not be effective at mitigating our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates. Risks inherent in our hedging transactions include the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts may be unable to perform their obligations and the risk that the terms of such instruments will not be legally enforceable. Likewise, our hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from foreign currency exchange or interest rates fluctuations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.. Challenges to or delays in the issuance of air permits could impair our ability to expand production.. Our pellet production facilities are subject to the requirements of the CAA and must either receive minor source permits from the states in which they are located or a major source permit, which is subject to the approval of the EPA. In general, our facilities are eligible for minor source permits following the application of pollution control technologies. However, should we be subject to any challenges to the issuance of our permits, we could experience substantial delays in the issuance of our permits, which could impair our ability to expand our production capacity. In addition, any new air permits we receive could require that we incur additional expenses to install emissions control technologies or limit operations to satisfy emission limitations.. Changes in laws or government policies, incentives and taxes implemented to support increased generation of or otherwise regulate low - carbon and renewable energy may affect customer demand for our products.. Consumers of utility - grade wood pellets currently use our products either as part of a binding obligation to generate a certain percentage of low - carbon energy or because they receive direct or indirect financial support or incentives to do so. Financial support is often necessary to cover the generally higher costs of wood pellets compared to conventional fossil fuels like coal. In most countries, once the government implements a tax (e.g., the United Kingdom's carbon price floor tax) or a preferable tariff or a specific renewable energy policy either supporting a renewable energy generator or the energy generating sector as a whole, such tax, tariff or policy is guaranteed for a specified period of time, sometimes for the investment lifetime of any electricity generator's project. However, governmental policies that. 22. Table of Contents. currently support the use of biomass may modify their tax, tariff or incentive regimes, and the future availability of such taxes, tariffs or policies, either in current jurisdictions beyond the prescribed timeframes or in new jurisdictions, is uncertain. Demand for wood pellets could be substantially lower than expected if government support is reduced or delayed or, in the future, is insufficient to enable successful deployment of biomass power to the levels currently projected. In addition, regulatory changes such as new requirements to install additional pollution control technology or curtail operations to meet new GHG emission limits may also affect demand for our products.. In Europe, the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive (\"RED\") requires that it fulfill 20% of its energy demand from renewable sources by 2020. Under the current RED framework, biofuels are subject to a set of sustainability criteria that must be met in order to qualify as renewable fuels. The European Union is currently in the process of finalizing a second Renewable Energy Directive (\"RED II\") that seeks to increase the renewable energy goal to 27% of energy demand by 2030. Under the RED II proposal, qualifying biofuels would be subject to new sustainability requirements, including a requirement that biofuel feedstocks be harvested from areas with increasing carbon stocks. The finalization of these requirements could cause us to incur additional compliance costs. Moreover, there can be no guarantee that the final version of RED II will be favorable to biomass producers in the United States. Finally, any actions the European Union takes to regulate biofuels may influence future regulatory actions in other countries where our customers are located. In the event that RED II limits or otherwise constrains our ability to export our product to the European Union or has other adverse consequences, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.. In the United States, on October 16, 2017, the EPA proposed a rule to repeal the Clean Power Plan (the \"CPP\"), the Obama Administration's rule establishing carbon pollution standards for existing power plants. Under the proposal, the CPP - which is currently subject to a judicial stay issued by the U.S. Supreme Court - would be repealed. The current repeal proposal suggests that the EPA has yet to determine when or whether it might promulgate new GHG emissions standards for existing power plants. At this time, it is not clear what impact the repeal of the CPP and any future rulemaking will have on the demand for biomass in the United States. Also, almost half of U.S. states, either individually or through multi - state regional initiatives, have begun to address GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap - and - trade programs. Although neither the U.S. Congress nor the states in which our facilities are located have adopted such legislation at this time, they may do so in the future. The adoption of a different approach to the treatment of biogenic carbon in the United States could be treated as precedential by European regulators and impact the regulatory treatment of our product in our primary markets.. Moreover, many nations have agreed to limit emissions of GHGs pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and more recently, in December 2015, 195 countries met in Paris, France to approve a landmark climate accord. On November 4, 2016, the Paris Agreement entered into force, potentially providing additional incentives for participating countries to reduce their GHG emissions. While the Trump Administration has signaled its intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, substantially all of our current customers are located in countries that have agreed to be bound by the Paris Agreement. Although it is not possible at this time to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws or implementing regulations could require us to incur increased operating or maintenance costs, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. The international nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks, including foreign exchange risk and unfavorable political, regulatory and tax conditions in foreign countries.. Substantially all of our current product sales are to customers that operate outside of the United States. As a result, we face certain risks inherent in maintaining international operations that include, but are not limited to, the following:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforeign exchange movements, which may make it more difficult for our customers to make payments denominated in U.S. Dollars or exert pricing pressure on new contracts compared to competitors that source in a weaker currency;. 23. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions on foreign trade and investment, including currency exchange controls imposed by or in other countries; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttrade barriers such as export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses, which could increase the prices of our products and make our products less competitive in some countries.. Our business in foreign countries requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries. Our overall success as a global business depends, in part, on our ability to succeed under differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to develop, implement and maintain policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where our customers operate. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.. Federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to forestry products and the potential for related litigation could result in increased costs, additional operating restrictions or delays for our suppliers and customers, respectively, which could cause a decline in the demand for our products and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Currently, our raw materials are byproducts of traditional timber harvesting, principally the tops and limbs of trees, as well as other low - value wood materials that are generated in a harvest and industrial residuals (chips, sawdust and other wood industry byproducts). Commercial forestry is regulated by complex regulatory frameworks at each of the federal, state and local levels. Among other federal laws, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act have been applied to commercial forestry operations through agency regulations and court decisions, as well as through the delegation to states to implement and monitor compliance with such laws. State forestry laws, as well as land-use regulations and zoning ordinances at the local level, are also used to manage forests in the Southeastern United States, as well as other regions from which we may need to source raw materials in the future. Any new or modified laws or regulations at any of these levels could have the effect of reducing forestry operations in areas where we procure our raw materials and consequently may prevent us from purchasing raw materials in an economic manner, or at all. In addition, future regulation of, or litigation concerning, the use of timberlands, the protection of endangered species, the promotion of forest biodiversity, and the response to and prevention of wildfires, as well as litigation, campaigns or other measures advanced by environmental activist groups, could also reduce the availability of the raw materials required for our operations.. The enactment of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of foreign currency, interest rate, and other risks associated with our business.. The Dodd - Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\"Dodd - Frank Act\") enacted on July 21, 2010, established federal oversight and regulation over the derivatives markets and entities, such as us, that participate in such markets. The Dodd - Frank Act requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (\"CFTC\") and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd - Frank Act. Although the CFTC has finalized certain regulations, others remain to be finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished.. The CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and the associated rules also require us, in connection with covered derivative activities, to comply with clearing and trade - execution requirements or take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. We do not utilize credit default swaps and we qualify for, and expect to continue to qualify for, the end - user exception from the mandatory clearing requirements for swaps entered to hedge our interest rate risks. Pursuant to the Dodd - Frank Act, however, the CFTC or federal banking regulators may require the posting of collateral with respect to uncleared interest rate derivative transactions.. Certain banking regulators and the CFTC have recently adopted final rules establishing minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps. Although we qualify for the end - user exception from such margin requirements for swaps entered into to hedge our commercial risks, the application of such requirements to other market participants, such. 24. Table of Contents. as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. Moreover, if any of our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end - user exception, we may be required to post additional cash margin or collateral, which could impact our liquidity and reduce our ability to use cash for capital expenditures or other partnership purposes.. The full impact of the Dodd - Frank Act and related regulatory requirements upon our business will not be known until the regulations are implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. The Dodd - Frank Act and regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, or reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd - Frank Act and regulations implementing the Dodd - Frank Act our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could materially adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.. In addition, the European Union and other non - U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations on us is uncertain.. The vote by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union could adversely affect our results of operations, business and financial position and ability to make cash distributions.. In March 2017, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\") formally notified the European Counsel of the commencement of the process by which the United Kingdom will exit (\"Brexit\") from the European Union under Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union. This notification began a two-year period pursuant to which the U.K. and the remaining European Union Member States will negotiate a withdrawal agreement. The United Kingdom is scheduled to withdraw from the European Union in March 2019.. We have take - or - pay off - take contracts with utilities and large power generators in the United Kingdom and in other European markets. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 66% of our product sales were derived from contracts with customers in the United Kingdom and 34% of our product sales were derived from contracts with customers in other European markets.. Brexit may create uncertainty with respect to the legal and regulatory requirements to which we and our customers in the United Kingdom are subject and lead to divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom government determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate. The absence of precedent for an exit of a European Member State from the European Union means that it is unclear how the access of United Kingdom businesses to the European Union Single Market and how the legal and regulatory environments in the United Kingdom and the European Union could be impacted by Brexit, and ultimately how Brexit could impact our business or that of our customers.. The consequences of Brexit, together with what may be protracted negotiations around the terms of Brexit, could also introduce significant uncertainties into global financial markets and adversely impact the markets in which we and our customers operate. For example, prolonged exchange rate volatility or weakness of the local currencies of our customers relative to the U.S. Dollar may impair the purchasing power of our customers and cause them to default on payment or seek modification of the terms of our off - take contracts. The impacts of Brexit may also adversely affect our ability to re - negotiate our existing contracts on terms acceptable to us as they expire or enter into new contracts with new or existing customers.. These uncertainties surrounding Brexit and risks associated with the commencement of Brexit could have a material adverse effect on our operations, business and financial position, as well as our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.. 25. Table of Contents. The viability of our customers' businesses may also affect demand for our products and the results of our business and operations.. The viability of our customers' businesses is dependent on their ability to compete in their respective electricity and heat markets. Our customers' competitiveness is a function of, among other things, the market price of electricity, the market price of competing fuels (e.g. coal and natural gas), the relative cost of carbon and the costs of generating heat or electricity using other renewable energy technologies. Changes in the values of the inputs and outputs of our customers' businesses, or of the businesses of their competitors, could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.. The growth of our business depends in part upon locating and acquiring interests in additional production plants and deep - water marine terminals at favorable prices.. Our business strategy includes growing our business through drop - down and third - party acquisitions that increase our cash generated from operations and cash available for distribution on a per unit basis. Various factors could affect the availability of attractive projects to grow our business, including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour sponsor's failure to complete its or the Hancock JVs' development projects in a timely manner or at all, which could result from, among other things, permitting challenges, failure to procure the requisite financing or equipment, construction difficulties or an inability to obtain an off - take contract on acceptable terms;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour sponsor's failure to offer its assets or the assets of the Hancock JVs for sale;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour failure or inability to exercise our right of first offer with respect to any asset that our sponsor offers, or compels the Hancock JVs to offer, to us; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfewer third - party acquisition opportunities than we expect, which could result from, among other things, available projects having less desirable economic returns, competition, anti - trust concerns or higher risk profiles than we believe suitable for our business plan and investment strategy.. Any of these factors could prevent us from executing our growth strategy or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.. Any acquisitions we make may reduce, rather than increase, our cash generated from operations on a per unit basis.. We may consummate acquisitions that we believe will be accretive, but result in a decrease in our cash available for distribution per unit. Any acquisition involves potential risks, some of which are beyond our control, including, among other things:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmistaken assumptions about revenues and costs, including synergies;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our business and newly acquired assets;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe assumption of unknown liabilities;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;. 26. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmistaken assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe diversion of management's attention to other business concerns;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunforeseen difficulties in connection with operating in new product areas or new geographic areas;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcustomer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability to meet the obligations in off - take contracts associated with acquired production plants.. If we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of our funds and other resources.. If there are significant increases in the cost of raw materials or our suppliers suffer from operating or financial difficulties, we could generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows or lose our ability to meet commitments to our customers.. We purchase wood fiber from third - party landowners and other suppliers for use at our production plants. Our reliance on third parties to secure wood fiber exposes us to potential price volatility and unavailability of such raw materials, and the associated costs may exceed our ability to pass through such price increases under our contracts with our customers. Further, delays or disruptions in obtaining wood fiber may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers, including extreme weather, production or delivery disruptions, inadequate logging capacity, labor disputes, impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, the inability of suppliers to comply with regulatory or sustainability requirements or decreased availability of raw materials. In addition, other companies, whether or not in our industry, could procure wood fiber within our procurement areas and adversely change regional market dynamics, resulting in insufficient quantities of raw material or higher prices. Any of these events could increase our operating costs or prevent us from meeting our commitments to our customers, and thereby could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.. Any interruption or delay in the supply of wood fiber, or our inability to obtain wood fiber at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demands of our customers and expand our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.. We are exposed to the credit risk of our contract counterparties, including the customers for our products, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers could adversely affect our financial results and cash available for distribution.. We are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our contract counterparties, including our long-term off-take customers, whose operations are concentrated in the European power generation industry. Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully eliminate counterparty credit risk. If we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers, or if their creditworthiness deteriorates unexpectedly, any resulting unremedied nonpayment or nonperformance by them could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.. The satisfactory delivery of substantially all of our production is dependent upon continuous access to infrastructure at our owned, leased and third - party-operated ports. Loss of access to our ports of shipment and destination, including through failure of port equipment and port closures, could adversely affect our financial results and cash available for distribution.. A significant portion of our total production is loaded for shipment utilizing automated conveyor and ship loading equipment at the Port of Chesapeake, Port of Wilmington, and Port Panama City, and substantially all of our. 27. Table of Contents. production is dependent upon infrastructure at our owned and third - party operated ports. Should we suffer a catastrophic failure of the equipment at these ports or otherwise experience port closures, including for security or weather - related reasons, we could be unable to fulfill off - take obligations or incur substantial additional transportation costs, which would reduce our cash flow. Moreover, we rely on various ports of destination, as well as third parties who provide stevedoring or other services at our ports of shipment and destination or from whom we charter oceangoing vessels and crews, to transport our product to our customers. Loss of access to these ports for any reason, or failure of such third - party service providers to uphold their contractual obligations, may impact our ability to fulfill off - take obligations, cause interruptions to our shipping schedule, and/or cause us to incur substantial additional transportation or other costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Fluctuations in transportation costs and the availability or reliability of shipping, rail or truck transportation could reduce revenues by causing us to reduce our production or by impairing our ability to deliver products to our customers or the ability of our customers to take delivery of our products.. Disruptions of local or regional transportation services due to shortages of vessels, barges, railcars or trucks, weather - related problems, flooding, drought, accidents, mechanical difficulties, bankruptcy, strikes, lockouts, bottlenecks or other events could temporarily impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and might, in certain circumstances, constitute a force majeure event under our customer contracts, permitting our customers to suspend taking delivery of and paying for our products.. In addition, persistent disruptions in marine transportation may force us to halt production as we reach storage capacity at our deep - water marine terminals. Accordingly, if the transportation services we use to transport our products are disrupted, and we are unable to find alternative transportation providers, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.. Our long - term off - take contracts with our customers may only partially offset certain increases in our costs or preclude us from taking advantage of relatively high wood prices.. Our long-term off - take contracts typically set base prices subject to annual price escalation and other pricing adjustments for changes in certain of our underlying costs of operations, including, in some cases, for stumpage or shipping fuel. However, such cost pass - through mechanisms may only pass a portion of our total costs through to our customers. If our operating costs increase significantly during the terms of our long-term off - take contracts beyond the levels of pricing and cost protection afforded to us under the terms of such contracts, our results of operations, business and financial position, and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders could be materially adversely affected.. Moreover, during periods when the price of wood pellets exceeds the prices under our long-term off-take contracts, our revenues could be significantly lower than they otherwise could have been were we not party to such contracts for substantially all of our production. In addition, our current and future competitors may be in a better position than we are to take advantage of relatively high prices during such periods.. We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain and improve our facilities.. Although we currently use a portion of our cash reserves and cash generated from our operations to maintain, develop and improve our assets and facilities, such investment may, over time, be insufficient to preserve the operating profile required for us to meet our planned profitability or meet the evolving quality and product specifications demanded by our customers. Accordingly, if additional capital expenditures become necessary in the future and we are unable to execute our maintenance or improvement programs successfully and in a timely manner, our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders, may be materially adversely affected.. 28. Table of Contents. We compete with other wood pellet producers and, if growth in domestic and global demand for wood pellets meets or exceeds management's expectations, the competition within our industry may grow significantly.. We compete with other wood pellet production companies for the customers to whom we sell our products. Other current producers of utility - grade wood pellets include AS Graanul Invest, Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc., Drax Biomass Inc., Georgia Biomass, LLC, Fram Renewable Fuels, LLC, Highland Pellets LLC, Pacific BioEnergy Corporation and The Westervelt Company. Competition in our industry is based on price, consistency and quality of product, site location, distribution and logistics capabilities, customer service, creditworthiness and reliability of supply. Some of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do, may develop technology superior to ours or may have production plants that are sited in more advantageous locations from a transport or other cost perspective.. In addition, we expect global demand for solid biomass to increase significantly in the coming years. This demand growth may lead to a significant increase in the production levels of our existing competitors and may incentivize new, well - capitalized competitors to enter the industry, both of which could reduce the demand and the prices we are able to obtain under future off - take contracts. Significant price decreases or reduced demand could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.. For our products to be acceptable to our customers, they must comply with stringent sustainability requirements, which may continue to develop and change.. Biomass energy generation requires the use of biomass that is derived from acceptable sources and is demonstrably sustainable. This typically is implemented through biomass sustainability criteria, which either are a mandatory element of eligibility for financial subsidies to biomass energy generators or will become mandatory in the future. As a biomass fuel supplier, the viability of our business is therefore dependent upon our ability to comply with such requirements. This may restrict the types of biomass we can use and the geographic regions from which we source our raw materials, and may require us to reduce the GHG emissions associated with our supply and production processes. Currently, some elements of the criteria with which we will have to comply, including rules relating to forest management practices, are not yet finalized. If more stringent sustainability requirements are adopted in the future, demand for our products could be materially reduced in certain markets, and our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders, may be materially adversely affected as a result.. Our level of indebtedness may increase and reduce our financial flexibility.. As of December 31, 2017, our total debt was $401.0 million, which primarily consisted of $352.2 million outstanding under the Senior Notes and $43.6 million outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. In the future, we may incur additional indebtedness in order to make acquisitions or to develop our properties. Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta significant portion of our cash flows could be used to service our indebtedness;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay distributions and make certain investments;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour debt covenants may also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta high level of debt would increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may be less leveraged and therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness would prevent us from pursuing; and. 29. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta high level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, general partnership or other purposes.. In addition, borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities bear, and potentially other credit facilities we or our subsidiaries may enter into in the future will bear, interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, such variable - rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flow.. In addition to our debt service obligations, our operations require substantial expenditures on a continuing basis. Our ability to make scheduled debt payments, to refinance our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to fund capital and non - capital expenditures necessary to maintain the condition of our operating assets and properties, as well as to provide capacity for the growth of our business, depends on our financial and operating performance. General economic conditions and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt.. An increase in the price or a significant interruption in the supply of electricity could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.. Our production plants use a substantial amount of electricity. The price and supply of electricity are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other events outside our control, such as changes in supply and demand due to weather conditions, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. In addition, potential climate change regulations or carbon or emissions taxes could result in higher production costs for electricity, which may be passed on to us in whole or in part. A significant increase in the price of electricity or an extended interruption in the supply of electricity to our production plants could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and ability to make cash distributions.. Changes in the price of diesel fuel may adversely affect our results of operations.. Diesel fuel costs generally fluctuate with world crude oil prices, and accordingly are subject to political, economic and market factors that are outside of our control. Our operations are dependent on rolling stock and trucks, and diesel fuel costs are a significant component of the operating expense of these vehicles. In addition, diesel fuel is consumed by our wood suppliers in the harvesting and transport of our raw material and is therefore a component of the delivered cost we pay for wood fiber. It is also consumed by the handling equipment at our plants. Some of our off - take contracts contain mechanisms that are intended to reduce the impact that changes in the price of diesel fuel would have on us, but these mechanisms may not be effective. Accordingly, changes in diesel fuel prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and ability to make cash distributions.. Our business may suffer if we lose, or are unable to attract and retain, key personnel.. We depend to a large extent on the services of our senior management team and other key personnel. Members of our senior management and other key employees collectively have extensive expertise in designing, building and operating wood pellet production plants, negotiating long - term off - take contracts and managing businesses such as ours. Competition for management and key personnel is intense, and the pool of qualified candidates is limited. The loss of any of these individuals or the failure to attract additional personnel, as needed, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and could lead to higher labor costs or the use of less - qualified personnel. In addition, if any of our executives or other key employees were to join a competitor or form a competing company, we could lose customers, suppliers, know - how and key personnel. Our success is dependent on our ability to continue to attract, employ and retain highly skilled personnel.. Failure to maintain effective quality control systems at our production plants and deep - water marine terminals could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.. Our customers require a reliable supply of wood pellets that meet stringent product specifications. We have built our operations and assets to consistently deliver and certify the highest levels of product quality and performance,. 30. Table of Contents. which is critical to the success of our business. These factors depend significantly on the effectiveness of our quality control systems which, in turn, depends on a number of factors. These include the design and efficacy of our quality control systems, the success of our quality training program and our ability to ensure that our employees and third - party contractors adhere to our quality control policies and guidelines. Any significant failure or deterioration of our quality control systems could impact our ability to deliver product that meets our customers' specifications and, in turn, could lead to rejection of our product by our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. Our business is subject to operating hazards and other operational risks, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation. We may also not be adequately insured against such events.. Our business could be adversely affected by operating hazards and other risks to our operations. We produce a combustible product that may under certain circumstances present a risk of fires and explosions or other hazards. Severe weather, such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other natural disasters, climatic phenomena, such as drought, and other catastrophic events, such as plant or shipping disasters, could impact our operations by causing damage to our facilities and equipment, affecting our ability to deliver our product to our customers and impacting our customers' ability to take delivery of our products. Such events may also adversely affect the ability of our suppliers to provide us with the raw materials we require or the ability of vessels to load, transport and unload our product.. We maintain insurance policies to mitigate against certain risks related to our business, in types and amounts that we believe are reasonable depending on the circumstances surrounding each identified risk; however, we may not be fully insured against all operating hazards and other operational risks incident to our business. Furthermore, we may be unable to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates, if at all. As a result of market conditions and certain claims we may make under our insurance policies, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could escalate. In some instances, insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage or at unreasonable rates. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we are not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.. Our operations are subject to stringent environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.. Our operations are subject to stringent federal, regional, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern environmental protection, occupational health and safety, the release or discharge of materials into the environment, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the investigation and remediation of contaminated sites and allocation of liability for cleanup of such sites. These laws and regulations may restrict or impact our business in many ways, including by requiring us to acquire permits or other approvals to conduct regulated activities; limiting our air emissions or wastewater discharges or requiring us to install costly equipment to control, reduce or treat such emissions or discharges; imposing requirements on the handling or disposal of wastes; impacting our ability to modify or expand our operations (for example, by limiting or prohibiting construction and operating activities in environmentally sensitive areas); and imposing health and safety requirements for worker protection. We may be required to make significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, suspension or revocation of permits and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. Adoption of new or modified environmental laws and regulations may impair the operation of our business, delay or prevent expansion of existing facilities or construction of new facilities and otherwise result in increased costs and liabilities, which may be material.. Our business and operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations.. Our business is affected to some extent by seasonal fluctuations. The cost of producing wood pellets tends to be higher in colder periods because the delivered cost of fiber typically increases with wet weather and our raw materials have, on average, higher moisture content during such period, resulting in a lower product yield. In addition, lower ambient temperatures increase the cost of drying wood fiber. Seasonality may also impact the availability and pricing of. 31. Table of Contents. limited-scope wood pellet purchase and sale transactions. For example, colder periods typically drive increased demand for wood pellets in the heating and industrial markets, which can increase pricing for prompt deliveries, while warmer periods typically have the opposite effect. While our contracts generally call for ratable deliveries throughout the year, we are party to one contract that calls for a higher percentage of deliveries during the first and fourth calendar quarters. These seasonal fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cause comparisons of operating measures between consecutive quarters may not be as meaningful as comparisons between longer reporting periods.. A terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.. Terrorist activities and armed conflicts could adversely affect the U.S. and global economies and could prevent us from meeting financial and other obligations or prevent our customers from meeting their obligations to us. We could experience loss of business, delays or defaults in payments from customers or disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, including if domestic and global power generators are direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. Terrorist activities and the threat of potential terrorist activities and any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely impact our ability to realize certain business strategies.. Risks Related to Our Partnership Structure. Enviva Holdings, LP owns and controls our General Partner, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. Our General Partner and its affiliates, including Enviva Holdings, LP, have conflicts of interest with us and limited duties, and they may favor their own interests to our detriment and that of our unitholders.. Enviva Holdings, LP, owns and controls our General Partner and appoints all of the directors of our General Partner. Although our General Partner has a duty to manage us in a manner that it believes is not adverse to our interest, the executive officers and directors of our General Partner have a fiduciary duty to manage our General Partner in a manner beneficial to our sponsor. Therefore, conflicts of interest may arise between our sponsor or any of its affiliates, including our General Partner, on the one hand, and us or any of our unitholders, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts of interest, our General Partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our common unitholders. These conflicts include the following situations, among others:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour General Partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us, such as our sponsor, in exercising certain rights under our partnership agreement;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tneither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires our sponsor to pursue a business strategy that favors us;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour partnership agreement eliminates and replaces the fiduciary duties that would otherwise be owed by our General Partner with contractual standards governing its duties, limits our General Partner's liabilities and restricts the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that, without such eliminations and limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texcept in limited circumstances, our General Partner has the power and authority to conduct our business without unitholder approval;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour General Partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, borrowings, issuances of additional partnership securities and the level of reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour General Partner determines the amount and timing of any cash expenditure and whether an expenditure is classified as a maintenance capital expenditure, which reduces operating surplus, or an expansion capital. 32. Table of Contents. expenditure, which does not reduce operating surplus. This determination can affect the amount of cash from operating surplus that is distributed to our unitholders which, in turn, may affect the ability of the subordinated units to convert into common units;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour General Partner may cause us to borrow funds in order to permit the payment of cash distributions;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour partnership agreement permits us to distribute up to $39.3 million as operating surplus, even if it is generated from asset sales, borrowings other than working capital borrowings or other sources that would otherwise constitute capital surplus. This cash may be used to fund distributions on our subordinated units or the incentive distribution rights;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour General Partner determines which costs incurred by it and its affiliates are reimbursable by us;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour partnership agreement does not restrict our General Partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with its affiliates on our behalf;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour General Partner intends to limit its liability regarding our contractual and other obligations;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour General Partner may exercise its right to call and purchase common units if it and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour General Partner controls the enforcement of obligations that it and its affiliates owe to us;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour General Partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour General Partner may elect to cause us to issue common units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to our General Partner's incentive distribution rights without the approval of the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our General Partner or the unitholders. This election may result in lower distributions to the common unitholders in certain situations.. In addition, we may compete directly with our sponsor and entities in which it has an interest for acquisition opportunities and potentially will compete with these entities for new business or extensions of the existing services provided by us.. The board of directors of our General Partner may modify or revoke our cash distribution policy at any time at its discretion. Our partnership agreement does not require us to pay any distributions at all.. Pursuant to our cash distribution policy, we intend to distribute quarterly at least $0.4125 per unit on all of our units to the extent we have sufficient cash after the establishment of cash reserves and the payment of our expenses, including payments to our General Partner and its affiliates. However, the board may change such policy at any time at its discretion and could elect not to pay distributions for one or more quarters. Please read Part II, Item 5. \"Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Cash Distribution Policy.\". In addition, our partnership agreement does not require us to pay any distributions at all. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the permanence of such a policy in making an investment decision. Any modification or revocation of our cash distribution policy could substantially reduce or eliminate the amounts of distributions to our unitholders. The amount of distributions we make, if any, and the decision to make any distribution at all will be determined by the board of directors of our General Partner, whose interests may differ from those of our common unitholders. Our General Partner has limited duties to our unitholders, which may permit it to favor its own interests or the interests of our sponsor to the detriment of our common unitholders.. 33. Table of Contents. Our General Partner limits its liability regarding our obligations.. Our General Partner limits its liability under contractual arrangements between us and third parties so that the counterparties to such arrangements have recourse only against our assets, and not against our General Partner or its assets. Our General Partner may therefore cause us to incur indebtedness or other obligations that are nonrecourse to our General Partner. Our partnership agreement provides that any action taken by our General Partner to limit its liability is not a breach of our General Partner's duties, even if we could have obtained more favorable terms without the limitation on liability. In addition, we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify our General Partner to the extent that it incurs obligations on our behalf. Any such reimbursement or indemnification payments would reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders.. We intend to distribute a significant portion of our cash available for distribution to our partners, which could limit our ability to grow and make acquisitions.. We intend to distribute most of our cash available for distribution, which may cause our growth to proceed at a slower pace than that of businesses that reinvest their cash to expand ongoing operations. To the extent we issue additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level. There are no limitations in our partnership agreement on our ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt to finance our growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which, in turn, may impact the cash that we have available to distribute to our unitholders.. Our partnership agreement eliminates and replaces our General Partner's fiduciary duties to holders of our units.. Our partnership agreement contains provisions that eliminate and replace the fiduciary standards to which our General Partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement permits our General Partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our General Partner, or otherwise free of fiduciary duties to us and our unitholders. This entitles our General Partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires and relieves it of any duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or our limited partners. Examples of decisions that our General Partner may make in its individual capacity include:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thow to allocate business opportunities among us and its affiliates;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhether to exercise its call right;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhether to seek approval of the resolutions of a conflict of interest by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our General Partner;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thow to exercise its voting rights with respect to the units it owns;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhether to exercise its registration rights;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhether to elect to reset target distribution levels; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhether or not to consent to any merger or consolidation of the partnership or amendment to the partnership agreement.. Limited partners who own common units are treated as having consented to the provisions in the partnership agreement, including the provisions discussed above.. 34. Table of Contents. Our partnership agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of our units for actions taken by our General Partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.. Our partnership agreement contains provisions that restrict the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our General Partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty under state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement provides that:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhenever our General Partner makes a determination or takes, or declines to take, any other action in its capacity as our General Partner, our General Partner is generally required to make such determination, or take or decline to take such other action, in good faith, and will not be subject to any higher standard imposed by our partnership agreement, Delaware law, or any other law, rule or regulation, or at equity;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour General Partner and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages or otherwise to us or our limited partners resulting from any act or omission unless there has been a final and non - appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that such losses or liabilities were the result of conduct in which our General Partner or its officers or directors engaged in bad faith, meaning that they believed that the decision was adverse to the interest of the partnership or, with respect to any criminal conduct, with knowledge that such conduct was unlawful; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour General Partner will not be in breach of its obligations under the partnership agreement or its duties to us or our limited partners if a transaction with an affiliate or the resolution of a conflict of interest is:. (1) \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tapproved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our General Partner, although our General Partner is not obligated to seek such approval; or. (2) \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tapproved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding common units, excluding any common units owned by our General Partner and its affiliates.. In connection with a situation involving a transaction with an affiliate or a conflict of interest, other than one where our General Partner is permitted to act in its sole discretion, any determination by our General Partner must be made in good faith. If an affiliate transaction or the resolution of a conflict of interest is not approved by our common unitholders or the conflicts committee then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, taking any action or failing to act, the board of directors acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or the partnership, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption.. Our sponsor and other affiliates of our General Partner may compete with us.. Our partnership agreement provides that our General Partner is restricted from engaging in any business activities other than acting as our General Partner, engaging in those activities incidental to its ownership interest in us and providing management, advisory and administrative services to its affiliates or to other persons. However, affiliates of our General Partner, including our sponsor, are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in direct competition with us. In addition, our sponsor may compete with us for investment opportunities and may own an interest in entities that compete with us.. Pursuant to the terms of our partnership agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, does not apply to our General Partner or any of its affiliates, including its executive officers and directors and our sponsor. Any such person or entity that becomes aware of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for us will not have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to us. Any such person or entity will not be liable to us or to any limited partner for breach of any fiduciary duty or other duty by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to another person or entity or does not communicate such opportunity or information to us. This may create actual and potential conflicts of interest between us and affiliates of our General Partner and result in less than favorable treatment of us and our unitholders.. 35. Table of Contents. The holder or holders of our incentive distribution rights may elect to cause us to issue common units to it in connection with a resetting of the incentive distribution without the approval of our unitholders. This election may result in lower distributions to our common unitholders in certain situations.. The holder or holders of a majority of our incentive distribution rights (currently our General Partner) have the right, at any time when there are no subordinated units outstanding and we have made cash distributions in excess of the then - applicable third target distribution for each of the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters, to reset the initial target distribution levels at higher levels based on our cash distribution levels at the time of the exercise of the reset election. Following a reset election, a baseline distribution amount will be calculated equal to an amount equal to the prior cash distribution per common unit for the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the reset election (such amount is referred to as the \"reset minimum quarterly distribution\"), and the target distribution levels will be reset to correspondingly higher levels based on percentage increases above the reset minimum quarterly distribution.. We anticipate that our General Partner would exercise this reset right in order to facilitate acquisitions or internal growth projects that would not be sufficiently accretive to cash distributions per unit without such conversion. However, our General Partner may transfer the incentive distribution rights at any time. It is possible that our General Partner or a transferee could exercise this reset election at a time when we are experiencing declines in our aggregate cash distributions or at a time when the holders of the incentive distribution rights expect that we will experience declines in our aggregate cash distributions in the foreseeable future. In such situations, the holders of the incentive distribution rights may be experiencing, or may expect to experience, declines in the cash distributions they receive related to the incentive distribution rights and may therefore desire to be issued our common units, which are entitled to specified priorities with respect to our distributions and which therefore may be more advantageous for them to own in lieu of the right to receive incentive distribution payments based on target distribution levels that are less certain to be achieved. As a result, a reset election may cause our common unitholders to experience dilution in the amount of cash distributions that they would have otherwise received had we not issued new common units to the holders of the incentive distribution rights in connection with resetting the target distribution levels.. Our general partner has certain incentive distribution rights that reduce the amount of our cash available for distribution to our common unitholders.. Our General Partner currently holds incentive distribution rights that entitle it to receive an increasing percentage (15 percent, 25 percent and 50 percent) of the cash that we distribute to our common unitholders from available cash after the minimum quarterly distribution and certain target distribution levels have been achieved. The maximum distribution right for our General Partner to receive 50 percent of any distributions paid to our common unitholders does not include any distributions that our General Partner or its affiliates may receive on common units that they own. Effective as of our quarterly cash distribution in the fourth quarter of 2017, our General Partner was at the top tier of the incentive distribution rights scale. Given that a higher percentage of our cash flows is allocated to our general partner due to these incentive distribution rights, it may be more difficult for us to increase the amount of distributions to our unitholders and our cost of capital may be higher, making investments, capital expenditures and acquisitions, and therefore, future growth, by us potentially more costly, and in some cases, potentially prohibitively so.. Holders of our common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our General Partner or its directors, which could reduce the price at which our common units will trade.. Compared to the holders of common stock in a corporation, unitholders have limited voting rights and, therefore, limited ability to influence management's decisions regarding our business. Unitholders have no right on an annual or ongoing basis to elect our General Partner or its board of directors. The board of directors of our General Partner, including the independent directors, is chosen entirely by our sponsor, as a result of it owning our General Partner, and not by our unitholders. Unlike publicly traded corporations, we do not hold annual meetings of our unitholders to elect directors or consider other matters routinely addressed at annual meetings of stockholders of corporations. As a result of these limitations, the price at which the common units trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price.. 36. Table of Contents. Even if holders of our common units are dissatisfied, they cannot currently remove our General Partner without our sponsor's consent.. If our unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our General Partner, they have limited ability to remove our General Partner. Unitholders are currently unable to remove our General Partner without our sponsor's consent because our sponsor and its affiliates own sufficient units to be able to prevent its removal. The vote of the holders of at least 662/3% of all outstanding common and subordinated units voting together as a single class is required to remove our General Partner. As of February 16, 2018, our sponsor owned approximately 50% of our common and subordinated units, taken together. In addition, any vote to remove our General Partner during the subordination period must provide for the election of a successor General Partner by the holders of a majority of the common units and a majority of the subordinated units, voting as separate classes. Both of these conditions provide our sponsor the ability to prevent the removal of our General Partner.. Our general partner interest or the control of our General Partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.. Our General Partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party without the consent of our unitholders. Furthermore, our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of the owner of our General Partner to transfer its membership interests in our General Partner to a third party. The new owner of our General Partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and executive officers of our General Partner with its own designees and thereby exert significant control over the decisions taken by the board of directors and executive officers of our General Partner. This effectively permits a \"change of control\" without the vote or consent of the unitholders.. The incentive distribution rights may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.. Our General Partner may transfer the incentive distribution rights to a third party at any time without the consent of our unitholders. If our General Partner transfers the incentive distribution rights to a third party, our General Partner would not have the same incentive to grow our partnership and increase quarterly distributions to unitholders over time. For example, a transfer of incentive distribution rights by our General Partner could reduce the likelihood of our sponsor accepting offers made by us relating to assets owned by our sponsor, as it would have less of an economic incentive to grow our business, which in turn would impact our ability to grow our asset base.. Our General Partner has a call right that may require unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price.. If at any time our General Partner and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units, our General Partner will have the right, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, but not the obligation, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price equal to the greater of (1) the average of the daily closing price of the common units over the 20 trading days preceding the date three days before notice of exercise of the call right is first mailed and (2) the highest per - unit price paid by our General Partner or any of its affiliates for common units during the 90 - day period preceding the date such notice is first mailed. As a result, unitholders may be required to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return or a negative return on their investment. Unitholders may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their units. Our General Partner is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the value of the common units to be repurchased by it upon exercise of the call right. There is no restriction in our partnership agreement that prevents our General Partner from causing us to issue additional common units and then exercising its call right. If our General Partner exercised its call right, the effect would be to take us private and, if the units were subsequently deregistered, we would no longer be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.. 37. Table of Contents. We may issue additional units without unitholder approval, which would dilute existing unitholder ownership interests.. Our partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional limited partner interests we may issue at any time without the approval of our unitholders. The issuance of additional common units or other equity interests of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour existing unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbecause a lower percentage of total outstanding units will be subordinated units, the risk that a shortfall in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution will be borne by our common unitholders will increase;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe market price of the common units may decline.. There are no limitations in our partnership agreement on our ability to issue units ranking senior to the common units.. In accordance with Delaware law and the provisions of our partnership agreement, we may issue additional partnership interests that are senior to the common units in right of distribution, liquidation and voting. The issuance by us of units of senior rank may (i) reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for distribution to our common unitholders; (ii) diminish the relative voting strength of the total common units outstanding as a class; or (iii) subordinate the claims of the common unitholders to our assets in the event of our liquidation.. The market price of our common units could be adversely affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common units in the public or private markets, including sales by our sponsor or other large holders.. All of the subordinated units will convert into common units on a one - for - one basis at the end of the subordination period, which is expected to occur in May 2018. Our sponsor has registration rights with respect to the common units it currently holds and the common units it will hold upon conversion of the subordinated units. Sales by our sponsor or other large holders of a substantial number of our common units in the public markets, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common units or could impair our ability to obtain capital through an offering of equity securities.. Our partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20% or more of our common units.. Our partnership agreement restricts unitholders' voting rights by providing that any units held by a person or group that owns 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding, other than our General Partner and its affiliates, their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our General Partner, cannot vote on any matter.. Cost reimbursements due to our General Partner and its affiliates for services provided to us or on our behalf will reduce cash available for distribution to our unitholders. The amount and timing of such reimbursements will be determined by our General Partner.. Under our management services agreement with Enviva Management (the \"MSA\"), we are obligated to reimburse Enviva Management for all direct or indirect costs and expenses incurred by, or chargeable to, Enviva Management in connection with its provision of services necessary for the operation of our business. If the MSA were. 38. Table of Contents. terminated without replacement, or our General Partner or its affiliates provided services outside of the scope of the MSA, our partnership agreement would require us to reimburse our General Partner and its affiliates for all expenses they incur and payments they make on our behalf. Our partnership agreement does not set a limit on the amount of expenses for which our General Partner and its affiliates may be reimbursed. These expenses include salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other amounts paid to persons who perform services for us or on our behalf and expenses allocated to our General Partner by its affiliates. Our partnership agreement provides that our General Partner determines the expenses that are allocable to us. The reimbursement of expenses and payment of fees, if any, to our General Partner and its affiliates will reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders.. The price of our common units may fluctuate significantly and unitholders could lose all or part of their investment.. The market price of our common units may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour quarterly distributions;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic conditions;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common units or changes in financial estimates by analysts;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfuture sales of our common units; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe other factors described in these \"Risk Factors.\". Unitholders may have liability to repay distributions.. Under certain circumstances, unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under Section 17 - 607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, we may not make a distribution to our unitholders if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount. Liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities that are non - recourse to the partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted.. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain disclosure requirements that apply to other public companies.. For as long as we remain an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to provide an auditor's attestation report on management's assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, although we will lose that status earlier if we have more than $1.0 billion of revenues in a fiscal year, have more than $700.0 million in market value of our common units held by non - affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non - convertible debt over a three - year period.. To the extent that we rely on any of the exemptions available to emerging growth companies, our unitholders will receive less information about our executive compensation and internal control over financial reporting than issuers. 39. Table of Contents. that are not emerging growth companies. If some investors find our common units to be less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common units and our trading price may be more volatile.. The New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") does not require a publicly traded partnership like us to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements.. Our common units are listed on the NYSE. Because we are a publicly traded partnership, the NYSE does not require us to have a majority of independent directors on our General Partner's board of directors or to establish a compensation committee or a nominating and corporate governance committee. Accordingly, unitholders do not have the same protections afforded to certain corporations that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements. Please read Part III, Item 10. \"Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance - Director Independence.\". Tax Risks to Common Unitholders. Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not being subject to a material amount of entity - level taxation. If the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, or we become subject to entity - level taxation for state tax purposes, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced.. The anticipated after - tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.. Despite the fact that we are organized as a limited partnership under Delaware law, we would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless we satisfy a \"qualifying income\" requirement. Based upon our current operations, we believe we satisfy the qualifying income requirement. We have requested and obtained a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that, based on facts presented in the private letter ruling request, our income from processing timber feedstocks into pellets and transporting, storing, marketing and distributing such timber feedstocks and wood pellets constitute \"qualifying income\" within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \"Code\"). However, no ruling has been or will be requested regarding our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Failing to meet the qualifying income requirement or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity.. If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate. Distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to our unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. Therefore, treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after - tax return to the unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units.. Our partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity - level taxation for U.S. federal, state, local or foreign income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law or interpretation on us. At the state level, several states have been evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity - level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise or other forms of taxation. Specifically, we currently own assets and conduct business in Mississippi, North Carolina, Florida and Virginia, each of which imposes a margin or franchise tax. In the future, we may expand our operations. Imposition of a similar tax on us in other jurisdictions that we may expand to could substantially reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.. The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes or differing interpretations, possibly applied on a retroactive basis.. The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any. 40. Table of Contents. time. From time to time, members of Congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. Although there is no current legislative proposal, a prior legislative proposal would have eliminated the qualifying income exception to the treatment of all publicly traded partnerships as corporations upon which we rely for our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.. In addition, on January 24, 2017, final regulations regarding which activities give rise to qualifying income within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code (the \"Final Regulations\") were published in the Federal Register. The Final Regulations are effective as of January 19, 2017 and apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 19, 2017 and, consistent with our private letter ruling, the Final Regulations generally treat income from the production, transportation and marketing of wood pellets as qualifying income. However, there can be no assurance that there would not be further changes to the Treasury Department's interpretation of the qualifying income rules in a manner that could impact our ability to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.. Any modification to the U.S. federal income tax laws may be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to meet the exception for certain publicly traded partnerships to be treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units. You are urged to consult with your own tax advisor with respect to the status of regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on your investment in our common units.. If the IRS were to contest the federal income tax positions we take, it may adversely impact the market for our common units, and the costs of any such contest would reduce cash available for distribution to our unitholders.. We have requested and obtained a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that, based on facts presented in the private letter ruling request, our income from processing timber feedstocks into pellets and transporting, storing, marketing and distributing such timber feedstocks and wood pellets will constitute \"qualifying income\" within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, no ruling has been or will be requested regarding our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the positions we take. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take. A court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take. Any contest with the IRS may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which they trade. Moreover, the costs of any contest between us and the IRS will result in a reduction in cash available for distribution to our unitholders and thus will be borne indirectly by our unitholders.. If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, it (and some states) may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustments directly from us, in which case we may require our unitholders and former unitholders to reimburse us for such taxes (including any applicable penalties or interest) or, if we are required to bear such payments, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced.. Pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns, it (and some states) may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from us. To the extent possible under the new rules, our General Partner may elect to either pay the taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly to the IRS or, if we are eligible, issue a revised information statement to each unitholder and former unitholder with respect to an audited and adjusted return, which statement reports the items adjusted and certain other amounts. Although our General Partner may elect to have our unitholders and former unitholders take such audit adjustment into account in accordance with their interests in us during the tax year under audit, there can be no assurance that such election will be practical, permissible or effective in all circumstances. As a result, our current unitholders may bear some or all of the tax liability resulting from such audit adjustment, even if such unitholders did not own units in us during the tax year under audit. If, as a result of any such audit adjustment, we are required to make payments of taxes, penalties and interest, we may require our unitholders and former unitholders to reimburse us for such taxes (including any applicable penalties or interest) or, if we are required to bear such payments, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced. These rules are not applicable for tax years beginning on or prior to December 31, 2017.. 41. Table of Contents. Even if unitholders do not receive any cash distributions from us, unitholders will be required to pay taxes on their share of our taxable income.. Unitholders are required to pay federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes, on unitholders' share of our taxable income, whether or not they receive cash distributions from us. For example, if we sell assets and use the proceeds to repay existing debt or fund capital expenditures, you may be allocated taxable income and gain resulting from the sale, and our cash available for distribution would not increase. Similarly, taking advantage of opportunities to reduce our existing debt, such as debt exchanges, debt repurchases, or modifications of our existing debt could result in \"cancellation of indebtedness income\" being allocated to our unitholders as taxable income without any increase in our cash available for distribution. Unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax due from them with respect to that income.. A tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than unitholders expect.. If unitholders sell their common units, they will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and their tax basis in those common units. Because distributions in excess of unitholders' allocable share of our net taxable income decrease their tax basis in their common units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the units unitholders sell will, in effect, become taxable income to our unitholders if they sell such units at a price greater than their tax basis in those units, even if the price they receive is less than their original cost. In addition, because the amount realized includes a unitholder's share of our nonrecourse liabilities, if they sell their units, unitholders may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash they receive from the sale.. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items, including depreciation recapture. Thus, you may recognize both ordinary income and capital loss from the sale of your units if the amount realized on a sale of your units is less than your adjusted basis in the units. Net capital loss may only offset capital gains and, in the case of individuals, up to $3,000 of ordinary income per year. In the taxable period in which you sell your units, you may recognize ordinary income from our allocations of income and gain to you prior to the sale and from recapture items that generally cannot be offset by any capital loss recognized upon the sale of units.. Tax - exempt entities face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.. Investment in common units by tax - exempt entities, such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (known as IRAs), raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax, including IRAs and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them. Further, with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, a tax-exempt entity with more than one unrelated trade or business (including by attribution from investment in a partnership such as ours that is engaged in one or more unrelated trade or business) is required to compute the unrelated business taxable income of such tax-exempt entity separately with respect to each such trade or business (including for purposes of determining any net operating loss deduction). As a result, for years beginning after December 31, 2017, it may not be possible for tax-exempt entities to utilize losses from an investment in our partnership to offset unrelated business taxable income from another unrelated trade or business and vice versa. Any tax - exempt entity should consult their tax advisor before investing in our common units.. Unitholders may be subject to limitation on their ability to deduct interest expense incurred by us.. Historically, we have been entitled to a full deduction for interest paid or accrued on indebtedness properly allocable to our trade or business during our taxable year. However, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in December 2017, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, our deduction for \"business interest\" is limited to the sum of our business interest income and 30% of our \"adjusted taxable income.\" For the purposes of this limitation, our adjusted taxable income is computed without regard to any business interest expense or business interest income, and in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 2022, any deduction allowable for depreciation, amortization or depletion.. 42. Table of Contents. Non-U.S. Unitholders will be subject to U.S. taxes and withholding with respect to their income and gain from owning our units.. Non-U.S. unitholders are generally taxed and subject to income tax filing requirements by the United States on income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business (\"effectively connected income\"). Income allocated to our unitholders and any gain from the sale of our units will generally be considered to be \"effectively connected\" with a U.S. trade or business. As a result, distributions to a non-U.S. unitholder will be subject to withholding at the highest applicable effective tax rate and a non-U.S. unitholder who sells or otherwise disposes of a unit will also be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the gain realized from the sale or disposition of such unit.. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act imposes a withholding obligation of 10% of the amount realized upon a non-U.S. unitholder's sale or exchange of an interest in a partnership that is engaged in a U.S. trade or business. However, due to challenges of administering a withholding obligation applicable to open market trading and other complications, the IRS has temporarily suspended the application of this withholding rule to open market transfers of interests in publicly traded partnerships pending promulgation of regulations or other guidance that resolves the challenges. It is not clear if or when such regulations or other guidance will be issued. Non-U.S. unitholders should consult a tax advisor before investing in our common units.. We treat each purchaser of our common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units.. Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units, we have adopted certain methods for allocating depreciation and amortization deductions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury Regulations. A successful IRS challenge to the use of those methods could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our unitholders. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from our unitholders' sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to their tax returns.. We generally prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.. We generally prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month (the \"Allocation Date\"), instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. Similarly, we generally allocate certain deductions for depreciation of capital additions, gain or loss realized on a sale or other disposition of our assets and, in the discretion of the general partner, any other extraordinary item of income, gain, loss or deduction based upon ownership on the Allocation Date. Treasury Regulations allow a similar monthly simplifying convention, but such regulations do not specifically authorize all aspects of our proration method. If the IRS were to challenge our proration method, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.. A unitholder whose units are the subject of a securities loan (e.g., a loan to a \"short seller\" to cover a short sale of units) may be considered as having disposed of those units. If so, he would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.. Because there are no specific rules governing the U.S. federal income tax consequence of loaning a partnership interest, a unitholder whose units are the subject of a securities loan may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units. In that case, the unitholder may no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a. 43. Table of Contents. securities loan are urged to consult a tax advisor to determine whether it is advisable to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their units.. We have adopted certain valuation methodologies in determining a unitholder's allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction. The IRS may challenge these methodologies or the resulting allocations, which could adversely affect the value of the common units.. In determining the items of income, gain, loss and deduction allocable to our unitholders, we must routinely determine the fair market value of our assets. Although we may, from time to time, consult with professional appraisers regarding valuation matters, we make many fair market value estimates using a methodology based on the market value of our common units as a means to measure the fair market value of our assets. The IRS may challenge these valuation methods and the resulting allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction.. A successful IRS challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the timing or amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders. It also could affect the amount of gain from our unitholders' sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders' tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions.. Our unitholders will likely be subject to state and local taxes and income tax return filing requirements in jurisdictions where they do not live as a result of investing in our common units.. In addition to U.S. federal income taxes, our unitholders may be subject to other taxes, including foreign, state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or own property now or in the future, even if they do not live in any of those jurisdictions. Our unitholders will likely be required to file foreign, state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions. Further, our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements.. We currently own assets in multiple states. Many of these states currently impose a personal income tax on individuals, corporations and other entities. As we make acquisitions or expand our business, we may own assets or conduct business in additional states that impose a personal income tax.
