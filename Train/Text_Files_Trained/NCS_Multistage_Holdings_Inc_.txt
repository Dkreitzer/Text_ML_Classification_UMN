[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. <U+FEFF>. Described below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate. You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors in conjunction with other information provided in this Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing, and consequently, the market value of our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. All forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below.. <U+FEFF>. Risks Related to Our Business and the Oil and Natural Gas Industry. <U+FEFF>. Our business depends on the oil and natural gas industry and particularly on the level of exploration and production activity within Canada and the United States, and the volatility of prices for oil and natural gas has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Demand for our products and services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. The average price of oil during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $50.78 per barrel. This average oil price remains well. 13. Table of Contents. below the average prices in 2014. The low commodity price environment resulted in a reduction in the drilling, completion and other production activities of most of our customers and a reduction in their spending on our products and services. The reduction in demand from our customers reduced the prices we were able to charge our customers for our products and services. Although oil pricing has improved since mid-2016, and the demand for our products and services has subsequently increased, oil and natural gas prices remain volatile, and prolonged reductions in oil and natural gas prices have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Many factors over which we have no control affect the supply of and demand for, and our customers' willingness to explore, develop and produce oil and natural gas, and therefore, influence demand levels and prices for our products and services, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe domestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of prices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe expected decline rates of current production;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe price and quantity of foreign imports;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical and economic conditions in oil producing countries, including the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tspeculative trading in crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of consumer product demand;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontractions in the credit market;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tavailable pipeline and other transportation capacity;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe levels of oil and natural gas storage;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tweather conditions and other natural disasters;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical instability in oil and natural gas producing countries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdomestic and foreign tax policy;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdomestic and foreign governmental approvals and regulatory requirements and conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action, including military action in the Middle East;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttechnical advances affecting energy demand, generation and consumption;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\talternative fuel requirements or technological advances and the demand and availability of alternative fuel sources;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfuel conservation measures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability of oil and natural gas producers to raise equity capital and debt financing;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmerger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toverall domestic and global economic conditions.. <U+FEFF>. These factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty or how long the current low commodity price environment will continue. Any of the above factors could impact the level of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, should the low commodity price environment continue or worsen, we could encounter difficulties such as an inability to access needed capital on attractive terms or at all, the incurrence of asset impairment charges, an inability to meet the financial ratios contained in our debt agreements, a need to reduce our capital spending and other similar impacts any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. 14. Table of Contents. The cyclicality of the oil and natural gas industry may cause our results of operations to fluctuate.. <U+FEFF>. We derive our revenues from companies in the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry, a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and natural gas prices. Prices for oil and natural gas historically have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile. During the past four years, the posted West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price for oil has ranged from a low of $26.21 per barrel, or Bbl, in February 2016 to a high of $107.95 per Bbl in June 2014. Over the same period, the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of $1.49 per million British thermal units, or MMBtu, in March 2016 to a high of $7.92 per MMBtu in March 2014. During 2016, WTI prices ranged from $26.21 to $54.06 per Bbl and during 2017, WTI prices ranged from $42.48 to $60.46 per Bbl. During 2016, the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from $1.49 to $3.80 per MMBtu and during 2017, the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from $2.44 to $3.71 per MMBtu. We have, and may in the future, experience significant fluctuations in operating results as a result of the reactions of our customers to changes in oil and natural gas prices. For example, prolonged low commodity prices experienced by the oil and natural gas industry during 2015 and 2016, combined with adverse changes in the capital and credit markets, caused many E&P companies to reduce their capital budgets and drilling activity. This resulted in a significant decline in demand for oilfield services and adversely impacted the prices oilfield services companies could charge for their services. We have master services agreements (\"MSAs\") with most of our customers which have no minimum purchase requirements. As a result, most of our customers are not obligated to buy our products or utilize our services for an extended period or at all.. <U+FEFF>. Low commodity price environments can negatively impact oil and natural gas E&P companies and, in some cases, impair their ability to timely pay for products or services provided or can result in their insolvency or bankruptcy, any of which exposes us to credit risk of our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers.. In weak economic and commodity price environments, we may experience difficulties, delays or failures in collecting outstanding receivables from our customers, due to, among other reasons, a reduction in their cash flow from operations, their inability to access the credit markets and, in certain cases, their insolvencies. Such collection issues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. To the extent one or more of our key customers commences bankruptcy proceedings, our contracts with these customers may be subject to rejection under applicable provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code, or may be renegotiated. Further, during any such bankruptcy proceeding, prior to assumption, rejection or renegotiation of such contracts, the bankruptcy court may temporarily authorize the payment of value for our services less than contractually required, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business,  financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. A single customer constituted 14%, 26% and 31% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the loss of that customer or any other of our significant customers, or their failure to pay the amounts they owe us, could cause our revenue to decline substantially.. <U+FEFF>. Our largest customer is Crescent Point which accounted for approximately 14%, 26% and 31% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additionally, our top five customers accounted for approximately 30%, 49% and 44% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. It is likely that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from these customers in the near future. If any of these customers decided not to continue to use our products and services, our revenue would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our customer base. Any nonperformance by these customers, including their failure to pay the amounts they owe us, either as a result of changes in general financial and economic conditions, conditions in the oil and natural gas industry or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. We may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of increasing sales of our products and services for use in basins located in the United States.. <U+FEFF>. A  key component of our growth strategy is to increase our market share in the United States. Our products and services enable pinpoint stimulation of an oil or natural gas well. Currently, most E&P companies in the United States rely on traditional well completion techniques and do not utilize pinpoint stimulation. We may not be successful in convincing potential customers of the benefits of our technologies relative to traditional well completion techniques. If we are unable to convince potential customers in the United States of the benefits of our pinpoint stimulation, we will not be able to execute on our strategy to increase the level of sales of our products and services in the United States, which could harm our growth prospects. Additionally, the sales of our products and services depend in large part on the perception of pinpoint stimulation in the oil and natural gas industry. Events that would harm the perception of pinpoint stimulation, including unfavorable industry reports or poor well performance for wells that were completed using pinpoint stimulation could impact our ability to grow our U.S. sales, which could harm our growth prospects.. <U+FEFF>. 15. Table of Contents. Competition within our industry may adversely affect our ability to market our services.. <U+FEFF>. The markets in which we operate are generally highly competitive. The principal competitive factors in our market are technology, service quality, safety track record and price. We compete with large national and multi-national companies that have substantially longer operating histories, greater financial, technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do. Several of our competitors provide a broader array of services and have a stronger presence in more geographic markets. In addition, we compete with several smaller companies capable of competing effectively on a regional or local basis. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, products and services and changes in customer requirements. In certain circumstances, work is awarded on a bid basis, which further increases competition based on price. Pricing is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded the work. The competitive environment may be further intensified by mergers and acquisitions among oil and natural gas companies or other events that have the effect of reducing the number of available customers. As a result of competition, we may lose market share or be unable to maintain or increase prices for our present services or to acquire additional business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Advancements in drilling and well completion technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. Our industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As new well completion technologies develop, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressure may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost. We may not be able to successfully acquire or use new technologies. New technologies, services or standards, including improvements to existing competing technologies, could render our technologies, products or services obsolete, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the development of new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing altogether or that replace our technologies, could cause a decline in the demand for the products and services that we provide and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. We often have long sales cycles, which can result in significant time between initial contact with a prospective customer and sales of our products and services to that customer, making it difficult to project when, if at all, we will obtain new customers and when we will generate revenue from those customers.. <U+FEFF>. Our sales cycle, from initial contact to sales of our products and services to a customer can take significant time. Our sales efforts involve educating our customers about the use, technical capabilities and benefits of our completion technologies. Some of our customers undertake an evaluation process that frequently involves not only our technology but also the offerings of our competitors. As a result, it is difficult to predict when we will obtain new customers and begin generating revenue from these new customers. As a result, we may not be able to add customers, or generate revenue, as quickly as we may expect, which could harm our growth prospects.. <U+FEFF>. Our success depends on our ability to develop and implement new technologies, products and services.. <U+FEFF>. Our success depends on the ongoing development and implementation of new product designs and improvements, and on our ability to protect and maintain critical intellectual property assets related to these developments. If we are not able to obtain patent or other intellectual property protection of our technology, we may not be able to recoup development costs or fully exploit systems, services and technologies in a manner that allows us to meet evolving industry requirements at prices acceptable to our customers. In addition, some of our competitors are large national and multinational companies that may be able to devote greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources to research and development of new systems, services and technologies than we are able to do.. <U+FEFF>. Investments in new technologies involve uncertainties and risk. Commercial success depends on many factors, including the levels of innovation, the development costs and the availability of capital resources to fund those costs, the levels of competition from others developing similar or other competing technologies, our ability to obtain or maintain government permits or certifications, the effectiveness of production, distribution and marketing efforts, and the costs to customers to deploy and provide support for the new technologies. We may not achieve significant revenues from new product and service investments for a number of years, if at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. 16. Table of Contents. Most of our revenue generated is denominated in the Canadian dollar and could be negatively impacted by currency fluctuations.. <U+FEFF>. Because approximately 63% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was generated in Canada, we could be materially affected by currency fluctuations. Changes in currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the Canadian dollar (\"CAD\"), could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. As we have a trade accounts receivable balance in Canadian dollars of $27.3 million CAD as of December 31, 2017 a 10% increase in the strength of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar would result in an increase in pre-tax income of $2.0 million. Conversely, a corresponding decrease in the strength of the Canadian dollar would have resulted in a comparable decrease in pre-tax income. We have not hedged our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and, as a result, could incur significant and unanticipated translation gains and losses.. <U+FEFF>. Our operations may be limited or disrupted in certain parts of the continental United States and Canada during severe weather conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. We provide products and services to E&P companies that operate in basins throughout the continental United States and Canada. We serve these markets through our facilities and service centers located in Texas, Oklahoma, Montana, West Virginia and Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada. A substantial portion of our revenue is generated from our operations in geographies where weather conditions may be severe, particularly during winter and spring months. Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcurtailment of drilling and completion activity;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tweather-related damage to equipment resulting in suspension of operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tweather-related damage to our facilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinability to deliver equipment and materials to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of productivity.. <U+FEFF>. Many municipalities impose bans or other restrictions on the use of roads and highways, which include weight restrictions on the paved roads that lead to our jobsites due to the muddy conditions caused by spring thaws. This can limit our access to these jobsites and our ability to service wells in these areas. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs in those regions. Weather conditions may also affect the price of crude oil and natural gas, and related demand for our services. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Hydraulic fracturing is substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on the ability of our customers to obtain water may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Water is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Over the past several years, certain of the areas in which we sell our products and services have experienced extreme drought conditions and competition for water in such shales is growing. As a result of this severe drought, some local water districts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply. The inability of our customers to obtain water to use in their operations from local sources or to effectively utilize flowback water could impact demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. 17. Table of Contents. The growth of our business through acquisitions or strategic partnerships exposes us to various risks, including identifying suitable opportunities and integrating businesses, assets and personnel.. <U+FEFF>. We completed the acquisition of Spectrum in 2017 (the \"Spectrum Acquisition\") and we expect to pursue future acquisitions in order to expand and diversify our business. We may also form strategic partnerships with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. We may not be able to identify any potential acquisition or strategic partnership candidates, consummate any acquisitions or enter into any strategic partnerships and any future acquisitions or strategic partnerships may not be successfully integrated or may not be advantageous to us. In addition, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient capital resources to complete any acquisitions. Entities we acquire may not achieve the revenue and earnings we anticipate or their liabilities may exceed our expectations. We could face integration issues pertaining to the internal controls and operational functions of the acquired companies and we also could fail to realize cost efficiencies or synergies that we anticipated when selecting our acquisition candidates. Client dissatisfaction or performance problems with a particular acquired entity or resulting from a strategic partnership could have a material adverse effect on our reputation as a whole. We may be unable to profitably manage any acquired entities, or we may fail to integrate them successfully without incurring substantial expenses, delays or other problems. We may not achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions or any of the strategic partnerships we form. In addition, business acquisitions, including the Spectrum Acquisition, and strategic partnerships involve a number of risks that could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, including but not limited to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to integrate operational, accounting and technology policies, processes and systems and the implementation of those policies and procedures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to integrate personnel and human resources systems as well as the cultures of each of the acquired businesses;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to implement our business plan for the acquired business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttransition of operations, users and clients to our existing platforms or the integration of data, systems and technology platforms with ours;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompliance with regulatory requirements and avoiding potential conflicts of interest in markets that we serve;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiversion of management's attention and other resources;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to retain or replace key personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to maintain relationships with the customers of the acquired business or a strategic partner and further develop the acquired business or the business of our strategic partner;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to cross-sell our products and services of the acquired businesses or strategic partners to our respective clients;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tentry into unfamiliar markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tassumption of unanticipated legal or financial liabilities and/or negative publicity related to prior acts by the acquired entity;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, clients, former stockholders or third parties;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmisuse of intellectual property by our strategic partners;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisagreements with strategic partners or a misalignment of incentives within any strategic partnership;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbecoming subject to increased regulation or a result of an acquisition;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbecoming significantly leveraged as a result of incurring debt to finance an acquisition;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunanticipated operating, accounting or management difficulties in connection with the acquired entities; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timpairment of acquired intangible assets, including goodwill, and dilution to our earnings per share.. <U+FEFF>. If we fail to successfully integrate the businesses that we acquire or strategic partnerships that we enter into, we may not realize any of the benefits we anticipate in connection with the acquisitions or partnerships, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. 18. Table of Contents. If we are unable to accurately predict customer demand or if customers cancel their orders on short notice, we may hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce gross margins. Conversely, insufficient inventory would result in lost revenue opportunities and potentially in loss of market share and damaged customer relationships.. <U+FEFF>. Customers can generally cancel or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a significant penalty. As a result, we cannot accurately predict what or how many products such customers will need in the future. Anticipating demand is difficult because our customers face unpredictable demand for their own products and are increasingly focused on cash preservation and tighter inventory management.. <U+FEFF>. Orders are placed with our suppliers based on forecasts of customer demand and, in some instances, we may establish buffer inventories to accommodate anticipated demand. Our forecasts of customer demand are based on multiple assumptions, each of which may introduce errors into the estimates. If we overestimate customer demand, we may allocate resources to the purchase of material or manufactured products that we may not be able to sell when we expect to, if at all. As a result, we would hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce gross margin and adversely affect financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available, we would miss revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships. In addition, any future significant cancellations or deferrals of product orders or the return of previously sold products could materially and adversely affect profit margins, increase product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations.. <U+FEFF>. Our products are used in operations that are subject to potential hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, including claims for personal injury and property damage, and, as a result, we are exposed to potential liabilities that may affect our financial condition and reputation.. <U+FEFF>. Our products are used in potentially hazardous drilling, completion and production applications in the oil and natural gas industry where an accident or a failure of a product can potentially have catastrophic consequences. Risks inherent to these applications, such as equipment malfunctions and failures, equipment misuse and defects, explosions, blowouts and uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids and natural disasters can cause personal injury, loss of life, suspension of operations, damage to formations, damage to facilities, business interruption and damage to or destruction of property, surface water and drinking water resources, equipment and the environment. If our products or services fail to meet specifications or are involved in accidents or failures, we could face warranty, contract or other litigation claims, which could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, pollution and other environmental damages. We operate with most of our customers under MSAs. We endeavor to allocate potential liabilities and risks between the parties in MSAs, which may result in material liability to us. In addition, despite our intention to generally allocate risk under MSAs, we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation, might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation or may be required to enter into an MSA with terms that are unfavorable to us. As a result, we may incur substantial losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, the frequency and severity of such incidents will affect operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators. In particular, our customers may elect not to purchase our services if they view our safety record as unacceptable, which could cause us to lose customers and substantial revenues. In addition, these risks may be greater for us because we may acquire companies that have not allocated significant resources and management focus to safety and have a poor safety record requiring rehabilitative efforts during the integration process and we may incur liabilities for losses before such rehabilitation occurs.. <U+FEFF>. Losses and liabilities from uninsured or underinsured drilling and operating activities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.. <U+FEFF>. Our insurance policies may not be adequate to cover all liabilities. Further, insurance may not be generally available in the future or, if available, insurance premiums may make such insurance commercially unjustifiable. Moreover, even if we are successful in defending a claim, it could be time-consuming and costly to defend. The operational insurance coverage we maintain for our business may not fully insure us against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs relative to perceived risk. Further, any insurance obtained by us may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities and this insurance may not continue to be available at all or on terms which are acceptable to us. Insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuation and changes in coverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost or higher deductibles and retentions. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. 19. Table of Contents. Our competitors may infringe upon, misappropriate, violate or challenge the validity or enforceability of our intellectual property and we may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in the future.. <U+FEFF>. We currently hold multiple U.S. and international patents and have multiple pending patent applications for products and processes. Patent rights give the owner of a patent the right to exclude third parties from making, using, selling, and offering for sale the inventions claimed in the patents in the applicable country. Patent rights do not necessarily grant the owner of a patent the right to practice the invention claimed in a patent, but merely the right to exclude others from practicing the invention claimed in the patent. It may be possible for a third-party to design around our patents. Furthermore, patent rights have strict territorial limits. We may not be able to enforce our patents against infringement occurring in \"non-covered\" territories. Also, we do not have patents in every jurisdiction in which we conduct business and our patent portfolio will not protect all aspects of our business and may relate to obsolete or unusual methods, which would not prevent third parties from entering the same market.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, by customarily entering into employment, confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers and potential customers and suppliers, we attempt to limit access to and distribution of our technology. Our rights in our confidential information, trade secrets, and confidential know-how will not prevent third parties from independently developing similar information. Publicly available information (e.g. information in expired issued patents, published patent applications, and scientific literature) can also be used by third parties to independently develop technology. This independently developed technology may be equivalent or superior to our proprietary technology.. <U+FEFF>. Confidential information shared with employees, customers and potential customers and suppliers may be used by those parties in a manner inconsistent with their employment, confidentiality and/or license agreements and we may not be able to adequately protect against or stop such behavior. We may not be able to determine if competitive technology offered by third parties was independently developed or resulted from breach of our agreements. When we do become aware of breaches, we may become involved in legal proceedings from time to time to protect our legal interests and enforce such agreements.. <U+FEFF>. We may be adversely affected by disputes regarding intellectual property rights and the value of our intellectual property rights is uncertain.. <U+FEFF>. As discussed above, we may become involved in legal proceedings from time to time to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. Third parties from time to time may initiate litigation against us by asserting that the conduct of our business infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates intellectual property rights. We may not prevail in any such legal proceedings related to such claims, and our products and services may be found to infringe, impair, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others. If we are sued for infringement and lose, we could be required to pay substantial damages and/or be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology. Any legal proceeding concerning intellectual property could be protracted and costly and is inherently unpredictable and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation, regardless of its outcome.. <U+FEFF>. Further, our intellectual property rights may not have the value that management believes them to have and such value may change over time as we and others develop new product designs and improvements.. <U+FEFF>. The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for oil and natural gas.. <U+FEFF>. In recent years, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of GHGs. The EPA has finalized a series of GHG monitoring, reporting and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry. For example, in October 2015, the EPA finalized rules adding new sources to the scope of the GHG monitoring and reporting rule. These new sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers of hydraulically fractured wells. More recently, in June 2016, the EPA published final rules establishing new and more stringent methane and VOCs emissions control requirements for oil and natural gas development and production operations. However, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposal to stay the implementation of certain requirements while it reconsiders the rules. These rules have also been the subject of litigation. As a result, the future implementation of these rules remains uncertain.. <U+FEFF>. While Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs. In addition, in December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake \"ambitious efforts\" to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Paris Agreement, which entered into force on November 4, 2016, establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce GHG emissions. The direction of future U.S. climate change regulation is difficult to predict given the current uncertainties surrounding the policies of the Trump Administration. The EPA may or may not continue. 20. Table of Contents. developing regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and natural gas industry. Even if federal efforts in this area slow, states may continue pursuing climate regulations.. <U+FEFF>. Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry by reducing demand for hydrocarbons and by making it more expensive to develop and produce hydrocarbons, either of which could have a material adverse effect on future demand for our products and services. At this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our or our customers' business.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that GHG emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against certain energy companies and could allege personal injury or property damages. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our or our customers' operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Moreover, climate change may cause more extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels and increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our or our customers' operations and increase our costs, and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations.. <U+FEFF>. Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays on our customers which could in turn decrease the demand for our products and services.. <U+FEFF>. Our business is dependent on the ability of our customers to conduct hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling activities. Hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand and other proppants under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process and there are certain governmental reviews either completed, underway, or being proposed that focus on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. These completed, ongoing, or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and whether any meaningful results are obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released a final report assessing the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. In this report, the EPA found scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. State and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and natural gas waste disposal and seismic activity. Similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. Regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and natural gas activity and induced seismicity. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing, and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly to perform fracturing and increase the costs of compliance and doing business for our customers. In addition, in response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have from time to time, developed and implemented plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. Such actions to restrict or suspend disposal well operations could make it more difficult or costly for our customers to perform fracturing.. <U+FEFF>. Various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. For instance, the State of New York elected in 2015 to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether. Any increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could reduce our customers' demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal, state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing.. <U+FEFF>. 21. Table of Contents. We may not be able to meet applicable regulatory requirements for our use of certain chemicals by our recently acquired tracer diagnostics business, and, even if requirements are met, complying on an ongoing basis with the numerous regulatory requirements will be time-consuming and costly.. The chemicals that we use in our recently acquired tracer diagnostics business may be subject to government regulation in our target markets. In the United States, the EPA administers the Toxic Substances Control Act (the \"TSCA\") which regulates the commercial registration, distribution, and use of many chemicals, including the chemicals we use in our tracer diagnostics business. Before we can manufacture or distribute significant volumes of a chemical, we need to determine whether that chemical is listed in the TSCA inventory. If the substance is listed, then manufacture or distribution can commence immediately. If not, then we must file a Pre-Manufacture Notice (\"PMN\") with the EPA for review. Certain categories of chemical substances may be exempt from a full PMN review, including chemical substances that qualify for a Low Volume Exemption (\"LVE\"). We have filed PMNs for certain chemicals, and have sought for and obtained LVEs for other chemicals that we use in our tracer diagnostics business, and we may file additional PMNs or seek additional LVEs in the future. We may not be able to expediently receive approval from the EPA to list such chemicals on the TSCA inventory, resulting in delays in our ability to manufacture such chemicals, or significant increases in testing requirements.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, even once we have a consent order from the EPA allowing us to manufacture PMN substances for our tracer diagnostics business, we remain subject to numerous regulatory requirements, including, as applicable, volume limitations that may impede us from producing sufficient quantities of such chemicals. Noncompliance with an EPA consent order could result in civil or criminal penalties and delays, or require us to cease operations that are authorized under the consent order. Similar programs exist in most, if not all, of the countries in which we may seek to produce, import or use certain chemicals in our tracer diagnostics business, including compliance with regulations imposed in Canada by the Environment and Climate Change Canada/Health Canada. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain necessary approvals in a timely manner or at all. If we do not meet applicable regulatory requirements in a particular country for some chemicals, then we may not be able to commercialize those chemicals or tracers in such country, and our business could be adversely affected. Changes in regulatory requirements, laws and policies, or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements, laws and policies, may result in increased compliance costs, delays, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results.. <U+FEFF>. Our operations and our customers' operations are subject to a variety of governmental laws and regulations that may increase our costs, limit the demand for our products and services or restrict our operations.. <U+FEFF>. Our business and our customers' businesses may be significantly affected by:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfederal, state and local and non-U.S. laws and other regulations relating to import tariffs, oilfield operations, worker safety and protection of the environment;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in these laws and regulations; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of enforcement of these laws and regulations.. <U+FEFF>. If we fail to comply with safety regulations or maintain an acceptable level of safety at our facilities we may incur fines, penalties or other liabilities, or may be held criminally liable. We may incur additional costs to upgrade equipment or conduct additional training, or otherwise incur costs in connection with compliance with safety regulations. Failure to maintain safe operations or achieve certain safety performance metrics could disqualify us from doing business with certain customers, particularly major oil companies.. <U+FEFF>. We depend on the demand for our products and services from the oil and natural gas industry which is affected by changing taxes, price controls and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry in general. For example, the adoption of laws and regulations curtailing exploration and development drilling for oil and natural gas for economic or other policy reasons could adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our products. In addition, some non-U.S. countries may adopt regulations or practices that give advantage to indigenous oil companies in bidding for oil leases, or require indigenous companies to perform oilfield services currently supplied by international service companies. To the extent that such companies are not our customers, or we are unable to develop relationships with them, our business may suffer. We cannot determine the extent to which our future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing regulations.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, the prices we pay for raw materials used in our products may be impacted by tariffs. On March 8, 2018, the Trump Administration signed an order that will impose an import tariff of 25% on steel. As a result of this tariff, if we are unable to obtain raw materials, including steel, at historical prices, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. 22. Table of Contents. Because of our non-U.S. operations and sales, we are subject to changes in regional, political or economic conditions, and non-U.S. laws and policies, including taxes, trade protection measures, and changes in regulatory requirements governing the operations of companies in non-U.S. countries. We are also subject to changes in non-U.S. laws and regulations that may encourage or require hiring of local contractors or require non-U.S. contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. If we fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, it could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. We could be  subject to additional income tax liabilities.. <U+FEFF>. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state), Canada and other foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies, changes to our existing businesses and operations, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments and how they are financed, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations. In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation. Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017 Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. The 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. As we complete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance, we may make adjustments to amounts that we have recorded that may impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.. <U+FEFF>. We are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods.. <U+FEFF>. Loss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business.. <U+FEFF>. We are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer based programs, including our engineering information and accounting data. If any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, whether due to cyber-attack or otherwise, possible consequences include our loss of communication links and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. We are subject to cyber security risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.. <U+FEFF>. The oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain processing activities. For example, we depend on digital technologies to perform many of our services and process and record financial and operating data. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased. The United States government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. Our technologies, systems and networks, and those of our customers, vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of its business operations.. <U+FEFF>. 23. Table of Contents. Our databases and systems, as well as those of our third-party vendors, have been, and likely will continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing and other cyber-attacks. We also face risks associated with new personnel, as well as with new processes and technologies which are implemented from time to time to augment our security and privacy management programs. To date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks, however, we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third-party vendors will prevent breaches or breakdowns to our or their databases or systems. If our security measures or those of the third-party vendors we use who have access to this information are inadequate or are breached as a result of third party action, employee error, malfeasance, malware, phishing, hacking attacks, system error, trickery or otherwise, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to sensitive information on our systems or our providers' systems, our reputation and business could be damaged. We cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns to our or our third-party vendors' databases or systems.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. As cyber incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. Our insurance coverage for cyberattacks may not be sufficient to cover all the losses we may experience as a result of such cyberattacks.. <U+FEFF>. Our business operations in countries outside of the United States are subject to a number of U.S. federal laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") and the Commerce Department.. <U+FEFF>. Local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the United States. In many countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us. The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, including the UK Bribery Act 2010, prohibit corporations and individuals, including us and our employees, from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. We are responsible for any violations by our employees, contractors and agents, whether based within or outside of the United States, for violations of the FCPA. We may also be held responsible for any violations by an acquired company that occur prior to an acquisition, or subsequent to the acquisition but before we are able to institute our compliance procedures. In addition, our non-U.S. competitors that are not subject to the FCPA or similar laws may be able to secure business or other preferential treatment in such countries by means that such laws prohibit with respect to us. A violation of any of these laws, even if prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation. Actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation, be expensive to defend, and impair our ability to do business.. <U+FEFF>. Compliance with U.S. regulations on trade sanctions and embargoes administered by OFAC also poses a risk to us. We cannot provide products or services to certain countries subject to U.S. trade sanctions. Furthermore, the laws and regulations concerning import activity, export recordkeeping and reporting, export control and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory trading obligations could result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines, imprisonment, debarment from governmental contracts, seizure of shipments and loss of import and export privileges.. <U+FEFF>. We may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Any significant growth, if achieved, could place a significant strain on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. As we expand the scope of our activities and our geographic coverage through organic growth, acquisitions and strategic partnerships, there will be additional demands on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial control systems or the occurrences of unexpected expansion difficulties, including the failure to recruit and retain experienced managers, engineers and other professionals, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Our success may depend on the continued service and availability of key personnel.. <U+FEFF>. Our success and future growth is dependent upon the ability of our executive officers, senior managers and other key personnel to operate and manage our business and execute on our growth strategies successfully. We may be unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers, senior managers or other key personnel. We may incur increased expenses in connection with the hiring, promotion, retention or replacement of any of these individuals. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. 24. Table of Contents. We may be unable to attract and retain skilled and technically knowledgeable employees, which could adversely affect our business.. <U+FEFF>. Our success and future growth is dependent upon attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals and other technical personnel. A number of our employees are highly skilled engineers, geologists and highly trained technicians, and our failure to continue to attract and retain such individuals could adversely affect our ability to compete in the oilfield services industry. We may confront significant and potentially adverse competition for these skilled and technically knowledgeable personnel, particularly during periods of increased demand for oil and natural gas. Additionally, at times there may be a shortage of skilled and technical personnel available in the market, potentially compounding the difficulty of attracting and retaining these employees. If we are unable to recruit or retain sufficient skilled and technical personnel it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Unionization efforts could increase our costs or limit our flexibility.. <U+FEFF>. Presently, none of our employees work under collective bargaining agreements. Unionization efforts have been made from time to time within our industry, to varying degrees of success. Any such unionization could increase our costs or limit our flexibility, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Restrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect the ability of our customers to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.. <U+FEFF>. Oil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife, which may limit the ability of our customers to operate in protected areas. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. Additionally, the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we operate could result in increased costs arising from species protection measures. Restrictions on the oil and natural gas operations of our customers to protect wildlife could reduce demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. We are subject to the risk of supplier concentration.. <U+FEFF>. Certain of our product lines depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers and vendors. As a result of this concentration in some of our supply chains, our business and operations could be negatively affected if our key suppliers were to experience significant disruptions affecting the price, quality, availability or timely delivery of their products. The partial or complete loss of any one of our key suppliers, or a significant adverse change in the relationship with any of these suppliers, through consolidation or otherwise, may limit our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products.. <U+FEFF>. We may not be able to satisfy technical requirements, testing requirements, code requirements or other specifications under contracts and contract tenders.. <U+FEFF>. Many of our products could be used in harsh environments and severe service applications. Our contracts with customers and customer requests for bids may set forth detailed specifications or technical requirements (including that they meet certain industrial code requirements, such as API, ASME or similar codes, or that our processes and facilities maintain ISO or similar certifications) for our products and services, which may also include extensive testing requirements. We anticipate that such code testing requirements will become more common in our contracts. We cannot assure you that our products or facilities will be able to satisfy the specifications or requirements, or that we will be able to perform the full-scale testing necessary to prove that the product specifications are satisfied in future contract bids or under existing contracts, or that the costs of modifications to our products or facilities to satisfy the specifications and testing will not adversely affect our results of operations. If our products or facilities are unable to satisfy such requirements, or we are unable to perform or satisfy any scale testing, our customers may cancel their contracts and/or seek new suppliers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness. <U+FEFF>. We are a holding company and rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations.. <U+FEFF>. We are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations. The agreements governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries impose restrictions on our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us. The deterioration of the earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries for any reason also could limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us.. 25. Table of Contents. <U+FEFF>. Our outstanding indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business, and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations.. <U+FEFF>. As of December 31, 2017, our total outstanding indebtedness was $27.0 million, including $20.0 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have important consequences for us, including, without limitation, that:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour indebtedness and leverage may increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions, as well as to competitive pressures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and for general corporate and other purposes may be limited;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpose us to the risk of increased interest rates because our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise or successfully carrying out our plans to expand our business; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry may be limited.. <U+FEFF>. Under the terms of the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility, we are required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants, which may limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it. The obligations under our Senior Secured Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default, which includes customary events of default including, without limitation, payment defaults, cross-defaults to certain material indebtedness, covenant defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, bankruptcy events, material judgments, certain ERISA-related events, material defects with respect to guarantees and collateral, invalidity of subordination provisions and change of control. If not cured, an event of default could result in any amounts outstanding, including any accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable, which would require us to, among other things: seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets, refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, sell selected assets and/or reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and any such financing or refinancing might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations or are forced to take additional measures to be able to service our indebtedness, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial indebtedness.. <U+FEFF>. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the terms of the agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility contains restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions, and indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If we and our subsidiaries incur significant additional indebtedness, the related risks to our financial condition could increase.. <U+FEFF>. Restrictive covenants in the agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.. <U+FEFF>. The agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. These include covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur additional indebtedness;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgrant liens;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into burdensome agreements with negative pledge clauses or restrictions on subsidiary distributions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake certain investments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpay dividends;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake payments in respect of junior lien or subordinated debt;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconsolidate, amalgamate, merge, liquidate or dissolve;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets;. 26. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake certain organizational changes (including with respect to organizational documents and changes in fiscal year);.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tengage in sale-leaseback transactions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tengage in transactions with affiliates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into operating leases;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into hedging arrangements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into certain leasehold arrangements and arrangements with respect to inventory and equipment;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmaterially alter our business; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur capital expenditures.. <U+FEFF>. Our Senior Secured Credit Facility contains financial covenants that require (i) commencing with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017, compliance with a leverage ratio test set at (A) 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending prior to March 31, 2018 and (B) 2.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter ending on or after March 31, 2018, (ii) commencing with the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017, compliance with an interest coverage ratio test set at 2.75 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, (iii) if the leverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter is greater than 2.00 to 1.00 and the amount outstanding under the Canadian Facility at any time during such fiscal quarter was greater than $0, compliance as of the end of such fiscal quarter with a Canadian asset coverage ratio test set at 1.00 to 1.00 and (iv) if the leverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter is greater than 2.00 to 1.00 and the amount outstanding under the U.S. Facility at any time during such fiscal quarter was greater than $0, compliance as of the end of such fiscal quarter with a U.S. asset coverage ratio test set at 1.00 to 1.00. Our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these ratios. A breach of any covenant or restriction contained in the agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility could result in an event of default under this agreement. If any such event of default occurs, the lenders under the facility, may elect (after the expiration of any applicable notice or grace periods) to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, also have the right upon an event of default thereunder to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. Further, following an event of default under the agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility, the lenders under the facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt. If the debt under our Senior Secured Credit Facility was to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that debt or any other debt that may become due as a result of that acceleration.. <U+FEFF>. Volatility and weakness in bank and capital markets may adversely affect credit availability and related financing costs for us.. <U+FEFF>. Bank and capital markets can experience periods of volatility and disruption. If the disruption in these markets is prolonged, our ability to refinance, and the related cost of refinancing, some or all of our debt could be adversely affected. Additionally, during periods of volatile credit markets, there is a risk that lenders, even those with strong balance sheets and sound lending practices, could fail or refuse to honor their legal commitments and obligations under existing credit commitments, including our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Although we currently can access the bank and capital markets, there is no assurance that such markets will continue to be a reliable source of financing for us. These factors, including the tightening of credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to obtain cost-effective financing. Increased volatility and disruptions in the financial markets also could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to refinance outstanding indebtedness and obtain financing. In addition, the adoption of new statutes and regulations, the implementation of recently enacted laws or new interpretations or the enforcement of older laws and regulations applicable to the financial markets or the financial services industry could result in a reduction in the amount of available credit or an increase in the cost of credit. Disruptions in the financial markets can also adversely affect our lenders, insurers, customers and other counterparties. Any of these results could results in a material adverse effect to our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock. <U+FEFF>. The price of our common stock may be volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment.. <U+FEFF>. Securities markets worldwide have experienced in the past, and are likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations. Specifically, the oilfield services sector has recently experienced significant market volatility. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our results of operations. The trading price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, including, among other things, the risk factors described herein and other factors beyond our control. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock could include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmarket conditions in the broader stock market;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly financial and operating results;. 27. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelopments in the oil and natural gas industry in general or in the oil and natural gas services market in particular;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvariations in operating results of similar companies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tintroduction of new services by us, our competitors or our customers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tissuance of new, negative or changed securities analysts' reports, recommendations or estimates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinvestor perceptions of us and the industries in which we or our customers operate;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsales, or anticipated sales, of our stock, including sales by our officers, directors and significant stockholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadditions or departures of key personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory or political developments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe public's response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements media reports or other public forum comments related to litigation, claims or reputational charges against us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tguidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinvestor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother events or factors, including those resulting from system failures and disruptions, earthquakes, hurricanes, war, acts of terrorism, other natural disasters or responses to these events;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in accounting principles;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshare-based compensation expense under applicable accounting standards;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlitigation and governmental investigations; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanging economic conditions.. <U+FEFF>. These and other factors may cause the market price and demand for shares of our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock sometimes have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. Securities litigation against us, regardless of the merits or outcome, could result in substantial costs and divert the time and attention of our management from our business, which could significantly harm our business, profitability and reputation.. <U+FEFF>. We are controlled by the Advent Funds, whose interests may differ from those of our public stockholders.. <U+FEFF>. We are controlled by funds (the \"Advent Funds\") managed by Advent International Corporation (\"Advent\"), which beneficially own in the aggregate 64.7% of the combined voting power of our common stock. As a result of this ownership, Advent will have effective control over the outcome of votes on all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to our charter and bylaws and other significant corporate transactions.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, persons associated with Advent currently serve on our board of directors (our \"Board\"). The interests of Advent may not always coincide with the interests of our other stockholders, and the concentration of effective control in Advent will limit other stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters. The concentration of ownership and voting power of Advent also may delay, defer or even prevent an acquisition by a third-party or other change of control and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without their support, even if such events are in the best interests of our other stockholders.. <U+FEFF>. Further, Advent may have an interest in having us pursue acquisitions, divestitures, financing or other transactions, including, but not limited to, the issuance of additional debt or equity and the declaration and payment of dividends, that, in its judgment, could enhance Advent's equity investments, even though such transactions may involve risk to us or to our creditors. Additionally, the Advent Funds may make investments in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us, or may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.. <U+FEFF>. Advent may take actions that our other stockholders do not view as beneficial, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cause the value of your investment to decline.. <U+FEFF>. 28. Table of Contents. Advent and our directors affiliated with Advent, with certain exceptions, do not have obligations to present business opportunities to us and may compete with us.. <U+FEFF>. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that Advent and our directors affiliated with Advent do not have any obligation to offer us an opportunity to participate in business opportunities presented to them even if the opportunity is one that we might reasonably have pursued (and therefore may be free to compete with us in the same business or similar businesses), and that, to the extent permitted by law, Advent and such directors, will not be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any duty by reason of any such activities.. <U+FEFF>. As a result, Advent or any of its managers, officers, directors, agents, stockholders, members, partners, affiliates and subsidiaries (other than us and our subsidiaries) will not be prohibited from investing in competing businesses or doing business with our clients. Therefore, we may be in competition with Advent and such persons or their respective affiliates, and we may not have knowledge of, or be able to pursue, transactions that could potentially be beneficial to us. Accordingly, we may lose certain corporate opportunities or suffer competitive harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation or prospects.. <U+FEFF>. Future sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, could cause the market price for our common stock to decline.. <U+FEFF>. We may sell additional shares of common stock in subsequent public offerings. As of March 7, 2018, we had 44,482,948 outstanding shares of our common stock and one outstanding share of preferred stock. We also have registered 7,645,071 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans and 2,000,000 registered shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan for U.S. Employees (the \"U.S. ESPP\") and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan for non-U.S. Employees (the \"Non-U.S. ESPP\"). Certain equity holders of NCS Multistage Inc. (Canada), our indirect subsidiary, also have an exchange right to convert shares of common stock of NCS Multistage Inc. (Canada) into 1,326,935 shares of common stock.. <U+FEFF>. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of our common stock for sale will have on the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales will occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.. <U+FEFF>. We have elected to take advantage of the \"controlled company\" exemption to the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.. <U+FEFF>. Because we qualify as a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies on NASDAQ Global Select Market (\"NASDAQ\"), we are not required to have a majority of our Board be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or a Board committee performing the Board nominating function. As permitted by our status as a controlled company, we may choose to change our Board composition, or the composition of the compensation, nominating and corporate governance committee. Accordingly, should the interests of the Advent Funds differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.. <U+FEFF>. Anti-takeover protections in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws or our contractual obligations may discourage or prevent a takeover of our company, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.. <U+FEFF>. Provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\"), could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or the replacement of our management or discourage a potential investor from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market value of our common stock, even if it would benefit our stockholders.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, our Board has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, in one or more series, to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series. The issuance of shares of preferred stock or the adoption of a stockholder rights plan may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares.. 29. Table of Contents. In addition, under the agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility, a change of control would cause an event of default to occur and the lenders under the facility would have the right to accelerate their loans, and if so accelerated, we would be required to repay all of our outstanding obligations under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. In addition, from time to time we may enter into contracts that contain change of control provisions that limit the value of, or even terminate, the contract upon a change of control. These change of control provisions may discourage a takeover of our company, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.. <U+FEFF>. The requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.. <U+FEFF>. As a publicly traded company, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we were not required to incur in the past, and will incur additional expenses after we cease to be an emerging growth company (to the extent that we take advantage of certain exceptions from reporting requirements that are available to us as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act). We are required to file with the SEC annual and quarterly information and other reports that are specified in Section 13 of the Exchange Act. We are also subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including the requirements of NASDAQ and certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose additional compliance obligations upon us. Among other things, as a public company:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe prepare and distribute periodic public reports and other stockholder communications in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws and applicable NASDAQ rules;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe roles and duties of our Board and committees of the Board are expanded;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe comply with more comprehensive financial reporting and disclosure compliance functions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe manage enhanced investor relations functions; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the activities listed above.. <U+FEFF>. These changes require a commitment of additional resources. Our internal resources may not be adequate to support our increased reporting obligations, and we may be unable to hire, train or retain necessary staff and may be reliant on engaging outside consultants or professionals to overcome our lack of resources. If our internal resources are inadequate, we are unable to engage outside consultants or are otherwise unable to fulfill our public company obligations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. The changes necessitated by becoming a public company require a significant commitment of resources and management oversight that has increased and may continue to increase our costs and might place a strain on our systems and resources. As a result, our management's attention might be diverted from other business concerns. If we are unable to offset these costs through other savings then it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, being a public company subject to these rules and regulations makes it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our Board or as executive officers.. <U+FEFF>. We are an \"emerging growth company\" and may elect to comply with reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.. <U+FEFF>. We are an emerging growth company and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, even if we choose to comply with certain of the greater obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth companies, we may avail ourselves of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.. <U+FEFF>. 30. Table of Contents. We will remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2022, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (ii) the date that we become a \"large accelerated filer\" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period, whether or not issued in a registered offering.. <U+FEFF>. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may result in material misstatements of our financial statements or cause to us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or fail to prevent fraud; which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our common stock.. <U+FEFF>. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we might not be able to report on our financial results accurately or prevent fraud; which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our common stock. Prior to our IPO, we were a private company and had limited accounting and financial reporting personnel and other resources with which to address our internal controls and procedures. In connection with the audit of our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which have not yet been remediated as of December 31, 2017. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.. <U+FEFF>. We determined that we did not design or maintain an effective control environment with a sufficient number of trained professionals with the appropriate level of accounting knowledge and experience to properly analyze, record and disclose accounting matters commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. This material weakness contributed to the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe did not design and maintain sufficient formal accounting policies and controls over income taxes. Specifically, we did not have controls designed to address the accuracy of income tax expense (benefit) and related consolidated balance sheet accounts, including deferred income taxes, as well as adequate procedures and controls to review the work of external experts engaged to assist in income tax matters related to our tax structure or to monitor the presentation and disclosure of income taxes..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe did not design and maintain sufficient formal accounting policies and controls over the presentation of the statement of cash flows. Specifically, we did not have controls designed to properly classify cash flows related to our foreign exchange gains (losses) associated with our foreign denominated debt and deferred financing costs related to our extinguishment of debt..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe did not design and maintain adequate controls to address segregation of duties related to journal entries and account reconciliations as certain accounting personnel have the ability to prepare and post journal entries, as well as reconcile accounts, without an independent review by someone other than the preparer. Specifically, our internal controls were not designed or operating effectively to evidence that journal entries were appropriately recorded or were properly reviewed for validity, accuracy and completeness.. <U+FEFF>. These material weaknesses resulted in the need to correct material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 prior to their issuance. Each of the material weaknesses described above or any newly identified material weakness could result in a misstatement of our accounts or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.. <U+FEFF>. 31. Table of Contents. We have begun to remediate and plan to further remediate these material weaknesses primarily by implementing additional review procedures within the accounting and finance department, hiring additional staff, implementing new software and, if appropriate, engaging external accounting experts with the appropriate knowledge to supplement our internal resources in our computation and review processes. These actions and planned actions are subject to ongoing management review and the oversight of our Board. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to our material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or to avoid potential future material weaknesses. In addition, neither our management nor an independent registered public accounting firm has ever performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act because no such evaluation has been required. Had we or our independent registered public accounting firm performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, additional material weaknesses may have been identified. If we are unable to successfully remediate our existing or any future material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or identify any additional material weaknesses that may exist, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, we may be unable to prevent fraud, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and our stock price may decline as a result. Additionally, our reporting obligations as a public company could place a strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future and may cause us to fail to timely achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting.. <U+FEFF>. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, subject to certain exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.. <U+FEFF>. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us, any director or our officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our certificate or our amended and restated by-laws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us, any director or our officers or employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our certificate described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision that will be contained in our certificate to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>"
