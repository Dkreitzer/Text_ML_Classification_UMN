[1] "ITEM 1A.              RISK FACTORS. We have identified the following additional risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. Our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business. 26. Table of Contents. operations. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations or financial condition could suffer, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock.. Risks Related to Our Financial Condition and Need for Additional Financing. We have incurred losses since inception, and we anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $561.6 million. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $30.4 million and we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our preclinical and clinical development activities and, if our development activities are successful, potentially seek regulatory approval of our product candidates. These losses, among other things, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders' equity and working capital.. Our current product candidate, enobosarm (GTx-024), will require significant additional clinical development, financial resources and personnel in order to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for this product candidate and to develop it and our other SARMs into commercially viable products. While we recently announced our Phase 2 clinical trial of enobosarm to treat women with ER positive, AR positive advanced breast cancer achieved its primary efficacy endpoint in both the 9 mg and 18 mg cohorts, after evaluating the breast cancer environment where the treatment paradigms are shifting to immunotherapies and/or combination therapies, we decided that the time and cost of conducting the necessary clinical trials for potential approval in this indication does not warrant development of enobosarm in this indication at this time. Accordingly, our current strategy is focused on, and our prospects are substantially dependent on, the further development of enobosarm for the treatment of postmenopausal women with stress urinary incontinence, or SUI. However, the development of enobosarm for the treatment of postmenopausal women with SUI is at an early stage, is subject to the substantial risk of failure inherent in the development of early-stage product candidates, and will require significant additional financial resources and personnel in order for such development to continue. Our preclinical evaluation of our selective androgen receptor degrader, or SARD, technology will require significant additional financial resources and personnel to continue our development of the program. Additionally, any further development of our preclinical evaluation of SARMs as a potential treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, is subject to our ability to enter into new collaborative arrangements or other strategic transactions with third parties with expertise in DMD and orphan drug indications. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing and commercializing small molecule drugs, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all. In addition, we do not expect to obtain any regulatory approvals to market any of our preclinical or clinical product candidates, including enobosarm, for the foreseeable future, and it is possible that none of our product candidates will ever receive any regulatory approvals.. We have funded our operations primarily through public offerings and private placements of our securities, as well as payments from our former collaborators. We also previously recognized product revenue from the sale of FARESTON®, the rights to which we sold to a third party in the third quarter of 2012. Currently, we have no ongoing collaborations for the development and commercialization of our product candidates, and as a result of the sale of our rights and certain assets related to FARESTON®, we also currently have no sources of revenue.. If we and/or any potential collaborators are unable to develop and commercialize our SARMs or SARD technology, if development is further delayed or is eliminated, or if sales revenue from any. 27. Table of Contents. SARM or SARD products upon receiving marketing approval, if ever, is insufficient, we may never become profitable and we will not be successful.. We will need to raise substantial additional capital and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our development programs and could cause us to discontinue our operations.. We will need to raise substantial additional capital to:. <U+0095> fund our operations and conduct clinical trials;    <U+0095> continue our research and development;    <U+0095> seek regulatory approval for our product candidates; and    <U+0095> commercialize our product candidates, if any such product candidates receive regulatory approval for commercial sale.. Based on our current business plan and assumptions, we estimate that our current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with interest thereon, will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. We have based this estimate on our current business plan and assumptions that may prove to be wrong. We could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect, and we could need additional funding sooner than currently anticipated. Also, our clinical trials may encounter technical, enrollment or other difficulties that could increase our development costs beyond our current estimates or delay our development timelines, and we could otherwise exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we expect. In any event, if we decide to undertake any further development of our SARMs or SARD technology beyond our ongoing clinical trials of enobosarm and preclinical development, we would need to obtain additional funding for such development, either through financing or by entering into collaborative, partnering or other strategic arrangements with third parties for such further development.. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:. <U+0095> the scope, rate of progress and cost of our preclinical and clinical development programs, including our ongoing and any future clinical trials of enobosarm;    <U+0095> the terms and timing of any potential collaborative, licensing and other strategic arrangements that we may establish;     <U+0095> the amount and timing of any licensing fees, milestone payments and royalty payments from potential collaborators, if any;     <U+0095> future clinical trial results;    <U+0095> the cost and timing of regulatory filings and/or approvals to commercialize our product candidates and any related restrictions, limitations, and/or warnings in the label of an approved product candidate;    <U+0095> the effect of competing technological and market developments; and. 28. Table of Contents. <U+0095> the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights, and the cost of defending any other litigation claims.. While we have been able to fund our operations to date, we have no ongoing collaborations for the development and commercialization of our product candidates and no source of revenue, nor do we expect to generate product revenue for the foreseeable future. We do not have any commitments for future external funding. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue, which we may never do, we expect to finance future cash needs through potential collaboration, partnering or other strategic arrangements, as well as through public or private equity offerings or debt financings or a combination of the foregoing. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may need to reduce our expenditures, perhaps significantly, to preserve our cash. Cost-cutting measures that we may take in the future may not be sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements, and they may negatively affect our business and growth prospects.. To the extent that we raise additional funds through potential collaborations, partnering or other strategic arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, any of which could result in the stockholders of GTx having little or no continuing interest in our SARMs and/or SARDs programs as stockholders or otherwise. To the extent we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. For example, we completed substantially dilutive private placements of our common stock and warrants in March 2014, November 2014 and September 2017, in addition to a registered direct offering of our common stock that we completed in October 2016. Our stockholders may experience additional, perhaps substantial, dilution should we again raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, including the issuance and sale of our common stock pursuant to our At-the-Market Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement, or sales agreement, with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, or Stifel. Any additional debt or equity financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. Our ability to raise additional funds and the terms upon which we are able to raise such funds may be adversely impacted by the uncertainty regarding the prospects of our development of enobosarm for the treatment of postmenopausal women with SUI and our ability to advance the development of enobosarm or SARDs through potential future collaborative, partnering or other strategic relationships, if at all. Our ability to raise additional funds and the terms upon which we are able to raise such funds may also be adversely affected by the uncertainties regarding our financial condition, the sufficiency of our capital resources, recent and potential future management turnover, and continued volatility and instability in the global financial markets. As a result of these and other factors, we cannot be certain that sufficient additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all.. Risks Related to Development of Product Candidates. We are substantially dependent on the success of enobosarm and our failure to advance the development of enobosarm or to obtain regulatory approval of enobosarm would significantly harm our prospects.. Our current strategy is focused on, and our prospects are substantially dependent on, the further development of enobosarm for the treatment of postmenopausal women with SUI. We are evaluating enobosarm for the treatment of postmenopausal women with SUI in two ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials. Even if our ongoing clinical trials are successful, we will still need to conduct costly and time-consuming additional clinical trials of enobosarm to determine whether enobosarm is a safe and effective treatment for postmenopausal women with SUI.. 29. Table of Contents. Preclinical studies, including studies of SARMs in animal models of disease, may not accurately predict the results of subsequent human clinical trials of enobosarm, including the results of our randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of enobosarm to evaluate the change in the mean number of daily SUI episodes following 12 weeks of treatment. Similarly, the fact that we reported positive top-line data from our Phase 2 open-label, non-placebo controlled, proof-of-concept clinical trial evaluating enobosarm in postmenopausal women with SUI does not ensure that our randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of enobosarm to evaluate the change in frequency of daily SUI episodes following 12 weeks of treatment will be successful. For example, even though we reported positive results from our Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial evaluating enobosarm 9 mg in women whose advanced breast cancer is both ER positive and AR positive, we determined during the third quarter of 2017 that there were insufficient patients achieving clinical benefit from enobosarm treatment to continue our Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial evaluating enobosarm in patients with advanced AR positive triple-negative breast cancer, or TNBC. Accordingly, we are in the process of closing down this Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial. Additionally, we have since decided not to pursue additional clinical development of enobosarm to treat women with ER positive, AR positive advanced breast cancer after evaluating the breast cancer environment where the treatment paradigms are shifting to immunotherapies and/or combination therapies, along with the time and cost of conducting the necessary clinical trials for potential approval, even though we recently announced our Phase 2 clinical trial of enobosarm in this indication achieved its primary efficacy endpoint in both the 9 mg and 18 mg cohorts of the clinical trial. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including us and those with greater resources and experience than we have, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase 3 and later-stage clinical trials, even after receiving encouraging results in earlier clinical trials. Due to the uncertain and time-consuming clinical development and regulatory approval process, we may not be successful in developing enobosarm for the treatment of postmenopausal women with SUI, or in developing or partnering any of our product candidates, and it is possible that none of our current product candidates will ever become commercial products.. A substantial portion of our efforts and expenditures have been devoted to enobosarm 3 mg, which was the subject of our POWER 1 and POWER 2 Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating enobosarm 3 mg for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. Enobosarm 3 mg is also the subject of our randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of enobosarm to evaluate the change in the mean number of daily SUI episodes following 12 weeks of treatment. We announced in August 2013 that our POWER 1 and POWER 2 Phase 3 clinical trials failed to meet the co-primary endpoints of lean body mass and physical function that were assessed statistically using responder analyses as required by the FDA. The failure of the POWER trials to meet the primary statistical criterion for the co-primary endpoints agreed upon with the FDA significantly depressed our stock price and has harmed our future prospects.. Our evaluation of our SARD program is at an early stage and to initiate and complete initial human clinical trials, we will require additional funding. In addition, any further development of SARMs as a potential treatment for DMD is subject to our ability to enter into new collaborative arrangements or other strategic transactions with third parties with expertise in DMD and orphan drug indications.. Accordingly, our current strategy and prospects are substantially dependent on the successful development of enobosarm for the treatment of postmenopausal women with SUI. If we are unable to successfully further the development of and obtain regulatory approval of enobosarm for the treatment of postmenopausal women with SUI, and to obtain the necessary funding to do so, our prospects would be significantly harmed and we might need to cease operations.. 30. Table of Contents. We and any potential collaborators will not be able to commercialize our product candidates if our preclinical studies do not produce successful results or if our clinical trials do not adequately demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans.. Significant additional clinical development and financial resources will be required to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for our product candidates and to develop them into commercially viable products. Preclinical and clinical testing is expensive, can take many years to complete and has an uncertain outcome. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. In this regard, from time to time, we have and may in the future publish or report interim or preliminary data from our clinical trials. Interim or preliminary data from clinical trials that we may conduct may not be indicative of the final results of the trial and are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Interim or preliminary data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the interim or preliminary data. As a result, interim or preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available.. Typically, the failure rate for development candidates is high. If a product candidate fails at any stage of development, we will not have the anticipated revenues from that product candidate to fund our operations, and we will not receive any return on our investment in that product candidate. For example, during the third quarter of 2017, we determined that there were insufficient patients achieving clinical benefit from enobosarm treatment to continue our Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial evaluating enobosarm in patients with advanced AR positive TNBC. Accordingly, we are in the process of closing down this clinical trial. Additionally, we have since decided not to pursue additional clinical development of enobosarm to treat women with ER positive, AR positive advanced breast cancer after evaluating the breast cancer environment where the treatment paradigms are shifting to immunotherapies and/or combination therapies, along with the time and cost of conducting the necessary clinical trials for potential approval, even though we recently announced our Phase 2 clinical trial of enobosarm in this indication achieved its primary efficacy endpoint in both the 9 mg and 18 mg cohorts of the clinical trial. In addition, we announced in August 2013 that our POWER 1 and POWER 2 Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating enobosarm for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with advanced NSCLC failed to meet the co-primary endpoints of lean body mass and physical function that were assessed statistically using responder analyses as agreed upon with the FDA.. In the first quarter of 2015, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with the University of Tennessee Research Foundation, or UTRF, to develop its proprietary SARD technology. However, our evaluation of the SARD program is at an early stage and it is possible that we may determine not to move forward with any meaningful preclinical development of our SARD program. Even if we do determine to move forward with any meaningful preclinical development of our SARD program, to initiate and complete initial human clinical trials, we will require additional funding. Accordingly, as a result of our unsuccessful research and preclinical development and/or our inability to obtain sufficient funding to meaningfully advance preclinical development of our SARD program, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our licensing of this program.. Significant delays in clinical testing could materially impact our product development costs. We do not know whether our ongoing clinical trials will need to be modified or will be completed on schedule, if at all. We or any potential collaborators may experience numerous unforeseen and/or adverse events. 31. Table of Contents. during, or as a result of, preclinical testing and the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent our or our potential collaborators' ability to commercialize our product candidates, including:. <U+0095> regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or any potential collaborators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site, or we may experience substantial delays in obtaining these authorizations;    <U+0095> preclinical or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, which may require us or any potential collaborators to conduct additional preclinical or clinical testing or to abandon projects that we expect to be promising;    <U+0095> even if preclinical or clinical trial results are positive, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could nonetheless require us to conduct unanticipated additional clinical trials;    <U+0095> registration or enrollment in clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate resulting in significant delays, additional costs and/or study terminations;    <U+0095> we or any potential collaborators may suspend or terminate clinical trials if the participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;    <U+0095> regulators or institutional review boards may suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements; and    <U+0095> our product candidates may not have the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects.. If any of these events were to occur and, as a result, we or any potential collaborators have significant delays in or termination of clinical trials, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be impaired, which would materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and growth prospects.. If we or any potential collaborators observe serious or other adverse events during the time our product candidates are in development or after our products are approved and on the market, we or any potential collaborators may be required to perform lengthy additional clinical trials, may be required to cease further development of such product candidates, may be denied regulatory approval of such products, may be forced to change the labeling of such products or may be required to withdraw any such products from the market, any of which would hinder or preclude our ability to generate revenues.. In our Phase 2 clinical trials for enobosarm for the treatment of muscle wasting in patients with cancer and healthy older males and postmenopausal females, we observed mild elevations of hepatic enzymes, which in certain circumstances may lead to liver failure, in a few patients in both the placebo and enobosarm treated groups. Reductions in high-density lipoproteins, or HDL, have also been observed in subjects treated with enobosarm. Lower levels of HDL could lead to increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Mild transient elevations in liver enzymes that were within normal limits were observed in our Phase 2 open-label, non-placebo controlled, proof-of-concept clinical trial of enobosarm to treat postmenopausal women with SUI, except for one patient with levels greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal which returned to normal following her 12-week treatment period. Reductions in total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins, or LDL, HDL and triglycerides were also observed. In addition, in our Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial evaluating enobosarm in a 9 mg daily dose for the treatment of patients with ER positive and AR positive metastatic breast cancer, bone pain of the chest cage, a serious adverse event, or SAE, was assessed as possibly related to enobosarm. Although doses up to 30 mg have been evaluated in short duration studies, doses of 1 mg,. 32. Table of Contents. 3 mg, 9 mg and 18 mg currently being tested in our ongoing longer duration Phase 2 clinical trials may increase the risk or incidence of known potential side effects of SARMs, including elevations in hepatic enzymes and further reductions in HDL, in addition to the emergence of side effects that have not been seen to date.. If the incidence of serious or other adverse events related to our product candidates increases in number or severity, if a regulatory authority believes that these or other events constitute an adverse effect caused by the drug, or if other effects are identified during clinical trials that we or any potential collaborators may conduct in the future or after any of our product candidates are approved and marketed:. <U+0095> we or any potential collaborators may be required to conduct additional preclinical or clinical trials, make changes in the labeling of any such approved products, reformulate any such products, or implement changes to or obtain new approvals of our contractors' manufacturing facilities;    <U+0095> regulatory authorities may be unwilling to approve our product candidates or may withdraw approval of our products;     <U+0095> we may experience a significant drop in the sales of the affected products;    <U+0095> our reputation in the marketplace may suffer; and    <U+0095> we may become the target of lawsuits, including class action suits.. Any of these events could prevent approval or harm sales of the affected product candidates or products, or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing any such products.. Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties. If we do not establish collaborations for our product candidates or otherwise raise substantial additional capital, we will likely need to alter, delay or abandon our development and any commercialization plans.. Our strategy includes selectively partnering, collaborating, or entering into other strategic arrangements with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to assist us in furthering development and potential commercialization of our product candidates and to provide funding for such activities. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators, and collaborations are complex and time consuming to negotiate and document. We may not be successful in entering into new collaborative, partnering or other strategic arrangements with third parties for the further development of our product candidates on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, we are unable to predict when, if ever, we will enter into any additional collaborative, partnering or other such strategic arrangements because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with establishing such arrangements, and we have otherwise been unsuccessful, for many years, in our efforts to establish such arrangements. If we are unable to negotiate new collaborative, partnering or other strategic arrangements with third parties for the further development of our product candidates, we may have to curtail the development of a particular product candidate, reduce, delay, or terminate its development or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of our sales or marketing activities or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. For example, we may have to cease further development of our enobosarm program if we are unable to raise sufficient funding for any additional. 33. Table of Contents. clinical development of enobosarm through new collaborative, partnering or other strategic arrangements with third parties or other financing alternatives. In this regard, if we decide to undertake any further development of our SARMs beyond our ongoing clinical trials and preclinical development, we would need to obtain additional funding for such development, either through financing or by entering into new collaborative, partnering or other strategic arrangements with third parties for any such further development. Likewise, to initiate and complete initial human clinical trials for our SARD program, we will require additional funding. In addition, any further development of SARMs as a potential treatment for DMD is subject to our ability to enter into new collaborative arrangements or other strategic transactions with third parties with expertise in DMD and orphan drug indications. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining additional funding in any event. If we are not able to raise substantial additional capital, either through financing or by entering into new collaborative, partnering or other strategic arrangements with third parties for the further development of our product candidates, we will not be able to advance the development of our product candidates or otherwise bring our product candidates to market and generate product revenues.. Any collaborative arrangements that we establish in the future may not be successful or we may otherwise not realize the anticipated benefits from these collaborations. In addition, any future collaborative arrangements may place the development and commercialization of our product candidates outside our control, may require us to relinquish important rights or may otherwise be on terms unfavorable to us.. We have in the past established and intend to continue to establish collaborations with third parties to develop and commercialize some of our current and future product candidates, and these collaborations may not be successful or we may otherwise not realize the anticipated benefits from these collaborations. For example, in March 2011, we and Ipsen Biopharm Limited, or Ipsen, mutually agreed to terminate our collaboration for the development and commercialization of our toremifene-based product candidate. As of the date of this report, we have no ongoing collaborations for the development and commercialization of our product candidates. We may not be able to locate third-party collaborators to develop and market our product candidates, and we lack the capital and resources necessary to develop our product candidates alone.. Dependence on collaborative arrangements subjects us to a number of risks, including:. <U+0095> we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our potential collaborators may devote to our product candidates;     <U+0095> potential collaborations may experience financial difficulties or changes in business focus;    <U+0095> we may be required to relinquish important rights such as marketing and distribution rights;    <U+0095> should a collaborator fail to develop or commercialize one of our compounds or product candidates, we may not receive any future milestone payments and will not receive any royalties for the compound or product candidate;    <U+0095> business combinations or significant changes in a collaborator's business strategy may also adversely affect a collaborator's willingness or ability to complete its obligations under any arrangement;    <U+0095> under certain circumstances, a collaborator could move forward with a competing product candidate developed either independently or in collaboration with others, including our competitors; and    <U+0095> collaborative arrangements are often terminated or allowed to expire, which could delay the development and may increase the cost of developing our product candidates.. 34. Table of Contents. If third parties do not manufacture our product candidates in sufficient quantities, in the required timeframe, at an acceptable cost, and with appropriate quality control, clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates would be delayed.. We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities, and we rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins, if any, and our ability to develop product candidates and commercialize any product candidates on a timely and competitive basis.. We rely on third-party vendors for the manufacture of SARM and SARD drug substance. If the contract manufacturers that we are currently utilizing to meet our supply needs for enobosarm or any future SARM or SARD product candidates prove incapable or unwilling to continue to meet our supply needs, we could experience a delay in conducting any additional clinical trials of enobosarm or any future SARM or SARD product candidates. We may not be able to maintain or renew our existing or any other third-party manufacturing arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all. If our suppliers fail to meet our requirements for enobosarm or any future product candidates for any reason, we would be required to obtain alternate suppliers. Any inability to obtain alternate suppliers, including an inability to obtain approval from the FDA of an alternate supplier, would delay or prevent the clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates.. Use of third-party manufacturers may increase the risk that we will not have adequate supplies of our product candidates.. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks, to which we would not be subject if we manufactured our product candidates ourselves, including:. <U+0095> reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;    <U+0095> the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control;     <U+0095> the possible termination or non-renewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us; and    <U+0095> drug product supplies not meeting the requisite requirements for clinical trial use.. If we are not able to obtain adequate supplies of our product candidates, it will be more difficult for us to develop our product candidates and compete effectively. Our product candidates and any products that we and/or our potential collaborators may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities.. Our present or future manufacturing partners may not be able to comply with FDA-mandated current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations, other FDA regulatory requirements or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Failure of our third-party manufacturers or us to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our product candidates.. 35. Table of Contents. If third parties on whom we rely do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates.. We do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials for our product candidates, and we must rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, or CROs, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct our clinical trials. In addition, we rely on third parties to assist with our preclinical development of product candidates. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates.. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property. If we lose our licenses from UTRF, we may be unable to continue our business.. We have licensed intellectual property rights and technology from UTRF used in substantially all of our business. Our license agreements with UTRF, under which we were granted rights to SARM compounds and technologies, including enobosarm, and more recently, to SARD compounds and technology, may be terminated by UTRF if we are in breach of our obligations under, or fail to perform any terms of, the relevant agreement and fail to cure that breach. If one or both of these agreements are terminated, then we may lose our rights to utilize the SARM and/or SARD technology and intellectual property covered by those agreements to market, distribute and sell licensed products, which may prevent us from continuing our business and may cause us to cease operations altogether.. If some or all of our or our licensor's patents expire or are invalidated or are found to be unenforceable, or if some or all of our patent applications do not result in issued patents or result in patents with narrow, overbroad, or unenforceable claims, or claims that are not supported in regard to written description or enablement by the specification, or if we are prevented from asserting that the claims of an issued patent cover a product of a third party, we may be subject to competition from third parties with products in the same class of products as our product candidates or products with the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as our product candidates, including in those jurisdictions in which we have no patent protection.. Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection for our product candidates, as well as the methods for treating patients in the product indications using these product candidates. We will be able to protect our product candidates and the methods for treating patients in the product indications using these product candidates from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that we or our exclusive licensor owns or controls such valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets.. Even if our product candidates and the methods for treating patients for prescribed indications using these product candidates are covered by valid and enforceable patents and have claims with sufficient scope, disclosure and support in the specification, the patents will provide protection only for a limited amount of time. Our and our licensor's ability to obtain patents can be highly uncertain and involve complex and in some cases unsettled legal issues and factual questions. Furthermore, different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents, and patents issued in different countries provide different degrees of protection against the use of a patented invention by others. Therefore, if the issuance to us or our licensor, in a given country, of a patent covering an invention is not followed by the issuance, in other countries, of patents covering the same invention, or if any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability, or scope of the claims in, or the written description or. 36. Table of Contents. enablement in, a patent issued in one country is not similar to the interpretation given to the corresponding patent issued in another country, our ability to protect our intellectual property in those countries may be limited. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.. We may be subject to competition from third parties with products in the same class of products as our product candidates or products with the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as our product candidates in those jurisdictions in which we have no patent protection. Even if patents are issued to us or our licensor regarding our product candidates or methods of using them, those patents can be challenged by our competitors who can argue such patents are invalid or unenforceable, lack of utility, lack sufficient written description or enablement, or that the claims of the issued patents should be limited or narrowly construed. Patents also will not protect our product candidates if competitors devise ways of making or using these product candidates without legally infringing our patents. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA regulations and policies create a regulatory environment that encourages companies to challenge branded drug patents or to create non-infringing versions of a patented product in order to facilitate the approval of abbreviated new drug applications for generic substitutes. These same types of incentives encourage competitors to submit new drug applications that rely on literature and clinical data not prepared for or by the drug sponsor, providing another less burdensome pathway to approval.. We also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors, and confidentiality agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.. If we infringe intellectual property rights of third parties, it may increase our costs or prevent us from being able to commercialize our product candidates.. There is a risk that we are infringing the proprietary rights of third parties because numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields that are the focus of our development and manufacturing efforts. Others might have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our or our licensor's pending patent applications and issued patents and/or might have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions. In addition, because patent applications take many months to publish and patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us or our licensor, which may later result in issued patents that cover the production, manufacture, synthesis, commercialization, formulation or use of our product candidates. In addition, the production, manufacture, synthesis, commercialization, formulation or use of our product candidates may infringe existing patents of which we are not aware. Defending ourselves against third-party claims, including litigation in particular, would be costly and time consuming and would divert management's attention from our business, which could lead to delays in our development or commercialization efforts. If third parties are successful in their claims, we might have to pay substantial damages or take other actions that are adverse to our business.. 37. Table of Contents. As a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we might:. <U+0095> be prohibited from selling or licensing any product that we and/or any potential collaborators may develop unless the patent holder licenses the patent to us, which the patent holder is not required to do;    <U+0095> be required to pay substantial royalties or other amounts, or grant a cross license to our patents to another patent holder; or     <U+0095> be required to redesign the formulation of a product candidate so that it does not infringe, which may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time.. Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates. If we or any potential collaborators are not able to obtain required regulatory approvals, we or such collaborators will not be able to commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.. Our product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA, other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries, including the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. Failure to obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate will prevent us or any potential collaborator from commercializing the product candidate. We have not received regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates in any jurisdiction, and we do not expect to obtain FDA, EMA or any other regulatory approvals to market any of our product candidates for the foreseeable future, if at all. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive, often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved.. Changes in the regulatory approval policy during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional regulations or statutes, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Even if the FDA or the EMA approves a product candidate, the approval may impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses, conditions for use, labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and/or production of such product, and may impose ongoing requirements for post-approval studies, including additional research and development and clinical trials. Any FDA approval may also impose risk evaluation mitigation strategies, or REMS, on a product if the FDA believes there is a reason to monitor the safety of the drug in the market place. REMS may include requirements for additional training for health care professionals, safety communication efforts and limits on channels of distribution, among other things. The sponsor would be required to evaluate and monitor the various REMS activities and adjust them if need be. The FDA and EMA also may impose various civil or criminal sanctions for failure to comply with regulatory requirements, including withdrawal of product approval.. Furthermore, the approval procedure and the time required to obtain approval varies among countries and can involve additional testing beyond that required by the FDA. Approval by one regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions.. The FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. For example, in October 2009, we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA regarding our NDA for toremifene 80 mg to. 38. Table of Contents. reduce fractures in men with prostate cancer on ADT notifying us that the FDA would not approve our NDA as a result of certain clinical deficiencies identified in the Complete Response Letter. We have since discontinued our toremifene 80 mg development program, as well as other toremifene-based products. Although we evaluated the potential submission of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the EMA seeking marketing approval of enobosarm 3 mg in the European Union, or EU, for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with advanced NSCLC, based on input from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, we determined that the data from the POWER trials was not sufficient to support the filing and approval of a MAA without confirmatory data from another Phase 3 clinical trial of enobosarm 3 mg. As a result of this input, we elected not to submit a MAA in the absence of such confirmatory data. In addition, since data from the two POWER trials failed to meet the primary statistical criterion pre-specified for the co-primary endpoints of lean body mass and physical function, the FDA would not accept a NDA for enobosarm 3 mg for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with advanced NSCLC.. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the FDA will determine that the data from our ongoing or potential future clinical trials of enobosarm for the treatment of postmenopausal women with SUI will be sufficient for approval of enobosarm in any indications. For example, we may observe an unacceptable incidence of adverse events in our ongoing or potential future clinical trials of enobosarm, which could require us to abandon the development of enobosarm.. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate. Even if we submit an application to the FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities for marketing approval of a product candidate, it may not result in any marketing approvals.. We do not expect to receive regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates for the foreseeable future, if at all. The inability to obtain approval from the FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities for our product candidates would prevent us or any potential collaborators from commercializing these product candidates in the United States, the EU, or other countries. See the section entitled \"Business  -  Government Regulation\" under Part 1, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information regarding risks associated with marketing approval, as well as risks related to potential post-approval requirements.. Risks Related to Commercialization. The commercial success of any products that we and/or any potential collaborators may develop will depend upon the market and the degree of market acceptance among physicians, patients, health care payors and the medical community.. Any products that we and/or any potential collaborators may develop, including enobosarm, may not gain market acceptance for its stated indication among physicians, patients, health care payors and the medical community. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate material product revenues or receive royalties to the extent we currently anticipate, and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:. <U+0095> efficacy and safety results in clinical trials;    <U+0095> the prevalence and severity of any side effects;    <U+0095> potential advantages over alternative treatments;. 39. Table of Contents. <U+0095> whether the products we commercialize remain a preferred course of treatment;    <U+0095> the ability to offer our product candidates for sale at competitive prices;    <U+0095> relative convenience and ease of administration;    <U+0095> the strength of marketing and distribution support; and    <U+0095> sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement.. If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or establish and maintain agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate product revenue from such candidates.. We have limited experience as a company in the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. In the event one of our product candidates is approved, we will need to establish sales and marketing capabilities or establish and maintain agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates. We may be unable to build our own sales and marketing capabilities, and there are risks involved with entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services, which could delay the commercialization of any of our product candidates if approved for commercial sale. In addition, to the extent that we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, our product revenues are likely to be lower than if we market and sell any products that we develop ourselves.. If we and/or any potential collaborators are unable to obtain reimbursement or experience a reduction in reimbursement from third-party payors for products we sell, our revenues and prospects for profitability will suffer.. Sales of products developed by us and/or any potential collaborators are dependent on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payors, both governmental and private. Changes in the reimbursement policies of these third-party payors that reduce reimbursements for any products that we and/or any potential collaborators may develop and sell could negatively impact our future operating and financial results.. Medicare coverage and reimbursement of prescription drugs exists under Medicare Part D for oral drug products capable of self-administration by patients. Our oral drug product candidates would likely be covered by Medicare Part D (if covered by Medicare at all). In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or Healthcare Reform Act. The Healthcare Reform Act, among other initiatives, implemented cost containment and other measures that could adversely affect revenues from sales of product candidates, including an increase in drug rebates manufacturers must pay under Medicaid for brand name prescription drugs and extension of these rebates to Medicaid managed care and a requirement that manufacturers provide a 50% discount on the negotiated price of Medicare Part D brand name drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries during the coverage gap (so-called \"donut hole\").. Some of the provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges, as well as efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Healthcare Reform Act. For example, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Healthcare Reform Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Healthcare Reform Act that would impose a. 40. Table of Contents. fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. In Congress, the U.S. House of Representatives passed Healthcare Reform Act replacement legislation known as the American Health Care Act of 2017 in May 2017, which was not introduced in the Senate. More recently, the Senate Republicans have proposed multiple bills to repeal or repeal and replace portions of the Healthcare Reform Act. Although none of these measures have been enacted, Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or replace certain elements of the Healthcare Reform Act. On October 12, 2017, President Trump signed another Executive Order directing certain federal agencies to propose regulations or guidelines to permit small businesses to form association health plans, expand the availability of short-term, limited duration insurance, and expand the use of health reimbursement arrangements, which may circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Healthcare Reform Act. In addition, citing legal guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, concluded that cost-sharing reduction, or CSR, payments to insurance companies required under the Healthcare Reform Act had not received necessary appropriations from Congress. President Trump subsequently discontinued these payments. The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the Healthcare Reform Act. Tax reform legislation enacted at the end of 2017 eliminated the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 contained various provisions that affect coverage and reimbursement of drugs, including an increase in the discount that manufacturers of Medicare Part D brand name drugs must provide to Medicare Part D beneficiaries during the coverage gap from 50% to 70% starting in 2019. We continue to evaluate the effect that the Healthcare Reform Act and its possible repeal and replacement has on our business. This legislation and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved.. Economic pressure on state budgets may result in states increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for drugs. State Medicaid programs are increasingly requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization for use of drugs where supplemental rebates are not provided. Private health insurers and managed care plans are likely to continue challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many of these third-party payors may limit reimbursement for newly-approved health care products. In particular, third-party payors may limit the indications for which they will reimburse patients who use any products that we and/or any potential collaborators may develop or sell. These cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products that we or any potential collaborators may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us.. Similar cost containment initiatives exist in countries outside of the United States, particularly in the countries of the EU, where the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us or any potential collaborators to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our or a potential collaborators' commercialization efforts. Third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit reimbursement for newly-approved health care products. Recently budgetary pressures in many EU countries are also causing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost containment measures. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we. 41. Table of Contents. might establish for products that we or any potential collaborators may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us.. Another development that could affect the pricing of drugs would be if the Secretary of Health and Human Services allowed drug reimportation into the United States. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 gives discretion to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to allow drug reimportation into the United States under some circumstances from foreign countries, including from countries where the drugs are sold at a lower price than in the United States. If the circumstances were met and the Secretary exercised the discretion to allow for the direct reimportation of drugs, it could decrease the price we or any potential collaborators receive for any products that we and/or any potential collaborators may develop, negatively affecting our revenues and prospects for profitability.. Health care reform measures could hinder or prevent our product candidates' commercial success.. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in health care reform, as evidenced by the initial enactment of, as well as the efforts to repeal and replace the Healthcare Reform Act in the United States. Aside from the possible repeal and replacement of the Healthcare Reform Act, federal and state legislatures within the United States and foreign governments will likely continue to consider changes to existing health care legislation. These changes adopted by governments may adversely impact our business by lowering the price of health care products in the United States and elsewhere. For example, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several U.S. Congressional inquiries and legislative and administrative initiatives at the federal and state levels intended to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing and modify government program reimbursement for drugs. We cannot predict what health care reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing, which could decrease the price we might establish for products that we or any potential collaborators may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us.. We operate in a highly regulated industry and new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to health care availability, method of delivery or payment for health care products and services, or sales, marketing and pricing practices could negatively impact our business, operations and financial condition.. If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.. We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to our prior commercial sales of FARESTON® and the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials, and we will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any product that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:. <U+0095> decreased demand for any product candidates or products;    <U+0095> injury to our reputation;    <U+0095> withdrawal of clinical trial participants;    <U+0095> costs to defend the related litigation;. 42. Table of Contents. <U+0095> substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;    <U+0095> loss of revenue; and    <U+0095> the inability to commercialize any products for which we obtain or hold marketing approvals.. We have product liability insurance that covers our clinical trials and any commercial products up to a $25 million annual aggregate limit. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, and we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.. If our competitors are better able to develop and market products than any products that we and/or any potential collaborators may develop, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated.. We face competition from commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, as well as from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than any products that we and/or any potential collaborators may develop. Competition could result in reduced sales and pricing pressure on our product candidates, if approved, which in turn would reduce our ability to generate meaningful revenue and have a negative impact on our results of operations. In addition, significant delays in the development of our product candidates could allow our competitors to bring products to market before us and impair any ability to commercialize our product candidates.. Various products are currently marketed or used off-label for some of the diseases and conditions that we are targeting in our pipeline, and a number of companies are or may be developing new treatments. These product uses, as well as promotional efforts by competitors and/or clinical trial results of competitive products, could significantly diminish any ability to market and sell any products that we and/or any potential collaborators may develop.. With respect to our SARM program, there are other SARM product candidates in development that may compete with enobosarm and any future SARM product candidates, if approved for commercial sale. We are currently focused on the development of enobosarm for the treatment of postmenopausal women with SUI. There are a variety of treatments that may be used for SUI in women; however, currently, there are no available oral treatment options approved for the treatment of SUI in the United States. Behavioral modification and pelvic floor physical therapy are common initial treatment approaches. Bulking agents, including carbon coated beads (Durasphere® marketed by Coloplast Corp), calcium hydroxlapatite (Coaptite® marketed by BioForm Medical, Inc.) and silicon (Macroplastique® marketed by Cogentix Medical), can be injected into or around the urethra for treating intrinsic sphincter deficiency, a cause of SUI symptoms. Biologic bulking agents including patient-derived adipose stem cells and autologous muscle-derived stem cells (Cook Myosite) are being developed. Recently, an over-the-counter vaginal pessary (Impressa® marketed by Kimberly-Clark) has been approved for the temporary management of urine leakage in women with SUI. Finally, surgical procedures (e.g. sling; bladder neck suspension) have been demonstrated to be effective in some women.. We have also explored the potential of SARMs to treat DMD. DMD is a rare genetic disorder which currently has no cure and leads to a progressive weakening of all the muscles in the body. A number of drugs are in various stages of development by pharmaceutical companies to meet the unmet medical need in DMD. These drugs may compete for patient enrollment during the clinical trial phase, should we be able to advance the development of SARMs as a potential treatment of DMD, or. 43. Table of Contents. commercially if approved. The most advanced development is by those companies who are targeting the genetic mutation with exon skipping or codon blocking therapies including eteplirsen by Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. (FDA approved) and DS-1541b, by Daiichi Sankyo Co which is in a Phase 2 clinical trial. Deflazacort, a glucocorticoid by PTC Therapeutics, is FDA approved. Santhera Pharmaceuticals has initiated an expanded access program in the United States with its synthetic analog of coenzyme Q10, idebenone. Eli Lilly and Company completed a Phase 3 trial with tadalafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, although the study did not meet its primary endpoint. Pfizer Inc. is developing its anti-myostatin monoclonal antibody, PF-06252616, and is currently in a Phase 2 trial. Bristol Myers Squibb Company is developing BMS 986089, an anti-myostatin adnectin, and currently has a Phase 2/3 trial ongoing. Italfarmco S.p.A. has a Phase 3 trial ongoing with givinostat, an HDAC inhibitor. Summit Therapeutics PLC has an ongoing Phase 2 trial with ezutromid, an utrophin upregulator. Cardero Therapeutics Inc. is planning a Phase 2 trial with epicatechin, a flavanol. In addition, Akashi Therapeutics is developing two compounds for DMD, one of which is a SARM. Tarix Orphan is developing TXA127, an angiotensin 1-7 peptide. Fibrogen is developing FG-3019, a monoclonal antibody which inhibits connective tissue growth factor. Catabasis Pharmaceuticals Inc. is developing CAT-1004, an NF-KB inhibitor. ReveraGen Biopharma Inc. has initiated a Phase 2 trial in DMD with VPB 15, a novel glucocorticoid. Capricor Therapeutics has an ongoing Phase 1/2 trial with CAP 1002, cardiosphere derived cells. Solid GT and Sarepta Therapeutics initiated Phase 1/2 trials with adenovirus based microdystrophin products in late 2017.. We have entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with UTRF to develop its proprietary SARD technology which we believe has the potential to provide compounds that can degrade multiple forms of the AR by inhibiting tumor growth in patients with CRPC, including those patients who do not respond or are resistant to current therapies. Drugs in commercial development having potentially similar approaches to removing the AR by degradation include Arvinas Inc.'s ARV-110, which is a chimera with an AR binding moiety on one end and an E3 ligase recruiting element on the other that is in preclinical development for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer, and Androscience Corporation's androgen receptor degrader enhancer, or ARD, which is currently in development for acne and alopecia with the potential for development as a treatment for prostate cancer. Additionally, Essa Pharma Inc. recently completed a Phase 1 study with EPI-506, an AR antagonist that targets the N-terminal domain of the AR, and has plans to develop a second generation agent. C4 Therapeutics, Inc. is developing degronimids as means to degrade the AR through the ligand binding domain associated degradation. CellCentric is developing therapies that target the histone methyltransferase enzyme to lower AR levels and Oric Pharmaceuticals is targeting the glucocorticoid receptor as a means to impact men that have CRPC. In addition to this specific potential mechanistic competition, there are various products approved or under clinical development in the broader space of treating men with advanced prostate cancer who have metastatic CRPC which may compete with our proposed initial clinical objective for our SARD compounds. Pfizer and Astellas Pharma market XTANDI® (enzalutamide), an oral androgen receptor antagonist, for the treatment of metastatic CRPC in men previously treated with docetaxel as well as those that have not yet received chemotherapy. Zytiga®, sold by Johnson & Johnson, has been approved for the treatment of metastatic CRPC. Similarly, Johnson & Johnson acquired Aragon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which developed a second generation anti-androgen apalutamide (ARN-509) which has recently had an NDA submitted to the FDA for the treatment of men with non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Bayer HealthCare and Orion Corporation are currently performing a Phase 3 study of darolutamide (ODM-201) in men with CRPC without metastases and with a rising PSA examining safety and efficacy by measuring metastatic free survival. Another target in prostate cancer that is being pursued by several companies is bromodomain inhibition. Zenith Epigenetics, Gilead Sciences Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline are evaluating BET inhibitors in Phase 1-2 trials.. 44. Table of Contents. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business.. Risks Related to Employees, Growth and Other Aspects of Our Operations. Our internal computer and information technology systems, or those of our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, or could otherwise face serious disruptions, which could result in a material disruption of our product development efforts.. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such events could cause interruptions of our operations. For instance, the loss of preclinical data or data from our ongoing and potential future clinical trials involving our product candidates could result in delays in our development and regulatory filing efforts and significantly increase our costs. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential, proprietary or protected health information, we could be subject to significant legal and financial exposure and suffer reputation harm, and the development of our product candidates could be delayed. In addition, security breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices to access confidential information increases the risk of security breaches. While we have implemented security measures to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent service interruptions or security breaches that could adversely affect our business. In addition, our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems, including corporate firewalls, servers, leased lines and connection to the Internet, face the risk of systemic failure that could disrupt our operations. A significant disruption in the availability of our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems could cause delays in our research and development work and could otherwise adversely affect our business.. If we fail to attract and keep senior management and key scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates.. Our success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, clinical and scientific personnel and on our ability to develop and maintain important relationships with leading academic institutions, clinicians and scientists. If we are not able to attract and keep senior management and key scientific personnel, we may not be able to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates. All of our employees are at-will employees and can terminate their employment at any time.. In October 2013, we announced a reduction of approximately 60% of our workforce following our announcement that our POWER trials failed to achieve the results required by the FDA to file a NDA for enobosarm 3 mg for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with advanced NSCLC. In addition, since our October 2013 workforce reduction, our former Chief Executive Officer, former Chief Financial Officer and former Chief Scientific Officer have resigned. Primarily as a result of our October 2013 workforce reduction, only 27 employees remained as employees of GTx as of. 45. Table of Contents. December 31, 2017. Accordingly, we have been and are operating with a shortage of resources and may not be able to effectively conduct our operations with this limited number of employees. In addition, we announced past workforce reductions in each of December 2009 and June 2011, and our history of implementing workforce reductions, along with the potential for future workforce reductions, may negatively affect our ability to retain or attract talented employees. Further, to the extent we experience additional management transition, competition for top management is high and it may take many months to find a candidate that meets our requirements. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified management personnel, our business could suffer.. We will need to hire additional employees in order to grow our business. Any inability to manage future growth could harm our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates, increase our costs and adversely impact our ability to compete effectively.. As of December 31, 2017, we had only 27 employees, and we will need to hire experienced personnel to develop and commercialize our product candidates and to otherwise grow our business, and we will need to expand the number of our managerial, operational, financial and other employees to support that growth. Competition exists for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field.. Future growth, if any, will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate additional employees. Our future financial performance and our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively.. Management transition creates uncertainties and could harm our business.. We have in the past, and may again in the future, experience significant changes in executive leadership. Changes to company strategy, which can often times occur with the appointment of new executives, can create uncertainty, may negatively impact our ability to execute quickly and effectively, and may ultimately be unsuccessful. In addition, executive leadership transition periods are often difficult as the new executives gain detailed knowledge of our operations, and friction can result from changes in strategy and management style. Management transition inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge, which can negatively affect strategy and execution. Until we integrate new personnel, and unless they are able to succeed in their positions, we may be unable to successfully manage and grow our business, and our results of operations and financial condition could suffer as a result. In any event, changes in our organization as a result of executive management transition may have a disruptive impact on our ability to implement our strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Risks Related to Our Common Stock. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. This volatility may cause our stock price and the value of your investment to decline.. The market prices for securities of biotechnology companies, including ours, have been highly volatile and may continue to be so in the future. In this regard, the closing sale price for our common stock has varied between a high of $13.10 on December 18, 2017 and a low of $2.92 on June 7, 2017 in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations. The following factors, in. 46. Table of Contents. addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:. <U+0095> new or continued delays in the initiation, enrollment and/or completion of our ongoing and any future clinical trials of enobosarm, or negative, inconclusive or mixed results reported in any of our ongoing and any future clinical trials of enobosarm;    <U+0095> our ability to raise additional capital to carry through with our preclinical and clinical development plans, as well as our current and future operations, and the terms of any related financing arrangements;    <U+0095> reports of unacceptable incidences of adverse events observed in any of our ongoing clinical trials of enobosarm;     <U+0095> announcements regarding further cost-cutting initiatives or restructurings;    <U+0095> uncertainties created by our past and potential future management turnover;    <U+0095> our ability to enter into new collaborative, licensing or other strategic arrangements with respect to our product candidates;     <U+0095> the terms and timing of any future collaborative, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;     <U+0095> the timing of achievement of, or failure to achieve, our and any potential collaborators' clinical, regulatory and other milestones, such as the commencement of clinical development, the completion of a clinical trial or the receipt of regulatory approval;    <U+0095> announcement of FDA approval or non-approval of our product candidates or delays in or adverse events during the FDA review process;     <U+0095> actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our product candidates or our clinical trials, including regulatory actions requiring or leading to a delay or stoppage of our ongoing clinical trials;    <U+0095> the commercial success of any product approved by the FDA or its foreign counterparts;    <U+0095> introductions or announcements of technological innovations or new products by us, our potential collaborators, or our competitors, and the timing of these introductions or announcements;    <U+0095> market conditions for equity investments in general, or the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries in particular;     <U+0095> regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;    <U+0095> changes in the structure or reimbursement policies of health care payment systems;    <U+0095> any intellectual property infringement lawsuit involving us;    <U+0095> actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;. 47. Table of Contents. <U+0095> changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;    <U+0095> hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop regarding our common stock;    <U+0095> sales of our common stock and other securities by us, including pursuant to our sales agreement with Stifel;     <U+0095> sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;    <U+0095> the low trading volume of our common stock;    <U+0095> changes in accounting principles; and    <U+0095> additional losses of any of our key scientific or management personnel.. In addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks in particular, have experienced significant volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. For example, negative publicity regarding drug pricing and price increases by pharmaceutical companies has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks. Likewise, as a result of significant changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade and health care spending and delivery, including the possible repeal and/or replacement of all or portions of the Healthcare Reform Act or greater restrictions on free trade stemming from Trump Administration policies, the financial markets could experience significant volatility that could also negatively impact the markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.. In the past, class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market price. Any such litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs, which would hurt our financial condition and results of operations and divert management's attention and resources, which could result in delays of our clinical trials or commercialization efforts.. Our executive officers, directors and largest stockholders have the ability to control all matters submitted to stockholders for approval.. As of December 31, 2017, our executive officers, directors and holders of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock, including their affiliated or associated entities, held approximately 66.2% of our outstanding common stock, and our executive officers and directors alone, including their affiliated or associated entities, held approximately 33.2% of our outstanding common stock as well as warrants to purchase up to an additional 3.2 million shares of common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, have the ability to control all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders.. 48. Table of Contents. If we fail to meet continued listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, our common stock may be delisted. Delisting could adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease, and our ability to obtain sufficient additional capital to fund our operations would be substantially impaired.. Our common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, or Nasdaq, has minimum requirements that a company must meet in order to remain listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. These requirements include maintaining a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share, or the Bid Price Requirement, and the closing bid price of our common stock has in the past been well below $1.00 per share. In this regard, on December 5, 2016, we effected the Reverse Stock Split, the primary purpose of which was to enable us to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement, which compliance was regained on December 20, 2016. However, there can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will remain in excess of the $1.00 minimum bid price for a sustained period of time. In any event, there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the Bid Price Requirement, or any other Nasdaq continued listing requirement, in the future. If we fail to meet these requirements, including the Bid Price Requirement and requirements to maintain minimum levels of stockholders' equity or market values of our common stock, Nasdaq may notify us that we have failed to meet the minimum listing requirements and initiate the delisting process. If our common stock is delisted, the liquidity of our common stock would be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decrease, and our ability to obtain sufficient additional capital to fund our operations would be substantially impaired.. Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.. Our ability to use our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to offset potential future taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is dependent upon our generation of future taxable income before the expiration dates of the net operating loss carryforwards, and we cannot predict with certainty when, or whether, we will generate sufficient taxable income to use all of our net operating loss carryforwards. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law new tax legislation, or the Tax Reform Act. Under the Tax Reform Act, federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Reform Act. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change,\" generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change taxable income or taxes may be limited. We completed a study through December 31, 2016 to determine whether any Section 382 limitations exist and, as a result of this study and our analysis of subsequent ownership changes, we do not believe that any Section 382 limitations exist through December 31, 2017. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code is an extremely complex provision with respect to which there are many uncertainties and we have not established whether the IRS agrees with our determination. In any event, our 2016 and 2017 equity offerings, future equity offerings, including pursuant to the sales agreement with Stifel, and/or changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could in the future result in an ownership change and an accompanying Section 382 limitation. If a limitation were to apply, utilization of a portion of our domestic net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could be limited in future periods and a portion of the carryforwards could expire before being available to reduce future income tax liabilities.. 49.

Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors. Because our Board of Directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. These provisions include:. <U+0095> a classified Board of Directors;    <U+0095> a prohibition on actions by our stockholders by written consent;    <U+0095> the ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \"poison pill\" that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors; and     <U+0095> limitations on the removal of directors.. Moreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Finally, these provisions establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings. These provisions would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.. If there are substantial sales of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could drop substantially, even if our business is doing well.. For the 12-month period ended December 31, 2017, the average daily trading volume of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market was only 77,271 shares. As a result, future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the then-prevailing market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we had 21,541,909 shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, as a result of the low trading volume of our common stock, which was exacerbated by the Reverse Stock Split, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the market price of our common stock in either direction. Moreover, in February 2018, we entered into the sales agreement with Stifel under which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million through Stifel. Sales of our common stock under the sales agreement may be made in sales deemed to be an \"at the market offering,\" including by means of ordinary brokers' transactions. The price for our shares could, for example, decline significantly in the event that a large number of our common shares are sold on the market, including pursuant to the sales agreement with Stifel, without commensurate demand, as compared to an issuer with a higher trading volume that could better absorb those sales without an adverse impact on its stock price.. 50. Table of Contents. In September 2017, we completed a private placement of 5.5 million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 3.3 million shares of our common stock. In November 2014, we completed a private placement of 6.4 million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 6.4 million shares of our common stock (as adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split). Similarly, in March 2014 we completed a private placement of 1.2 million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 1.0 million shares of our common stock (as adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split). Pursuant to the terms of the registration rights or securities purchase agreements we entered into in connection with these private placements, we have filed registration statements under the Securities Act registering the resale of an aggregate of approximately 23.8 million shares of common stock that we issued to, or are issuable upon the exercise of warrants that we issued to, the investors in these private placements, which investors include our largest stockholders. Moreover, J.R. Hyde, III and certain of his affiliates, have rights under a separate registration rights agreement with us to require us to file resale registration statements covering an additional 785,000 shares of common stock held in the aggregate or to include these shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. If Mr. Hyde or his affiliates or any of our other significant stockholders, including the other investors in our private placements, were to sell large blocks of shares in a short period of time, the market price of our common stock could drop substantially.. The recently passed comprehensive tax reform bill could adversely affect our business and financial condition.. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Reform Act into law, which significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Tax Reform Act, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits (including reducing the business tax credit for certain clinical testing expenses incurred in the testing of certain drugs for rare diseases or conditions). Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the new Tax Reform Act is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Reform Act. The impact of the Tax Reform Act on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse. We urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to this legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our common stock."
