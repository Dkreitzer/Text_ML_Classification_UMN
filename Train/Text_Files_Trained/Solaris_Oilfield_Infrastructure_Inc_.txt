[1] "Item 1A.        Risk Factors. The following are certain risk factors that affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Many of these risks are beyond our control. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we face. If any of the events described below were to actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected and our results could differ materially from expected and historical results, any of which may also adversely affect the holders of our stock.. Risks Related to Our Business. Our business depends on domestic capital spending by the oil and natural gas industry, and reductions in capital spending could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.. Our business is directly affected by capital spending to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in the United States. The significant decline in oil and natural gas prices that began in late 2014 caused a reduction in the exploration, development and production activities of most of our customers. In response, we reduced the prices we charged for our systems. Although a moderate recovery began in late 2016 and has continued through 2017 and early 2018, if  oil and natural gas prices decline below current levels for an extended period of time, certain of our customers may be unable to pay their vendors and service providers, including us, as a result of the decline in commodity prices. Reduced discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves in our areas of operation as a result of decreased capital spending may also have a negative long-term impact on our business, even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices. Any of these conditions or events could adversely affect our operating results. If the recent recovery does not continue or our customers fail to further increase their capital spending, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.. Industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpected economic returns to E&P companies of new well completions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdomestic and foreign economic conditions and supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of prices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of domestic and global oil and natural gas inventories;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe supply of and demand for hydraulic fracturing and equipment in the United States;. 19. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfederal, state and local regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities, as well as exploration and production activities, including public pressure on governmental bodies and regulatory agencies to regulate our industry;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tU.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. governmental laws, regulations and taxes, including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttechnical difficulties or failures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the price and availability of transportation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshortages or late deliveries of qualified personnel, equipment or supplies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical and economic conditions in oil and natural gas producing countries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactions by the members of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries with respect to oil production levels and announcements of potential changes in such levels, including the failure of such countries to comply with production cuts announced in November 2016;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tglobal weather conditions and natural disasters;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tworldwide political, military and economic conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of producing and delivering oil and natural gas;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlead times associated with acquiring equipment and products and availability of qualified personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstockholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to limit certain sources of funding for the energy sector or restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of water resources, suitable proppant and chemical additives in sufficient quantities for use in hydraulic fracturing fluids;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadvances in exploration, development and production technologies or in technologies affecting energy consumption;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe potential acceleration of development of alternative fuels;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsignificant changes in the rail industry or the rail lines services our business, such as increased regulation, embargoes and disruption in service; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tuncertainty in capital and commodities markets and the ability of oil and natural gas companies to raise equity capital and debt financing.. The volatility of oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect the demand for our systems and services and negatively impact our results of operations.. The demand for our systems and services is primarily determined by current and anticipated oil and natural gas prices and the related levels of capital spending and drilling activity in the areas in which we have operations. Volatility or weakness in oil prices or natural gas prices (or the perception that oil prices or natural gas prices will decrease) affects the spending patterns of our customers and may result in the drilling of fewer new wells. As a result, demand for proppants may decrease, which could, in turn, lead to lower demand for our systems and services and may cause lower prices and lower utilization of our assets. We have, and may in the future,. 20. Table of Contents. experience significant fluctuations in operating results as a result of the reactions of our customers to changes in oil and natural gas prices. For example, prolonged low commodity prices experienced by the oil and natural gas industry beginning in late 2014 and uncertainty about future prices even when prices increased, combined with adverse changes in the capital and credit markets, caused many E&P companies to significantly reduce their capital budgets and drilling activity. This resulted in a significant decline in demand for oilfield services and adversely impacted the prices oilfield services companies could charge for their services.. Prices for oil and natural gas historically have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile. During the past four years, the posted West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") price for oil has ranged from a low of $26.21 per barrel (\"Bbl\") in February 2016 to a high of $107.26 per Bbl in June 2014. During 2016 and 2017, WTI prices ranged from $26.21 to $60.46 per Bbl. If the prices of oil and natural gas continue to be volatile, reverse their recent increases or decline, our operations, financial condition, cash flows and level of expenditures may be materially and adversely affected.. We face significant competition that may impede our ability to gain market share or cause us to lose market share.. The market for proppant management and logistic services is becoming increasingly competitive. We face competition from proppant producers, pressure pumping companies, transloaders and proppant transporters who also offer solutions for unloading, storing and delivering proppant at well sites and also from competitors who, like us, are focused on developing more efficient last mile logistics management solutions. Some of these solutions utilize containers for on-site proppant storage, handling delivery and others use silo-based storage as we do. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do and may develop technology superior to ours or more cost-effective than ours. Competition in our industry is thus based on price, consistency and quality of products, distribution capability, customer service, reliability of supply, breadth of product offering and technical support. If our competitors are able to respond to industry conditions or trends more rapidly or effectively or resort to price competition, we may be unable to gain or maintain our market share or may lose market share or operating profit, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Technological advancements in well service technologies, including those that reduce the amount of proppant required for hydraulic fracturing operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As competitors and others use or develop new technologies or technologies comparable to ours in the future, we may lose market share or be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Further, we may face competitive pressure to implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we do, which may allow them to gain technological advantages or implement new technologies more rapidly than us. Additionally, we may be unable to implement new technologies or services at all, on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. New technology or changes in our customers' well completion designs could also reduce the demand for proppant or the amount of proppant required for hydraulic fracturing activities, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for our systems and services. Limits on our ability to effectively use, implement or adapt to new technologies may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We may be adversely affected by uncertainty in the global financial markets and the deterioration of the financial condition of our customers.. Our future results may be impacted by the uncertainty caused by an economic downturn, volatility or deterioration in the debt and equity capital markets, inflation, deflation or other adverse economic conditions that may negatively affect us or parties with whom we do business resulting in a reduction in our customers' spending and their non-payment or inability to perform obligations owed to us, such as the failure of customers to honor their commitments or the failure of major suppliers to complete orders. Additionally, during times when the natural gas or crude oil markets weaken, our customers are more likely to experience financial difficulties, including being unable to access debt or equity financing, which could result in a reduction in our customers' spending for our systems and services. In addition, in the course of our business we hold accounts receivable from our customers. In the event of the financial distress or bankruptcy of a customer, we could lose all or a portion of such outstanding accounts receivable associated with that customer. Further, if a customer was to enter into bankruptcy, it could also result in the cancellation of all or a portion of our service contracts with such customer at significant expense or loss of expected revenues to us.. 21. Table of Contents. Reliance upon a few large customers may adversely affect our revenue and operating results.. Our top three customers collectively represented approximately 51% and 58% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. It is likely that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers in the future. If a major customer fails to pay us, revenue would be impacted and our operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed. Additionally, we typically do not enter into long-term contractual agreements with our customers and if we were to lose any material customer, we may not be able to redeploy our equipment at similar utilization or pricing levels or within a short period of time and such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business until the equipment is redeployed at similar utilization or pricing levels.. We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers could adversely affect our financial results.. We are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, many of whose operations are concentrated solely in the domestic E&P industry which, as described above, is subject to volatility and, therefore, credit risk. Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully reduce customer credit risk. For example, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had approximately $0 and $0.1 million of bad debts, respectively, on which we do not expect to collect due to the bankruptcy of a customer. If we are unable to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers or unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness, any resulting increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by them and our inability to re-market or otherwise use our equipment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.. The Kingfisher Facility currently only has one contracted customer on which we rely for all of the facility's revenues. We may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, or at all, which could adversely affect our financial results.. The Kingfisher Facility currently only has one customer contract, which became effective in January 2018. We will initially rely on this one customer for all of the facility's revenues, and our ability to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or increase contracted volumes on favorable terms, or at all, is subject to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Any failure to obtain additional customers at the Kingfisher Facility or the loss of all or a portion of the revenues attributable to our existing customer as a result of competition, creditworthiness, inability to negotiate extensions or replacement of contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations. Significant delay or inability to complete construction of the Kingfisher Facility could result in delay of payments from our one contracted customer until such time construction is completed, if at all.. Delays, changes or increases in plans or costs with respect to the development of the Kingfisher Facility could delay or prevent anticipated project completion and may result in reduced earnings.. Construction and expansion of the Kingfisher Facility is subject to various regulatory, environmental, political, legal, economic and other development risks, including the ability to obtain necessary approvals on a timely basis or at all. Any delay in project construction, including difficulties in engaging qualified contractors necessary to the construction, shortages of equipment, material or skilled labor, increases in the prices of materials, natural disasters and catastrophes, such as hurricanes, explosions, fires, floods, industrial accidents and terrorism, unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and work stoppages and labor disputes may prevent a planned project from going into service when anticipated, which could cause a delay in the receipt of revenues from the Kingfisher Facility. A significant construction delay, whatever the cause, may result in reduced earnings and an inability to complete construction of the Kingfisher Facility as initially planned, or at all. These events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. Increases in regional sand or local sand, or additional transload facilities near our Kingfisher Facility, could affect the volumes and resulting profitability we experience at our Kingfisher Facility. The profitability of our Kingfisher Facility relies in large part upon the volumes of sand being processed through the facility.  Any increase in local or regional sand could eliminate our current and potential customers' need for the Kingfisher Facility, thus reducing the throughput volumes and corresponding profitability.. 22. Table of Contents. Additionally, while we believe our Kingfisher Facility is strategically located in the SCOOP/STACK formation, any additional transload facilities constructed in close proximity to our Kingfisher Facility could result in increased competition for customers and prices and therefore reduce our operating results associated with the facility.. If we are unable to fully protect our intellectual property rights, we may suffer a loss in our competitive advantage or market share.. Our commercial success depends on our patented and proprietary information and technologies, know-how and other intellectual property. Because of the technical nature of our business, we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property. In particular, as of December 31, 2017, we had one patent issued with respect to our mobile proppant management system design and one patent issued with respect to the lifting and lowering mechanism utilized by our systems to erect and lower their silos. We customarily enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate partners and control access to and distribution of our design information, documentation and other patented and proprietary information. In addition, in the future we may acquire additional patents or patent portfolios, which could require significant cash expenditures. However, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patent or other proprietary rights, third parties may challenge patents or proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved. Failure to protect, monitor and control the use of our existing intellectual property rights could cause us to lose our competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. It is possible that our competitors or others could independently develop the same or similar technologies or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technologies. In such case, our trade secrets would not prevent third parties from competing with us. Consequently, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, third parties or our employees may infringe or misappropriate our patented or proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights, which could also harm our business and results of operations. Policing unauthorized use of intellectual property rights can be difficult and expensive, and adequate remedies may not be available.. We may be adversely affected by disputes regarding intellectual property rights of third parties.. Third parties from time to time may initiate litigation against us by asserting that the conduct of our business infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates intellectual property rights. We may not prevail in any such legal proceedings related to such claims, and our systems may be found to infringe, impair, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others. If we are sued for infringement and lose, we could be required to pay substantial damages and/or be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology. Any legal proceeding concerning intellectual property could be protracted and costly regardless of the merits of any claim and is inherently unpredictable and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, regardless of its outcome.. If we were to discover that our technologies or products infringe valid intellectual property rights of third parties, we may need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially re-engineer our products in order to avoid infringement. We may not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms, or at all, or be able to re-engineer our products successfully. If our inability to obtain required licenses for our technologies or products prevents us from selling our products, that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.. Additionally, we currently license certain third party intellectual property in connection with our business, and the loss of any such license could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.. Our operations are subject to inherent risks, some of which are beyond our control. These risks may be self-insured, or may not be fully covered under our insurance policies.. Our assets may be affected by natural or man-made disasters and other external events that may disrupt our manufacturing operations. These hazards can also cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, and suspension or cancellation of operations. In addition, our operations are subject to, and exposed to, employee/employer liabilities and risks such as wrongful termination, discrimination, labor organizing, retaliation claims and general human resource related matters.. The occurrence of a significant event or adverse claim in excess of the insurance coverage that we maintain or that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. Claims for loss of oil. 23. Table of Contents. and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in our industry. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence at a location where our systems are deployed or services are provided may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims.. We do not have insurance against all foreseeable risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs. The occurrence of an event not fully insured against or the failure of an insurer to meet its insurance obligations could result in substantial losses. In addition, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. Insurance may not be available to cover any or all of the risks to which we are subject, or, even if available, it may be inadequate, or insurance premiums or other costs could rise significantly in the future so as to make such insurance prohibitively expensive.. Our assets require capital for maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment and may require significant capital expenditures for new equipment.. Our systems and facilities require capital investment in maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment to maintain their competitiveness. The costs of components and labor have increased in the past and may increase in the future with increases in demand, which will require us to incur additional costs to upgrade our facilities or any systems we may manufacture in the future. Any maintenance, upgrade or refurbishment project for our assets could increase our indebtedness or reduce cash available for other opportunities. Furthermore, such projects may require proportionally greater capital investments as a percentage of total asset value, which may make such projects difficult to finance on acceptable terms. To the extent we are unable to fund such projects, we may have less equipment available for service or our equipment may not be attractive to potential or current customers. Additionally, competition or advances in technology within our industry may require us to update or replace existing facilities or systems or build or acquire new ones. Such demands on our capital or reductions in demand for our systems and services and the increase in cost of labor necessary for such maintenance and improvement, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, prospects and results of operations and may increase our costs.. We rely on a limited number of third party manufacturers to supplement our internal production capacity during periods of peak demand, and delays in deliveries of any outsourced components or increases in the cost of such outsourced components could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.. We have established relationships with a limited number of manufacturers that fabricate certain components of our systems during periods of peak demand to supplement our internal production capacity. Should any of these third-party manufacturers be unable to provide or otherwise fail to deliver such components in a timely manner and in the quantities required, any resulting delays in the provision of such components could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, increasing costs of manufacturing such outsourced components may negatively impact demand for our systems or the profitability of our business operations.. We currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain equipment and materials to build our systems, and our reliance on a limited number of suppliers for such equipment and materials exposes us to risks including price and timing of delivery.. We currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for equipment and materials to build our systems. If demand for our systems or the components necessary to build such systems increases or our suppliers for our equipment face financial distress or bankruptcy, our suppliers may not be able to provide such equipment on schedule at the current price or at all. In particular, steel is the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our systems, and the price of steel has historically fluctuated on a cyclical basis and has often depended on a variety of factors over which we have no control. Additionally, we depend on a limited number of suppliers for the motors that we use in our systems, which are a critical component. If our suppliers are unable to provide the raw materials and components needed to build our systems on schedule at the current price or at all, we could be required to seek other suppliers for the raw materials and components needed to build and operate our systems, which may adversely affect our revenues or increase our costs. Any inability to find alternative components at prices or with quality specifications similar to those deployed today could result in delays or a loss of customers.. 24. Table of Contents. Our business depends on our customers having access to an adequate supply of proppant to meet their needs.. There have been historical shortages of proppant during various periods, including between 2011 and 2014. Because our business depends upon the availability of proppant to our customers, any future proppant shortages could decrease the demand for our systems and services and have a material adverse effect on our operations, prospects and financial condition.. Fluctuations in transportation costs or the availability or reliability of transportation to supply our proppant management systems and transloading services could impair the ability of our customers to take delivery of proppant and thereby adversely impact our business.. Disruption of proppant transportation services due to shortages of rail cars, pneumatic trucks, weather-related problems, flooding, drought, accidents, mechanical difficulties, strikes, lockouts, bottlenecks or other events could temporarily impair the ability of our customers to take delivery of proppant at the well site or our ability to provide transloading services. Accordingly, if there are disruptions of the services utilized by our customers (whether these services are provided by us or a third party), including but not limited to disruptions in the rail industry or a shortage of qualified motor carriers, and they are unable to find alternative transportation providers to transport proppants to the well site, our business could be adversely affected.. Additionally, any disruptions in transportation services associated with delivery of our proppant management systems could result in reduced revenue days associated with such systems or the loss of customers.. A number of our customers operate in urban areas, which could increase the costs of deploying our systems and/or decrease the demand for our systems.. A number of our current and potential customers operate in urban areas, which could disproportionately expose them to operational and regulatory risk in that area. For example, operations within the city limits of various municipalities in northeastern Colorado may involve additional expenses, including expenses relating to mitigation of noise, odor and light that may be emitted in the deployment of our systems, expenses related to the appearance of our systems and limitations regarding when and how our customers can operate our systems. In addition, we and our customers may experience a higher rate of litigation or increased insurance and other costs related to the deployment of our systems in such highly populated areas.. We may have difficulty managing growth of our business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. As a recently formed company, growth of our business could place a significant strain on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. As we expand the scope of our activities and our geographic coverage through organic growth, there will be additional demands on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial control systems or the occurrences of unexpected expansion difficulties, including the failure to recruit and retain experienced managers, engineers and other professionals in the oilfield services industry, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to successfully or timely execute our business plan.. Federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities may serve to limit future oil and natural gas exploration and production activities and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.. We do not conduct hydraulic fracturing but as our primary line of business, we do rent our systems and unload, store and deliver the proppants used in such systems, as well as provide transloading and other logistics services for our customers, who rely on hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions or similar agencies.. However, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority or pursued investigations over certain aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, in February 2014, the EPA asserted regulatory authority pursuant to SDWA UIC program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities. The EPA also published final rules under the CAA in 2012 and in June 2016 governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air. 25. Table of Contents. emissions released during oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing.  The BLM published a final rule in March 2015 that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands, which rule was struck down by a federal judge in June 2016. That decision was subsequently appealed to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in July 2016, the appellate court issued a ruling in September 2017 to vacate the Wyoming trial court decision and dismiss the lawsuit challenging the 2015 rule in response to the BLM's issuance of a proposed rulemaking to rescind the 2015 rule and, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule rescinding the March 2015 rule. In January 2018, litigation challenging the BLM's rescission of the 2015 rule was brought in federal court.  Also, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that \"water cycle\" activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under some circumstances.. From time to time, legislation has been introduced in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process but, to date, such legislation has not been adopted. Also, some states and local governments have adopted, and other governmental entities have, from time to time, considered adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well-construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations, including states where we or our customers operate.. Moreover, our customers typically dispose of flowback and produced water or certain other oilfield fluids gathered from oil and natural gas producing operations in underground disposal wells. This disposal process has been linked to increased induced seismicity events in certain areas of the country, particularly in Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico and Arkansas. These and other states have begun to consider or adopt laws and regulations that may restrict or otherwise prohibit oilfield fluid disposal in certain areas or underground disposal wells, and state agencies implementing these requirements may issue orders directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations or impose standards related to disposal well construction and monitoring. Any one or more of these developments may result in our customers having to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates or locations, or require our customers or third party disposal well operators that are used by our customers to cease disposal well activities, which developments could adversely affect our customers' business and result in a corresponding decrease in the need for our systems and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process and associated processes could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and natural gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays for our customers or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult for our customers to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells and an associated decrease in demand for our systems and services and increased compliance costs and time, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.. Finally, water is an essential component of shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Our customers' access to water to be used in these processes may be adversely affected due to reasons such as periods of extended drought, private, third party competition for water in localized areas or the implementation of local or state governmental programs to monitor or restrict the beneficial use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to assure adequate local water supplies. Our customers' inability to locate or contractually acquire and sustain the receipt of sufficient amounts of water could adversely impact their exploration and production operations and have a corresponding adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Changes in transportation regulations may increase our costs and negatively impact our results of operations.. We are subject to various transportation regulations including as a motor carrier by the U.S. Department of Transportation and by various federal, state and tribal agencies, whose regulations include certain permit requirements of highway and safety authorities. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers over our trucking operations, generally governing such matters as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety, equipment testing, driver requirements and specifications and insurance requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may impact our operations, such as changes in fuel emissions limits, hours of service regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period and limits on vehicle weight and size. As the federal government continues to develop and propose regulations relating to fuel quality,. 26. Table of Contents. engine efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions, we may experience an increase in costs related to truck purchases and maintenance, impairment of equipment productivity, a decrease in the residual value of vehicles, unpredictable fluctuations in fuel prices and an increase in operating expenses. Increased truck traffic may contribute to deteriorating road conditions in some areas where our operations are performed. Our operations, including routing and weight restrictions, could be affected by road construction, road repairs, detours and state and local regulations and ordinances restricting access to certain roads. Proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, are also made from time to time, and any such increase would increase our operating costs. Also, state and local regulation of permitted routes and times on specific roadways could adversely affect our operations. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any legislative or regulatory changes or municipal ordinances applicable to our logistics operations will be enacted and to what extent any such legislation or regulations could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations.. We are subject to environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.. Our operations and the operations of our customers are subject to numerous federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety, protection of natural resources and the environment, and waste management, including the transportation and disposal of wastes and other materials. Numerous governmental entities, including the EPA and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly actions. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations on our operations and the operations of our customers, including the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, the imposition of restrictions on the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected in formations in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production activities, the incurrence of capital expenditures to mitigate or prevent releases of materials from our equipment, facilities or from customer locations where we are deploying our systems and providing our services, the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations, and the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection. Any failure on our part or the part of our customers to comply with these laws and regulations could result in prohibitions or restrictions on operations, assessment of sanctions including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, issuance of corrective action orders requiring the performance of investigatory, remedial or curative activities or enjoining performance of some or all of our operations in a particular area. In particular, under certain circumstances, environmental agencies may delay or refuse to grant required approvals or cancel or amend existing permits or leases that may relate to our customers' operations, in which event such operations may be interrupted or suspended for varying lengths of time, causing a reduced demand for our systems and services, an associated loss of revenue to us and adversely affecting our results of operations in support of those customers.. Our business activities present risks of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities, including costs and liabilities resulting from our handling of regulated materials, such as oilfield and other wastes, because of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations, and due to historical oilfield industry operations and waste disposal practices. In addition, private parties, including the owners of properties upon which we deploy our systems or provide our services and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages. Some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, which means that in some situations we could be exposed to liability as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Remedial costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and costs associated with changes in environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.. Laws and regulations protecting the environment generally have become more stringent in recent years and are expected to continue to do so, which could lead to material increases in costs for future environmental compliance and remediation. Changes in existing laws or regulations, or the adoption of new laws or regulations, could delay or curtail exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and natural gas and could have a corresponding adverse effect on us by reducing the demand for our systems and services. We may not be able to recover some or any of our costs of compliance with these laws and regulations from insurance.. 27. Table of Contents. Silica-related legislation, health issues and litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.. We are subject to laws and regulations relating to human exposure to crystalline silica. In March 2016, OSHA amended its legal requirements, publishing a final rule that established a more stringent permissible exposure limit for exposure to respirable crystalline silica and provided other provisions to protect employees, such as requirements for exposure assessment, methods for controlling exposure, respiratory protection, medical surveillance, hazard communication, and recordkeeping. This final rule became effective in June 2016 and compliance deadlines with respect to hydraulic fracturing will apply on June 23, 2018. Federal and state regulatory authorities, including OSHA, may continue to propose changes in their regulations regarding workplace exposure to crystalline silica, such as permissible exposure limits and required controls and personal protective equipment and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations relating to exposure to crystalline silica that are adopted, or that the costs of complying with such future laws and regulations would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results by requiring us to modify or cease our operations.. In addition, the inhalation of respirable crystalline silica is associated with the lung disease silicosis. There is recent evidence of an association between crystalline silica exposure or silicosis and lung cancer and a possible association with other diseases, including immune system disorders such as scleroderma. These health risks have been, and may continue to be, a significant issue confronting the hydraulic fracturing industry. Concerns over silicosis and other potential adverse health effects, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of hydraulic fracture sand, may have the effect of discouraging our customers' use of hydraulic fracture sand. The actual or perceived health risks of handling hydraulic fracture sand could materially and adversely affect hydraulic fracturing service providers, including us, through reduced use of hydraulic fracture sand, the threat of product liability or employee lawsuits, increased scrutiny by federal, state and local regulatory authorities of us and our customers or reduced financing sources available to the hydraulic fracturing industry.. Anti-indemnity provisions enacted by many states may restrict or prohibit a party's indemnification of us.. We typically enter into agreements with our customers governing the use and operation of our systems and services, which usually include certain indemnification provisions for losses resulting from operations. Such agreements may require each party to indemnify the other against certain claims regardless of the negligence or other fault of the indemnified party; however, many states place limitations on contractual indemnity agreements, particularly agreements that indemnify a party against the consequences of its own negligence. Furthermore, certain states, including Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming have enacted statutes generally referred to as \"oilfield anti-indemnity acts\" expressly prohibiting certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to oilfield services agreements. Such anti-indemnity acts may restrict or void a party's indemnification of us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.. Fuel conservation measures could reduce demand for oil and natural gas which would in turn reduce the demand for our systems and services.. Fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements and increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, the increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources (such as wind, solar geothermal, tidal, and biofuels) could reduce demand for hydrocarbons and therefore for our systems and services, which would lead to a reduction in our revenues.. Unsatisfactory safety performance may negatively affect our customer relationships and, to the extent we fail to retain existing customers or attract new customers, adversely impact our revenues.. Our ability to retain existing customers and attract new business is dependent on many factors, including our ability to demonstrate that we can reliably and safely operate our business in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws, rules and permits, which legal requirements are subject to change. Existing and potential customers consider the safety record of their third-party service providers to be of high importance in their decision to engage such providers. If one or more accidents were to occur in connection with the use of our systems or performance of our services, the affected customer may seek to terminate or cancel its use of our services and may be less likely to continue to use our systems, which could cause us to lose substantial revenues. Furthermore, our ability to attract new customers may be impaired if they elect not to engage us because they view our safety record as unacceptable. In. 28. Table of Contents. addition, it is possible that we will experience multiple or particularly severe accidents in the future, causing our safety record to deteriorate. This may be more likely as we continue to grow, if we experience high employee turnover or labor shortage, or hire inexperienced personnel to bolster our staffing needs.. Climate change legislation and regulations restricting or regulating emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating and capital costs for our customers and reduced demand for our systems and services.. Climate change continues to attract considerable public, governmental and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of greenhouse gases (\"GHGs\"). While no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level, the EPA and states or groupings of states have pursued legal initiatives in recent years that seek to reduce GHG emissions through efforts that include consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. In particular, the EPA has adopted rules under authority of the CAA that, among other things, establish certain PSD construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, which reviews could require securing PSD permits at covered facilities emitting GHGs and meeting \"best available control technology\" standards for those GHG emissions. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the United States, including, among others, onshore production.. Federal agencies also have begun directly regulating emissions of methane, a GHG, from oil and natural gas operations. In June 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing NSPS Subpart OOOOa, that requires certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce these methane gas and VOC emissions. These Subpart OOOOa standards will expand the previously issued NSPS Subpart OOOO requirements issued in 2012 by using certain equipment-specific emissions control practices, requiring additional controls for pneumatic controllers and pumps as well as compressors, and imposing leak detection and repair requirements for natural gas compressor and booster stations.  However, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay certain portions of the June 2016 standards for two years and re-evaluate the entirety of the 2016 standards but the EPA has not yet published a final rule and, as a result, the June 2016 rule remains in effect but future implementation of the 2016 standards is uncertain at this time.  In another example, the BLM published a final rule in November 2016 that imposes requirements to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaking on federal and Indian lands.  However, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule that temporarily suspends or delays certain requirements contained in the November 2016 final rule until January 17, 2019.  The suspension of the November 2016 final rule is being challenged in court.  These rules, should they remain in effect, and any other new methane emission standards imposed on the oil and gas sector could result in increased costs to our or our customers' operations as well as result in delays or curtailment in such operations, which costs, delays or curtailment could adversely affect our business. Additionally, in December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France that prepared an agreement requiring member countries to review and \"represent a progression\" in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. This \"Paris agreement\" was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force in November 2016; however, this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions. However, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States' adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may re-enter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.. The adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state legislation or regulations that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise restrict emissions of GHGs could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, demand for our systems and services, results of operations, and cash flows.. Recently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production or midstream activities. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will continue to rise and will not peak until after 2040 and that oil and natural gas will. 29. Table of Contents. continue to represent a substantial percentage of global energy use over that time. Finally, increasing concentrations of GHG in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If any such climate changes were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and the financial condition and operations of our customers.. Any future indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.. Although we currently have no indebtedness outstanding under our 2018 Credit Agreement (as defined in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Debt Agreements\"), our 2018 Credit Agreement has a borrowing capacity of up to $70.0 million.. In addition, subject to the limits contained in our 2018 Credit Agreement, we may incur additional debt from time to time. Any borrowings we may incur in the future would have several important consequences for our future operations, including that:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcovenants contained in the documents governing such indebtedness may require us to meet or maintain certain financial tests, which may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in our industry, such as being able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities when they arise;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate and other purposes may be limited;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be competitively disadvantaged to our competitors that are less leveraged or have greater access to capital resources; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions.. If we incur indebtedness in the future, we may have significant principal payments due at specified future dates under the documents governing such indebtedness. Our ability to meet such principal obligations will be dependent upon future performance, which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay any incurred indebtedness. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we may be required to sell assets, to refinance all or a portion of such indebtedness or to obtain additional financing.. Our 2018 Credit Agreement subjects us to various financial and other restrictive covenants. These restrictions may limit our operational or financial flexibility and could subject us to potential defaults under our 2018 Credit Agreement.. Our 2018 Credit Agreement subjects us to significant financial and other restrictive covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on incurring additional debt and certain distributions. Our ability to comply with these financial condition tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to do so.. Our 2018 Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants, including a certain leverage ratio and a certain minimum fixed charge coverage ratio we must maintain. Please see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Debt Agreements.\". If we are unable to remain in compliance with the financial covenants of our 2018 Credit Agreement, then amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become due immediately. Any such acceleration could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. Increases in interest rates could adversely impact the price of our shares, our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes.. Interest rates on future borrowings, credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. Changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who. 30. Table of Contents. invest in our shares, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on the price of our shares, our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes.. Our business is difficult to evaluate because we have a limited operating history.. We were formed in February 2017 and have limited historical financial and operating results. For purposes of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our accounting predecessor is Solaris LLC, which was formed in July 2014. For periods prior to the IPO, our historical financial information and operational data described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is that of Solaris LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries. As a result, there is only limited historical financial and operating information available upon which to base your evaluation of our performance.. We rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business.. Many key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees. The loss of their services could adversely affect our business. In particular, the loss of the services of one or more members of our executive team, including our chief executive officer or chief financial officer, could disrupt our operations. We do not have any written employment agreement with our executives at this time. Further, we do not maintain \"key person\" life insurance policies on any of our employees. As a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees.. If we are unable to access the services of a sufficient number of skilled and qualified workers, our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired.. The manufacture and delivery of our products and performance of our services requires skilled and qualified workers with specialized skills and experience who can perform physically demanding work. As a result of the volatility of the oilfield services industry and the demanding nature of the work, workers may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive. Our ability to be productive and profitable will depend upon our ability to have access to the services of skilled workers. In addition, our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase the size of our skilled labor force. The demand for skilled workers is high, and the supply is limited. As a result, competition for experienced personnel is intense, and a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force, increases in the rates that we must pay, or both. If either of these events were to occur, our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired.. We may grow through acquisitions and our failure to properly plan and manage those acquisitions may adversely affect our performance.. We have completed and may, in the future, pursue asset acquisitions or acquisitions of businesses. We must plan and manage any acquisitions effectively to achieve revenue growth and maintain profitability in our evolving market. If we fail to manage acquisitions effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected. The process of upgrading acquired assets to our specifications and integrating acquired assets or businesses may also involve unforeseen costs and delays or other operational, technical and financial difficulties and may require a significant amount time and resources and may divert management's attention from existing operations or other priorities. Our failure to incorporate acquired assets or businesses into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Such events could also mean an acquisition that we expected to be accretive is not accretive and, in extreme cases, the asset is idle.. Our industry overall has experienced a high rate of employee turnover. Any difficulty we experience replacing or adding personnel could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.. We are dependent upon the available labor pool of skilled employees and may not be able to find enough skilled labor to meet our needs, which could have a negative effect on our growth. In addition, we are dependent upon a large number of independent contractors to service our business and construct our proppant management systems.  Increased competition for their services could result in a loss of available, skilled contractors or services at a price that is not as advantageous to our business, both of which could negatively affect our operating results. We are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wage, overtime and other working conditions. Our systems and services require skilled workers who can perform physically demanding work. As a result of our industry volatility, including the recent and pronounced decline in drilling activity, as well as the. 31. Table of Contents. demanding nature of the work, many workers in our industry have left to pursue employment in different fields. Though our historical turnover rates have been significantly lower than those of our competitors, if we are unable to retain or meet growing demand for skilled technical personnel, our operating results and our ability to execute our growth strategies may be adversely affected.. We may be subject to claims for personal injury and property damage, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, prospects and results of operations.. Our systems and services are subject to inherent risks that can cause personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment or the suspension of our operations. Litigation arising from operations where our systems are deployed or services are provided, may cause us to be named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting potentially large claims including claims for exemplary damages. We maintain what we believe is customary and reasonable insurance to protect our business against these potential losses, but such insurance may not be adequate to cover our liabilities, and we are not fully insured against all risks.. In addition, our customer assumes responsibility for, including control and removal of, all other pollution or contamination which may occur during operations, including that which may result from seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of drilling and completion fluids. We may have liability in such cases if we are negligent or commit willful acts. Our customers generally agree to indemnify us against claims arising from their employees' personal injury or death to the extent that, in the case of our well site services, their employees are injured or their properties are damaged by such services, unless resulting from our gross negligence or willful misconduct. Our customers also generally agree to indemnify us for loss or destruction of customer-owned property or equipment. In turn, we agree to indemnify our customers for loss or destruction of property or equipment we own and for liabilities arising from personal injury to or death of any of our employees, unless resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct of the customer. However, we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation or might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation. As a result, we may incur substantial losses which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.. Seasonal weather conditions and natural disasters could severely disrupt normal operations and harm our business.. Our operations are located in different regions of the United States, some of which are prone to periods of heavy snow, ice or rain and others of which may be prone to certain natural disasters such as tornadoes. The occurrence of any such severe weather conditions or natural disasters could cause our E&P customers to suspend operations, thereby reducing the demand for our systems and services and our ability to generate revenues. The exploration activities of our customers may also be affected during such periods of adverse weather conditions. Additionally, extended drought conditions in our operating regions could impact our ability or our customers' ability to source sufficient water or increase the cost for such water. As a result, a natural disaster or inclement weather conditions could severely disrupt the normal operation of our business and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.. We may be subject to interruptions or failures in our information technology systems.. We rely on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure to support our business, including but not limited to process control technology through our integrated Railtronix and PropView inventory management systems. Any of these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, usage errors by employees, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other security breaches, or similar events. The failure of any of our information technology systems may cause disruptions in our operations, which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.. We are subject to cyber security risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.. The oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain processing activities. For example, we depend on digital technologies to deliver our systems and perform many of our services and to process and record financial and operating data. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks, have increased. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. Our technologies, systems and networks, and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Our systems for protecting against cyber security risks may not be. 32. Table of Contents. sufficient. As cyber incidents continue to evolve, we will likely be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents.. A terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.. The occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries, including continued hostilities in the Middle East, may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. If any of these events occur, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas, potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our systems and services and causing a reduction in our revenues. Oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers' operations is destroyed or damaged. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.. We engage in transactions with related parties and such transactions present possible conflicts of interest that could have an adverse effect on us.. We have entered into transactions with related parties. The details of certain of these transactions are set forth in note 14. \"Related Party Transactions\" under Part II, Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" Related party transactions create the possibility of conflicts of interest with regard to our management or directors. Such a conflict could cause an individual in our management or on our board of directors to seek to advance his or her economic interests above ours. Further, the appearance of conflicts of interest created by related party transactions could impair the confidence of our investors. Our board of directors regularly reviews these transactions. Notwithstanding this, it is possible that a conflict of interest could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.. Our historical financial statements may not be indicative of future performance.. Due to our limited operating history, comparisons of our current and future operating results with prior periods are difficult. As a result, our limited historical financial performance may make it difficult for stockholders to evaluate our business and results of operations to date and to assess our future prospects and viability.. We may record losses or impairment charges related to idle assets or assets that we sell.. Prolonged periods of low utilization, changes in technology or the sale of assets below their carrying value may cause us to experience losses. These events could result in the recognition of impairment charges that negatively impact our financial results. Significant impairment charges as a result of a decline in market conditions or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods.. Future regulations relating to and interpretations of recently enacted U.S. federal income tax legislation may vary from our current interpretation of such legislation.. The U.S. federal income tax legislation recently enacted in Public Law No. 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"), is highly complex and subject to interpretation. The presentation of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our current interpretation of the provisions contained in the Tax Act. In the future, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service are expected to release regulations relating to and interpretive guidance of the legislation contained in the Tax Act. Any significant variance of our current interpretation of such legislation from any future regulations or interpretive guidance could result in a change to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could negatively affect our business.. The final impact of the Tax Act on us could be materially different from our current estimates and could have an adverse impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate.. The net benefits of the Tax Act, are recorded as provisional amounts as of December 31, 2017, represent the Company's best estimate using information available to the Company as of March 6, 2018. The Company will refine its estimates to incorporate new. 33. Table of Contents. or better information as it becomes available through the filing date of its 2017 U.S. income tax returns in the fourth quarter of 2018. Recognized impacts could be materially different from current estimates based on our actual results in 2018 and our further analysis of the new law. Because we are in the process of fully quantifying the impact of the Tax Act on us, we expect to record any adjustments in 2018 in accordance with the guidance provided in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. These adjustments could be material. The full impact of the Tax Act on our business, operations, and financial statements cannot be predicted at this time and we make no assurances in this regard. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.. Changes to state tax laws in response to recently enacted U.S. federal tax legislation.. Currently, many states conform their calculation of corporate taxable income to the calculation of corporate taxable income at the U.S. federal level. Due to recently enacted changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, certain states may change or modify the calculation of corporate taxable income at the state level. Any resulting increase in costs due to such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.. Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock. Solaris Inc. is a holding company. Solaris Inc.'s sole material asset is its equity interest in Solaris LLC and Solaris Inc. is accordingly dependent upon distributions from Solaris LLC to pay taxes, make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and cover its corporate and other overhead expenses.. Solaris Inc. is a holding company and has no material assets other than its equity interest in Solaris LLC. Solaris Inc. has no independent means of generating revenue. To the extent Solaris LLC has available cash, Solaris Inc. intends to cause Solaris LLC to make (i) generally pro rata distributions to its unitholders, including Solaris Inc., in an amount at least sufficient to allow Solaris Inc. to pay its taxes and to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and any subsequent tax receivable agreements that Solaris Inc. may enter into in connection with future acquisitions and (ii) non-pro rata payments to it to reimburse it for Solaris Inc.'s corporate and other overhead expenses. To the extent that Solaris Inc. needs funds and Solaris LLC or its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions or payments under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of any future financing arrangements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, Solaris Inc.'s liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.. Moreover, because Solaris Inc. has no independent means of generating revenue, its ability to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement is dependent on the ability of Solaris LLC to make distributions to Solaris Inc. in an amount sufficient to cover its obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. This ability, in turn, may depend on the ability of Solaris LLC's subsidiaries to make distributions to it. The ability of Solaris LLC, its subsidiaries and other entities in which it directly or indirectly holds an equity interest to make such distributions is subject to, among other things, (i) the applicable provisions of Delaware law (or other applicable jurisdiction) that may limit the amount of funds available for distribution and (ii) restrictions in relevant debt instruments issued by Solaris LLC or its subsidiaries and/other entities in which it directly or indirectly holds an equity interest. To the extent that Solaris Inc. is unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid.. The requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.. As a public company, we need to comply with new laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, related regulations of the SEC and the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\"), with which we were not required to comply as a private company. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements will occupy a significant amount of time of our board of directors and management and will significantly increase our costs and expenses. We will need to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinstitute a more comprehensive compliance function;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcomply with rules promulgated by the NYSE;. 34. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontinue to prepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablish new internal policies, such as those relating to insider trading; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinvolve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities.. Furthermore, while we generally must comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, we are not required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls until our first annual report subsequent to our ceasing to be an \"emerging growth company\" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act. Accordingly, we may not be required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls until as late as our annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. Once it is required to do so, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed. Compliance with these requirements may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.. In addition, we expect that being a public company subject to these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. We are currently evaluating these rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.. If we fail to develop or maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our Class A common stock.. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We cannot be certain that our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls will be successful, that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or that we will be able to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any failure to develop or maintain effective internal controls, or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving our internal controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock.. The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.. Although our Class A common stock is listed on the NYSE, we do not know whether an active trading market will continue to develop or how liquid that market might be. You may not be able to resell your Class A common stock at or above the public offering price. Additionally, the lack of liquidity may result in wide bid-ask spreads, contribute to significant fluctuations in the market price of the Class A common stock and limit the number of investors who are able to buy the Class A common stock.. Our principal stockholders collectively hold a significant amount of the voting power of our common stock.. Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our stockholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law or our certificate of incorporation, and the Original Investors own a substantial majority of our Class B common stock, representing 44% of our combined economic interest and voting power.. Although the Original Investors are entitled to act separately in their own respective interests with respect to their ownership in us, if the Original Investors choose to act in concert, they will together have the ability to strongly influence the election of the members of our board of directors, and thereby our management and affairs. In addition, they will be able to strongly influence the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including mergers and other material transactions. The existence of significant. 35. Table of Contents. stockholders may also have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of our company.. So long as the Original Investors continue to control a significant amount of our common stock, each will continue to be able to strongly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, regardless of whether or not other stockholders believe that a potential transaction is in their own best interests. In any of these matters, the interests of the Original Investors may differ or conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. In addition, certain of our Original Investors, including Yorktown, and their respective affiliates may, from time to time, acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with our business, as well as businesses that are significant existing or potential customers. Such Original Investors and their respective affiliates may acquire or seek to acquire assets that we seek to acquire and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us or may be more expensive for us to pursue. Moreover, this concentration of stock ownership may also adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with a controlling stockholder.. Certain of our directors have significant duties with, and spend significant time serving, entities that may compete with us in seeking acquisitions and business opportunities and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating time or pursuing business opportunities.. Certain of our directors hold positions of responsibility with other entities (including affiliated entities) that are in the oil and natural gas industry. These directors may become aware of business opportunities that may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as to the other entities with which they are or may become affiliated. Due to these existing and potential future affiliations, they may present potential business opportunities to other entities prior to presenting them to us, which could cause additional conflicts of interest. They may also decide that certain opportunities are more appropriate for other entities with which they are affiliated, and as a result, they may elect not to present those opportunities to us. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor. For additional discussion of our directors' business affiliations and the potential conflicts of interest of which our stockholders should be aware, see note 14. \"Related Party Transactions\" under Part II, Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\". Certain Designated Parties are not limited in their ability to compete with us, and the corporate opportunity provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation could enable such Designated Parties and their respective affiliates to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us.. Our governing documents provide that Yorktown, Wells Fargo Central Pacific Holdings, Inc. and our directors who are not also our officers, including William A. Zartler, the Chairman of our board of directors, and their respective portfolio investments and affiliates (collectively, the \"Designated Parties\") are not restricted from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us.. In particular, subject to the limitations of applicable law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpermits such Designated Parties to conduct business that competes with us and to make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovides that if such Designated Parties, or any employee, partner, member, manager, officer or director of such Designated Parties who is also one of our directors, becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter, they will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us.. The Designated Parties may become aware, from time to time, of certain business opportunities (such as acquisition opportunities) and may direct such opportunities to other businesses in which they have invested, in which case we may not become aware of or otherwise have the ability to pursue such opportunity. Furthermore, such businesses may choose to compete with us for these opportunities, possibly causing these opportunities to not be available to us or causing them to be more expensive for us to pursue. In addition, the Designated Parties may dispose of oil and natural gas service assets in the future, without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase any of those assets. As a result, our renouncing our interest and expectancy in any business opportunity that may be from time to time presented to the Designated Parties could adversely impact our business or prospects if attractive business opportunities are procured by such parties for their own benefit rather than for ours.. 36. Table of Contents. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and could deprive our investors of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares.. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval in one or more series, designate the number of shares constituting any series, and fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdividing our board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving staggered three-year terms;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproviding that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law or, if applicable, the rights of holders of a series of preferred stock, only be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum (prior to such time, vacancies may also be filled by stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares);.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpermitting any action by stockholders to be taken only at an annual meeting or special meeting rather than by a written consent of the stockholders, subject to the rights of any series of preferred stock with respect to such rights;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpermitting special meetings of our stockholders to be called only by our board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of authorized directors whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequiring the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% in voting power of all then outstanding common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, to remove any or all of the directors from office at any time, and directors will be removable only for \"cause\";.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablishing advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproviding that the board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal our bylaws.. In addition, certain change of control events have the effect of accelerating the payment due under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which could be substantial and accordingly serve as a disincentive to a potential acquirer of our company. Please see \" - In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\". Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\"), our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Any person or entity. 37. Table of Contents. purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described in the preceding sentence. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.. We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our Class A common stock appreciates.. We do not plan to declare cash dividends on shares of our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in us will be if you sell your Class A common stock at a price greater than you paid for it. There is no guarantee that the price of our Class A common stock that will prevail in the market will ever exceed the price that you paid.. Future sales of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.. We may sell additional shares of our Class A common stock in subsequent offerings. In addition, subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the Original Investors may redeem their Solaris LLC Units (together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock) for shares of Class A common stock (on a one-for-one basis, subject to conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassification and other similar transactions) and then sell those shares of Class A common stock.. We previously filed a registration statement with the SEC on Form S-8 providing for the registration of 5,629,888 shares of our Class A common stock issued or reserved for issuance under our long term incentive plan. Subject to the satisfaction of vesting conditions, shares registered under the registration statement on Form S-8 may be made available for resale immediately in the public market without restriction.. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Class A common stock or securities convertible into Class A common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our Class A common stock will have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A common stock.. Solaris Inc. will be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for certain tax benefits that it may claim, and the amounts of such payments could be significant.. In connection with the closing of the IPO, Solaris Inc. entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with the TRA Holders. This agreement generally provides for the payment by Solaris Inc. to each TRA Holder of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax and franchise tax that Solaris Inc. actually realizes (computed using simplifying assumptions to address the impact of state and local taxes) or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances in periods after the IPO as a result of certain increases in tax basis and certain benefits attributable to imputed interest. Solaris Inc. will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these cash savings.. The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement will continue until all tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement have been utilized or expired, unless Solaris Inc. exercises its right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement (or the Tax Receivable Agreement is terminated due to other circumstances, including Solaris Inc.'s breach of a material obligation thereunder or certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination or other changes of control), and Solaris Inc. makes the termination payment specified in the Tax Receivable Agreement. In addition, payments Solaris Inc. makes under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be increased by any interest accrued from the due date (without extensions) of the corresponding tax return.. 38. Table of Contents. The payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are Solaris Inc.'s obligations and not obligations of Solaris LLC, and Solaris Inc. expects that the payments it will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial. Estimating the amount and timing of payments that may become due under the Tax Receivable Agreement is by its nature imprecise. For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, cash savings in tax generally are calculated by comparing Solaris Inc.'s actual tax liability (determined by using the actual applicable U.S. federal income tax rate and an assumed combined state and local income and franchise tax rate) to the amount Solaris Inc. would have been required to pay had it not been able to utilize any of the tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. The actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of any redemption of Solaris LLC Units, the price of Solaris Inc.'s Class A common stock at the time of each redemption, the extent to which such redemptions are taxable transactions, the amount and timing of the taxable income Solaris Inc. generates in the future, the U.S. federal income tax rates then applicable, and the portion of Solaris Inc.'s payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that constitute imputed interest or give rise to depreciable or amortizable tax basis.. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not conditioned upon a holder of rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement having a continued ownership interest in Solaris Inc. or Solaris LLC. For additional information regarding the Tax Receivable Agreement, see note 11. \"Income Taxes\" under Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\". In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, Solaris Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.. If we experience a change of control (as defined under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which includes certain mergers, asset sales and other forms of business combinations) or the Tax Receivable Agreement terminates early (at Solaris Inc.'s election or as a result of its breach), we would be required to make a substantial, immediate lump-sum payment. This payment would equal the present value of hypothetical future payments that could be required to be paid under the Tax Receivable Agreement (determined by applying a discount rate of one-year London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") plus 100 basis points). The calculation of hypothetical future payments will be based upon certain assumptions and deemed events set forth in the Tax Receivable Agreement, including that (i) Solaris Inc. has sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the tax benefits covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement (including having sufficient taxable income to currently utilize any accumulated net operating loss carryforwards) and (ii) any Solaris LLC Units (other than those held by Solaris Inc.) outstanding on the termination date are deemed to be redeemed on the termination date. Any early termination payment may be made significantly in advance of, and may materially exceed, the actual realization, if any, of the future tax benefits to which the termination payment relates.. If we experience a change of control (as defined under the Tax Receivable Agreement) or the Tax Receivable Agreement otherwise terminates early, Solaris Inc.'s obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on Solaris Inc.'s liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales or other forms of business combinations or changes of control. For example, if the Tax Receivable Agreement were terminated immediately after the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the estimated termination payments would, in the aggregate, be approximately $122.1 million (calculated using a discount rate equal to one-year LIBOR plus 100 basis points, applied against an undiscounted liability of $153.5 million, based upon the last reported closing sale price of our Class A common stock on  December 31, 2017). The foregoing number is merely an estimate and the actual payment could differ materially. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.. Please read note 11. \"Income Taxes\" under Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\". In the event that Solaris Inc.'s payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are accelerated upon certain mergers, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control, the consideration payable to holders of our Class A common stock could be substantially reduced.. If we experience a change of control (as defined under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which includes certain mergers, asset sales and other forms of business combinations) Solaris Inc. would be obligated to make a substantial, immediate lump-sum payment, and such payment may be significantly in advance of, and may materially exceed, the actual realization, if any, of the future tax benefits to which the payment relates. As a result of this payment obligation, holders of our Class A common stock could receive substantially less consideration in connection with a change of control transaction than they would receive in the absence of such obligation. Further, Solaris Inc.'s payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement will not be conditioned upon the TRA Holders. 39. Table of Contents. having a continued interest in Solaris Inc. or Solaris LLC. Accordingly, the TRA Holders' interests may conflict with those of the holders of our Class A common stock. Please read \"Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock - In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits Solaris Inc. realizes, if any, in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement\" and note 11. \"Income Taxes\"  under Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\". We will not be reimbursed for any payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement in the event that any tax benefits are subsequently disallowed.. Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we will determine. The TRA Holders will not reimburse us for any payments previously made under the Tax Receivable Agreement if any tax benefits that have given rise to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are subsequently disallowed, except that excess payments made to any TRA Holder will be netted against payments that would otherwise be made to such TRA Holder, if any, after our determination of such excess. As a result, in such circumstances, we could make payments that are greater than our actual cash tax savings, if any, and may not be able to recoup those payments, which could adversely affect our liquidity.. We may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our Class A common stock.. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our Class A common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our Class A common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the Class A common stock.. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, including those relating to accounting standards and disclosure about our executive compensation, that apply to other public companies.. We are classified as an \"emerging growth company\" under the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, which may be up to five full fiscal years, unlike other public companies, we will not be required to, among other things: (i) provide an auditor's attestation report on management's assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; (ii) comply with any new requirements if adopted by the PCAOB requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer; (iii) provide certain disclosures regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies; or (iv) hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation. The Company has elected not to use the extended transition period for complying with any new or revised financial accounting standards. We may remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2022, although we will lose that status sooner if we have more than $1.07 billion of revenues in a fiscal year, have more than $700.0 million in market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.. To the extent that we rely on any of the exemptions available to emerging growth companies, you will receive less information about our executive compensation and internal control over financial reporting than issuers that are not emerging growth companies. If some investors find our Class A common stock to be less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.. If securities or industry analysts adversely change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.. The trading market for our Class A common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.. 40. Table of Contents. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our Class A common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline."
