[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes.  Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if any of these risks occurs and, as a result, the market price of our ordinary shares could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may have similar adverse effects on us.. Risks Related to Our Limited Operating History. We have a limited operating history on which to assess our business, have incurred significant losses over the last several years, and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses until achieving sufficient revenues from Keveyis, Macrilen, or one or more of our product candidates, if approved.. Until we acquired the U.S. marketing rights to Keveyis, in December 2016, we were a development-stage biopharmaceutical company. We have a limited operating history and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully complete a large-scale, pivotal clinical trial, obtain regulatory approval, or manufacture and commercialize a product candidate. Other than our limited commercial experience with Keveyis, which we launched in April 2017, we have no meaningful prior commercial operations upon which to evaluate our business and predictions about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products.. Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We have devoted substantially all of our financial resources to identifying, in-licensing, acquiring and developing our product candidates, conducting clinical trials, commercializing Keveyis, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. In January 2018, we acquired an exclusive license to the intellectual property rights relating to Macrilen in order to carry out the development, manufacturing, registration and commercialization of Macrilen, or any pharmaceutical product containing the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Macrilen, macimorelin acetate, in the United States and Canada, and ownership of all product registrations related to Macrilen in these countries.. To achieve commercial success of Keveyis, Macrilen and any product candidates that are approved, we will have to expand our sales, marketing and supply capabilities or outsource these activities to a third party.. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of equity securities, the proceeds from our initial public offering of ordinary shares in the United States in October 2015 and follow-on public offerings in October 2017 and January 2018, our at-the-market facility, and debt financings. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in part, on whether we successfully commercialize Keveyis, Macrilen or one of our other product candidates, if approved, and the rate of our future expenditures as well as our ability to obtain funding through strategic collaborations or grants. To become and remain profitable, we must successfully commercialize Keveyis, Macrilen or one or more of our product candidates, if approved.. We have never been, and may never be, profitable.. We have only two products, Keveyis and Macrilen, approved for commercialization, and two product candidates in development. We did not generate any revenue until we launched Keveyis in April 2017. Our ability to generate significant future revenue from product sales and become profitable depends heavily on our success in many areas, including, but not limited to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIntegrating Keveyis and Macrilen and any other products or product candidates that we in-license or acquire, as well as completing research, formulation and process development, and preclinical or clinical development, as applicable, of those product candidates, including successfully completing clinical trials of those product candidates;. 38. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmaintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that can timely provide adequate, in amount and quality, products to support clinical development of our product candidates and the market demand for Keveyis and Macrilen and any other product candidates that are approved;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtaining market acceptance of Keveyis and Macrilen and our product candidates, if approved, and persuading adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe or utilize our products and other product candidates, if approved;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\taddressing any competing technological and market developments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tidentifying, assessing, in-licensing, acquiring and/or developing new product candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnegotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmaintaining, protecting and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and know-how; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tattracting, hiring and retaining adequate numbers of qualified sales and marketing personnel.. We are currently advancing two product candidates through clinical development, Recorlev (levoketoconazole) and veldoreotide. Development of product candidates is expensive, and we expect our research and development expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue our ongoing trials and initiate new nonclinical studies and clinical trials of Recorlev, veldoreotide and any other product candidates we may seek to develop.. Biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. It may be several years, if ever, before we receive regulatory approval and have a product candidate, other than Keveyis and Macrilen, approved for commercialization. Our future revenue from Keveyis and Macrilen and from any other product candidates approved for commercialization will depend upon the size of the markets in which our product candidates are marketed, or in which they may receive approval, and our ability to achieve market acceptance and adequate market share for our product candidates in those markets.. Given the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses until we successfully commercialize Keveyis, Macrilen or one or more of our product candidates. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontinue to grow our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontinue research and nonclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, including advancing our programs from preclinical development into clinical trials and increasing the number and size of our current clinical trials and preclinical studies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake up-front, milestone or other payments under any asset acquisition, supply, or license arrangements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tseek to identify, assess, in-license, acquire and develop additional product candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchange or add manufacturers or suppliers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tseek regulatory approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;. 39. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tseek to maintain, protect and expand our intellectual property portfolio;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tseek to attract and retain skilled personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcreate additional infrastructure to support our operations as a U.S. listed company and our product development and commercialization efforts; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texperience any delays or encounter issues with any of the above, including, but not limited to, failed preclinical studies or clinical trials, complex results, safety issues or other regulatory challenges that may require either longer follow-up of existing preclinical studies or clinical trials or limitation of additional preclinical studies or clinical trials in order to pursue regulatory approval.. Further, the net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance. Moreover, if we incur substantial losses, we could be liquidated, and the value of our shares might be significantly reduced or the shares might be of no value.. We have incurred, and anticipate we will continue to incur, significant costs associated with commercializing Keveyis. We will incur additional costs related to our development, manufacturing, registration and commercialization of Macrilen, as well as any of our other product candidates that are approved. Further, our revenue will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we have received regulatory approval, the accepted price for the product, the ability to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement, and whether we own the commercial rights for that territory. If the number of our addressable patients is not as significant as we estimate, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than we expect, or the treatment population is narrowed by competition, physician choice or treatment guidelines, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of our product candidates. If we are not able to generate sufficient revenue from the sale of any of our approved products, we may never become profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to successfully execute any of the foregoing would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.. We expect that we will need substantial additional funding before we can expect to complete the development of our two product candidates.. We are currently advancing two product candidates through clinical development, Recorlev (levoketoconazole) and veldoreotide. Development of product candidates is expensive, and we expect our research and development expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue our ongoing trials and initiate new nonclinical studies and clinical trials of Recorlev, veldoreotide and any other product candidates we may seek to develop. Although we believe the combination of our existing cash and cash equivalents and additional borrowings under our credit facility is sufficient to fund planned operations at least through the regulatory approval and commercial launch of Recorlev, if successful, we expect that we will require additional capital to obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, both of our product candidates. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe amount of revenue that we receive from sales of Keveyis and Macrilen;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of expanding our sales, marketing, distribution and administrative capabilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe scope, rate of progress, results and cost of our clinical trials, nonclinical testing, and other related activities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of formulation, process development, manufacturing of clinical supplies, and establishing commercial supplies of our product candidates and any other product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire;. 40. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhether we borrow any additional amounts under our credit facility;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue, including any additional product candidates we may in-license or acquire;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of defending potential intellectual property disputes, including patent infringement actions brought by third parties against us or our product candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory approvals;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish, including any required milestone and royalty payments thereunder; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe emergence of competing technologies and their achieving commercial success before we do or other adverse market developments.. Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may compromise our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates, if approved. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Moreover, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our shareholders and the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline.. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of our research or development programs or the commercialization of any product or product candidates that is approved, or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired.. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our shareholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our intellectual property or future revenue streams.. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of product revenue, equity offerings, debt financings, grants, and license and development agreements in connection with any collaborations. We have borrowed $85 million under our credit facility. An additional $15 million may be borrowed if we satisfy certain product revenue and market capitalization conditions. We do not have any committed external source of funds. In the event we seek additional funds, we may raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities. In such an event, the ownership interests of our current shareholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that would adversely affect their rights as shareholders. Debt financing, if available, could result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, make capital expenditures, acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights or declare dividends, and other operating restrictions that could hurt our ability to conduct our business.. Further, if we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our intellectual property or future revenue streams. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.. 41. Table of Contents. We are expanding our organization and may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.. As our development, commercialization, in-licensing, and acquisition plans and strategies develop, and as we commercialize Keveyis and Macrilen and advance the clinical and preclinical development of our product candidates, we expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial, legal and other resources. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities, and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. Due to our limited financial resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Any such growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the in-licensing, acquisition and development of additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or grow revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.. In order to increase adoption and sales of Keveyis and Macrilen and other product candidates we may commercialize, we will need to continue developing our commercial organization as well as recruit and retain qualified sales representatives.. Part of our strategy is to continue to build a biopharmaceutical company to successfully execute the commercialization of our products. We may not be able to successfully commercialize our products in the United States or in any other territories where we have commercial rights. Prior to our launch of Keveyis in April 2017, we had no experience commercializing products on our own. In order to successfully commercialize our approved products, we must continue to build our sales, marketing, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities. Although we have established a sales force consisting of approximately 21 orphan disease sales representatives focused on Keveyis, our resources are still limited compared to some of our competitors. For example, we will need to hire additional sales representatives to focus on commercialization of Macrilen. The continued development of our commercial organization to market our products and any additional products we may acquire will be expensive and time-consuming. We also cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to successfully develop this capability.. If we are unable to effectively train and equip our sales force, our ability to successfully commercialize our products will be harmed.. The members of our sales force have limited experience promoting Keveyis and no experience promoting Macrilen, which we only recently acquired. We have expended significant time and resources to train our sales force to be effective in their sales efforts for Keveyis and will need to devote significant additional time and resources to hire new individuals and train them with respect to Macrilen. For example, we must train our sales force to ensure that consistent and appropriate messages about Keveyis and Macrilen are being delivered to our potential customers. Our sales representatives may also experience challenges promoting Keveyis or Macrilen when we call on physicians and their office staff. We are likely to experience turnover of the sales representatives that we have hired or will hire, requiring us to train new sales representatives. If we are unable to effectively train our sales force and equip them with effective materials, including medical and sales literature to help them inform and educate physicians about the benefits of our products and their proper administration and label indication, as well as our patient access programs, our efforts to successfully commercialize our products could be put in jeopardy, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, share price and operations.. We may not be successful in executing our research programs or business development efforts.. Research programs and business development efforts to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential programs or product. 42. Table of Contents. candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. Our research programs, business development efforts or licensing attempts may fail to yield additional complementary or successful product candidates for clinical development and commercialization for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour research or business development methodology or search criteria and process may be unsuccessful in identifying potential product candidates with a high probability of success for development progression;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may not be able or willing to assemble sufficient resources or expertise to in - license, acquire or discover additional product candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may not be able to agree to acceptable terms with the licensor or owner of any product candidates we seek to in-license or acquire;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour product candidates may not succeed in preclinical studies or clinical trials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may not succeed in formulation or process development;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour product candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics that may make the products unmarketable or unlikely to receive regulatory approval;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompetitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete or less attractive;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct candidates that we develop may be covered by third parties' patents or other exclusive rights;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct candidates that we develop may not allow us to leverage our expertise and our development and commercial infrastructure as currently expected;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe market for a product candidate may change during our program so that such a product may become unreasonable to continue to develop;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third - party payors.. If any of these events occurs, we may not be successful in executing our growth strategy or our growth strategy may not deliver the anticipated results.. We may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.. We have limited financial and managerial resources. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.. If we acquire other businesses or in-license or acquire other product candidates and are unable to integrate them successfully, our financial performance could suffer.. If we are presented with appropriate opportunities, we may acquire other businesses or product candidates. We have had limited experience integrating other businesses or product candidates, or in-licensing or acquiring other product candidates. The recent acquisitions of the U.S. and Canadian marketing rights of Macrilen in January 2018 and the U.S.. 43. Table of Contents. marketing rights of Keveyis in December 2016 are still being integrated into our business. The integration process following these or any future transactions may produce unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be directed to the ongoing development of our business. Also, in any future in-licensing or acquisition transactions, we may issue shares of stock that would result in dilution to existing shareholders, incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets, any of which might harm our financial results and cause our stock price to decline. Any financing we might need for future transactions may be available to us only on terms that restrict our business or impose costs that reduce our net income.. We are highly dependent on our key personnel, including our chief executive officer and chief medical officer, as well as our ability to recruit, retain and motivate additional qualified personnel.. We are highly dependent on Matthew Pauls, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Dr. Fredric Cohen, our Chief Medical Officer. Some members of our management team, including Mr. Pauls, have only been our employees since August 2014. As a result, they have limited experience working for us and working together as a team. Any member of management or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. Although we have included non-compete provisions in their respective employment or consulting agreements, as the case may be, such arrangements might not be sufficient for the purpose of preventing such key personnel from entering into agreements with any of our competitors. The inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel, or the loss of Mr. Pauls or Dr. Cohen, could result in competitive harm as we could experience delays in reaching our in-licensing, acquisition, development and commercialization objectives.. We also depend substantially on highly qualified managerial, sales and technical personnel who are difficult to hire and retain. There is currently a shortage of skilled personnel in our industry, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for individuals with similar skill sets. In addition, failure to succeed in preclinical studies or clinical trials may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. Recruiting and retaining other qualified employees, consultants and advisors for our business, including scientific and technical personnel, will be critical to our success.. Our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.. Our computer systems, as well as those of our clinical research organizations (\"CROs\"), and other contractors and consultants, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, including hurricanes, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. For example, the loss of preclinical study or clinical trial data from completed, ongoing or planned preclinical studies or clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of personal, confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.. Risks Related to Our Business. We depend entirely on the success of Keveyis, Macrilen and our two product candidates, which are still in clinical development. If we do not successfully commercialize Keveyis or Macrilen or obtain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize one or more of our product candidates or we experience significant delays in doing so, we may never become profitable.. We currently have two products approved for sale, Keveyis and Macrilen, and two product candidates in development. We have invested, and continue to expect to invest, a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our two product candidates, which are still in clinical development. Our ability to generate product revenues will depend heavily on our successful commercialization of Keveyis and Macrilen and our eventual commercialization, if approved, of one or more of our product candidates currently in development. We are not. 44. Table of Contents. permitted to market or promote any product candidate before we receive regulatory approval from the FDA, EMA or any comparable foreign regulatory agency, and we may never receive such regulatory approval for our product candidates currently in development. The success of Recorlev and veldoreotide will depend on several additional factors, including, but not limited to, the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuccessfully completing clinical trials that demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuccessfully completing formulation and process development activities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacceptance of our product candidates by patients and the medical community;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta continued acceptable safety profile following approval;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtaining and maintaining healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompeting effectively with other therapies, including with respect to the sales and marketing of our product candidates, if approved.. Many of these factors are beyond our control, including clinical development, the regulatory submission process, potential threats to our intellectual property rights and changes in the competitive landscape. If we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully complete clinical trials or eventually commercialize our product candidates, if approved.. Clinical trials are very expensive, time consuming and difficult to design and implement, and involve uncertain outcomes. Furthermore, results of earlier preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be predictive of results of future preclinical studies or clinical trials.. To obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to market and sell any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate through extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials that our products are safe and effective in humans. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and earlier clinical trials may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. For example, the results generated to date in preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates do not ensure that later preclinical studies or clinical trials will demonstrate similar results. Further, we have limited clinical data for each of our product candidates and have not completed Phase 3 clinical trials for any of our product candidates. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials.. Companies in the biopharmaceutical industry may suffer setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier clinical trials. For example, levoketoconazole was previously studied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In December 2005, prior to the initiation of the first clinical trial by DiObex, our licensee, the FDA placed a clinical hold relating to a safety concern for use of a dosage above 600 mg/day. DiObex modified the clinical trial protocol to limit the highest dose to 600 mg/day, and the clinical hold was lifted by the FDA in February 2006. Furthermore, levoketoconazole did not demonstrate a reduction in blood glucose levels in a small Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the original indication for which it was being developed. We may experience delays in our ongoing or future preclinical studies or clinical trials, and we do not know whether future preclinical studies or clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of subjects or patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials may be delayed, suspended or terminated for a variety of reasons, including delay or failure to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtain authorization from regulators or IRBs to commence a clinical trial at a prospective clinical trial site;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treach agreements on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and clinical trial sites;. 45. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trecruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients in clinical trials to ensure adequate statistical power to detect statistically significant treatment effects;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\taddress any noncompliance with regulatory requirements or safety concerns that arise during the course of a clinical trial;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thave patients complete clinical trials or return for post - treatment follow - up;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thave CROs or other third parties comply with regulatory requirements, adhere to the trial protocol or meet contractual obligations in a timely manner or at all;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tidentify a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and initiate them within the planned timelines; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmanufacture sufficient quantities of the product candidate to complete clinical trials.. Positive or timely results from preclinical or early stage clinical trials do not ensure positive or timely results in late stage clinical trials or regulatory approval by the FDA, EMA or any comparable foreign regulatory agency. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. Preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. Many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain regulatory approval for the product candidates. The FDA, EMA and any comparable foreign regulatory agency have substantial discretion in the approval process and in determining when or whether regulatory approval will be obtained for any of our product candidates. Even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA, EMA or any comparable foreign regulatory agency.. In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in clinical trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, adherence to the administration regimen and other clinical trial protocols, and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. In the case of our late stage clinical product candidates, results may differ in general on the basis of the larger number of clinical trial sites and additional countries involved in Phase 3 clinical trials. Different countries have different standards of care and different levels of access to care for patients, which in part drives the heterogeneity of the patient populations that enroll in our studies.. In June 2015, we acquired veldoreotide and were not involved in and had no control over the preclinical and clinical development of this product candidate prior to such acquisition. As a result, we are dependent on the prior research and development of veldoreotide having been conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, the accuracy of reported results of all clinical trials conducted prior to our acquisition and the correct interpretation of collected data from these clinical trials. These factors could result in increased costs and delays in the development of veldoreotide, which could hurt our ability to generate future revenues from this product candidate.. The regulatory approval process of the FDA, EMA or any comparable foreign regulatory agency may be lengthy, time consuming and unpredictable.. Our future success is dependent upon our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and then successfully commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Although certain of our employees have prior experience with submitting marketing applications to the FDA, EMA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies, we, as a company, have not submitted such applications for our product candidates. We cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Applications for any of our product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA, EMA or any comparable foreign regulatory agency may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials or our interpretation of data from nonclinical trials or clinical trials;. 46. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe population studied in the clinical program may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assure safety in the full population for which we seek approval, including reliance on foreign clinical data;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support a finding that has statistical significance or clinical meaningfulness or support the submission of a NDA or other submission, or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be unable to demonstrate to the FDA, EMA or any comparable foreign regulatory agency that a product candidate's risk - benefit ratio for its proposed indication is acceptable;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA, EMA or any comparable foreign regulatory agency may fail to approve the manufacturing processes, test procedures and specifications or facilities of third - party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA, EMA or any comparable foreign regulatory agency may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.. Any of our current or future product candidates could take a significantly longer time to gain regulatory approval than expected or may never gain regulatory approval. This could delay or eliminate any potential product revenue by delaying or terminating the potential commercialization of our product candidates.. Several elements of the SONICS Phase 3 clinical trial design for Recorlev were informed by the clinical development pathway of currently approved drug therapies in the United States and the European Union. Additionally, we incorporated advice from the CHMP and FDA into the design of the clinical trial. In communication we had with the FDA, they recommended use of a concurrent control group in SONICS. However, SONICS utilizes an open-label, single-arm design because use of a placebo control in a parallel-arm monotherapy design was considered unethical or infeasible to enroll, depending on the specific country or clinical trial site under consideration. Studies lacking an active control group are more likely to be subject to unanticipated variability in study results that can potentially lead to flawed conclusions because they do not allow for discrimination of patient outcomes. As a result, even if we achieve the clinical trial's endpoints, the FDA or other regulatory authorities could view our study results as potentially biased.. We intend to seek formal advice and guidance from the FDA and the EMA prior to advancing veldoreotide into further studies and pivotal clinical trials. If the feedback we receive is different from what we currently anticipate, this could delay the development and regulatory approval process for this product candidate.. We generally plan to seek regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates in the United States, the European Union and other key global markets. To obtain regulatory approval in other countries, we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of such other countries regarding safety, efficacy, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, clinical trials, commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our product candidates. Even if we are successful in obtaining approval in one jurisdiction, we cannot ensure that we will obtain approval in any other jurisdictions. Failure to obtain marketing authorization for our product candidates will result in our being unable to market and sell such products. If we fail to obtain approval in any jurisdiction, the geographic market for our product candidates could be limited. Similarly, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates.. If we or others identify previously unknown, serious side effects of Keveyis or Macrilen, we may be required to perform lengthy additional clinical trials, change their labeling or withdraw them from the market.. If we or others identify previously unknown, serious side effects of Keveyis or Macrilen:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory authorities may withdraw their approvals;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be required to conduct additional clinical trials, make changes in labeling, implement changes to or obtain re-approvals of facilities that manufacture Keveyis or Macrilen;. 47. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may experience a significant drop in the sales of Keveyis or Macrilen;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour reputation in the marketplace may suffer; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may become the target of lawsuits, including class action lawsuits.. Any of these events could harm or prevent sales of Keveyis and Macrilen or could increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing Keveyis and Macrilen.. Physicians may accept Keveyis and/or Macrilen slowly or may never accept them, which would adversely affect our financial results.. Physicians will prescribe Keveyis only if they determine, based on experience, clinical data, side effect profiles and other factors, that it is preferable to other treatments, even if those products are not approved for PPP. Because PPP is rare, most physicians are inexperienced in the care of patients with the illness and it may be difficult to persuade them to prescribe Keveyis. Other factors that may affect the commercial success of Keveyis include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe preference of some physicians for more familiar, long-standing, off-label treatments for PPP, such as acetazolamide;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompetition from alternative therapies, such as potassium supplements, diuretics, beta receptor agonists, mexiletine and other sodium channel blockers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost-effectiveness of Keveyis and the availability of third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe product labeling required by the FDA.. Physicians will prescribe Macrilen only if they determine, based on experience, clinical data, side effect profiles and other factors, that it is preferable to other diagnostic methods, even if those methods are not approved for diagnosing AGHD. Because AGHD is rare, most physicians are inexperienced in the diagnosis of patients with the illness and it may be difficult to persuade them to prescribe Macrilen..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe preference of some physicians to utilize Arginine, an injectable product that is the only other FDA-approved product indicated for use in diagnosing AGHD, or one of several other products that are used off-label to diagnose AGHD, of which the two most frequently prescribed products are the injectables glucagon and insulin;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost-effectiveness of Macrilen and the availability of third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe product labeling required by the FDA.. The failure of Keveyis and Macrilen to achieve commercial success could prevent us from generating sufficient revenue to fully fund our commercial and development activities.. If serious adverse, undesirable or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of our product candidates or following regulatory approval, if any, we may need to abandon our development of such product candidates.. If our product candidates are associated with serious adverse, undesirable or unacceptable side effects, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or sub-populations in which such side effects are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many compounds that initially showed promise in preclinical or early stage testing have later been found to cause side effects that restricted their use and prevented further development of the compound for larger indications.. 48. Table of Contents. For example, in our clinical trials of Recorlev to date, adverse events have included headache, nausea, back pain, dizziness, diarrhea and liver enzyme elevations. For veldoreotide, which is given by subcutaneous injections, adverse events have included injection site reaction such as swelling, itching and pain. In addition, headache and gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and diarrhea were observed for veldoreotide. These adverse events can be dose-dependent and may increase in frequency and severity if we increase the dose to increase efficacy. Occurrence of serious treatment-related side effects could impede clinical trial enrollment, require us to halt the clinical trial, and prevent receipt of regulatory approval from the FDA, EMA or any comparable foreign regulatory agency. They could also adversely affect physician or patient acceptance of our product candidates.. Discovery of previously unknown problems, or increased focus on a known problem, with an approved product may result in restrictions on its permissible uses, including withdrawal of the medicine from the market. Currently, ketoconazole is required to include a \"black box\" warning on its label for use as an antifungal related to liver toxicity in the United States. Manufactured ketoconazole consists of two enantiomers, 2R,4S-ketoconazole and 2S,4R-ketoconazole, that are found in equal amounts, and is therefore referred to as a racemate mixture. Recorlev is a single-enantiomer drug, a pure form of one of the two enantiomers (2S,4R-ketoconazole) of ketoconazole. If Recorlev is required to include a similar \"black box\" warning on its label, it may limit our ability to commercialize the product, if approved.. Additionally, if one or more of our product candidates receives regulatory approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such product(s), a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including, but not limited to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twithdrawal by regulatory authorities of approvals of such product;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tseizure of the product by regulatory authorities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trecall of the product;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions on the marketing of the product;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequirement by regulatory authorities of additional warnings on the label, such as a black box warning;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequirement that we create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcommitment to expensive additional safety studies prior to launch as a prerequisite of approval by regulatory authorities of such product;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcommitment to expensive post - marketing studies as a prerequisite of approval by regulatory authorities of such product;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinitiation of legal action against us claiming to hold us liable for harm caused to patients; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tharm to our reputation and resulting harm to physician or patient acceptance of our products.. Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. We may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials given the limited number of patients who have the diseases for the treatment of which our product candidates are being studied. Difficulty in enrolling patients in our clinical trials could delay or prevent clinical trials of our product candidates.. Successful and timely completion of clinical trials will require that we enroll a sufficient number of patient candidates. Clinical trials may be subject to delays as a result of patient enrollment taking longer than anticipated or patient withdrawal. Patient enrollment depends on many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, eligibility criteria for the clinical trial, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the design of the clinical protocol, the availability of competing clinical trials, the availability of new drugs approved for the indication the clinical trial is. 49. Table of Contents. investigating, and clinicians' and patients' perceptions as to the safety and potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies.. Because we are focused on addressing rare diseases, there are limited patient pools from which to draw in order to complete our clinical trials in a timely and cost-effective manner. Delays in the completion of any clinical trial of our product candidates will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process, and delay or potentially jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue. In addition, many of the factors that may lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.. We may become exposed to costly and damaging liability claims, either in connection with the sale of Keveyis, Macrilen or other approved products or when testing our product candidates in the clinic, and our product liability insurance may not cover all damages from such claims.. We are exposed to potential product liability and professional indemnity risks that are inherent in the research, development, manufacturing, marketing, and use of pharmaceutical products. The current and future use of product candidates by us in clinical trials, and the sale of Keveyis and Macrilen and any approved products, may expose us to liability claims. These claims might be made by patients that use the product, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, or others selling such products. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could be difficult and costly to defend, and could compromise the market acceptance of Keveyis and Macrilen, our product candidates or any prospects for commercialization of our product candidates, if approved.. Although the clinical trial process is designed to identify and assess potential side effects, it is always possible that a drug, even after regulatory approval, may exhibit unforeseen side effects. If Keveyis, Macrilen or any of our product candidates were to cause adverse side effects during clinical trials or after approval, we may be exposed to substantial liabilities. Physicians and patients may not comply with product instructions or may ignore warnings regarding potential adverse effects and patients who should not use our products.. We have limited product liability insurance that offers coverage we believe to be appropriate for a company marketing a single pharmaceutical product and developing others. We intend to extend our product liability insurance coverage to any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. However, this insurance may be prohibitively expensive or may not fully cover our potential liabilities. Our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of Keveyis, Macrilen or other product candidates that are approved, or result in meaningful underinsured or uninsured liability. Defending a lawsuit could be costly and significantly divert management's attention from conducting our business. If we were sued successfully, our liability could exceed our total assets.. We may not be able to build an effective sales and marketing team.. We currently have a very limited sales force and marketing and distribution capabilities. To achieve commercial success of Keveyis, Macrilen and any product candidates that are approved, we will have to continue to develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities or outsource these activities to a third party.. Factors that may affect our ability to successfully commercialize Keveyis, Macrilen and our product candidates on our own include recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel, obtaining access to or persuading adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our product candidates and other unforeseen costs associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization. Developing a sales and marketing organization requires significant investment and is time consuming. We may not be able to build an effective sales and marketing organization in the United States, the European Union or other key global markets. If we are unable to establish effective sales and marketing capabilities or to find suitable partners for the commercialization of Keveyis, Macrilen and our product candidates, we may not generate revenues from them.. 50. Table of Contents. We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry, which may result in our competitors discovering, developing or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do, or our entering a market in which a competitor has commercialized an established competing product, and we may not be successful in competing with them.. The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change. Our success is highly dependent upon our ability to in-license, acquire, develop and obtain regulatory approval for new and innovative drug products on a cost-effective basis and to market them successfully. In doing so, we face and will continue to face intense competition from a variety of businesses, including large, fully integrated, well-established pharmaceutical companies who already possess a large share of the market, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biopharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other private and public research institutions in Europe, the United States and other jurisdictions.. Keveyis is an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, that was approved in the United States to treat hyperkalemic, hypokalemic and related variants of PPP. Acetazolamide, another oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is used frequently off-label for the prophylactic and sometimes acute treatment of PPP. Potassium supplements, are indicated for use in hypokalemic periodic paralysis in the United States and are frequently used either chronically or for emergency treatment of episodes in that form of PPP. Several other types of drugs have been reported to have benefits for chronic or acute use in one or more than one PPP variant, including potassium-sparing diuretics, beta receptor agonists, mexelitine and other sodium channel blockers, and others. We are not aware of drugs currently in development for prophylactic chronic treatment of PPP. A Phase 2 clinical study of bumetanide, a loop diuretic, is underway in England for acute treatment of paralytic attacks.. Macrilen is an orally available ghrelin agonist, approved in the United States December 20, 2017 for use in the diagnosis of patients with AGHD. Arginine, an injectable product, is the only other FDA approved product indicated for use in diagnosing AGHD. However, several other products are used off-label for this use also, of which the two most frequently prescribed products are the injectables glucagon and insulin. We are not aware of any drugs currently in development for use in diagnosing AGHD.. We are currently aware of various companies that are marketing existing drugs that may compete with Recorlev such as Corcept Therapeutics and Novartis. The treatment of endogenous Cushing's syndrome patients who fail or are ineligible for surgery in the United States and Europe are: Korlym (mifepristone) marketed by Corcept Therapeutics in the United States; Signifor (pasireotide) marketed by Novartis in the United States and European Union; and ketoconazole, metyrapone and mitotane marketed by HRA in the European Union. Novartis has submitted an NDA/MAA for Signifor (pasireotide) LAR in Cushing's disease. Additionally, LCI-699 (osilodrostat) is currently in Phase 3 clinical development by Novartis in Cushing's disease patients. Corcept is developing CORT125134, a second-generation glucorticoid receptor modulator; currently in Phase 2. HRA Pharma is developing metyrapone for the US market; currently in Phase 2. Millendo is developing ATR-101, a selective acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT) inhibitor, currently in Phase 2. In addition, Ketoconazole is believed to be the most commonly prescribed drug therapy for the treatment of endogenous Cushing's syndrome, even though it is not approved for this use in the United States. Regulatory approval of ketoconazole in the United States for the treatment of endogenous Cushing's syndrome could significantly increase competition for Recorlev due to their similar mechanisms of action.. We are currently aware of various companies that are marketing existing drugs that may compete with veldoreotide such as Novartis, Ipsen and Pfizer. In addition, a number of acromegaly therapies are in various stages of development. There are currently three approved SSA therapies for acromegaly in the United States: Sandostatin LAR (octreotide) marketed by Novartis; Signifor LAR (pasireotide) marketed by Novartis; and Somatuline Depot (lanreotide) marketed by Ipsen. There is one growth hormone receptor antagonist, Somavert (pegvisomant), marketed by Pfizer. Chiasma had filed an NDA in the United States for RG-3806 (Mycapssa), an oral octreotide formulation in 2015, and received a Complete Response Letter wherein FDA stated that it did not believe the company's application had provided substantial evidence of efficacy to warrant approval, and advised Chiasma that it would need to conduct another clinical trial in order to overcome this deficiency. Four additional therapies are in Phase 2 clinical development for acromegaly: octreotide long-acting depot (CAM-2029) developed by Novartis and Camurus; ITF-2984 developed by Italfarmaco; BIM-23B065 developed by Ipsen; and ATL-1103 developed by Antisense Therapeutics.. 51. Table of Contents. We anticipate this competition to increase in the future as new companies enter the neuromuscular, endocrinology and rare diseases markets. In addition, the health care industry is characterized by rapid technological change, and new product introductions or other technological advancements could make some or all of our products obsolete.. The highly competitive nature of and rapid technological changes in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries could render our product candidates or our technology obsolete or non-competitive. Our competitors may, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thave similar or better product candidates or technologies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpossess greater financial and human resources as well as supporting clinical data;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, less expensive, or more convenient or easier to administer;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtain regulatory approval more quickly;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablish superior proprietary positions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thave access to greater manufacturing capacity;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tseek patent protection that competes with our product candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timplement more effective approaches to sales and marketing; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into more advantageous collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and marketing of products.. Additional competitors could enter the market with generic versions of our products, which may result in a decline in sales of affected products.. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may file an abbreviated new drug application (\"ANDA\"), seeking approval of a generic copy of an approved innovator product. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a manufacturer may also submit an NDA under section 505(b)(2) that references the FDA's prior approval of the innovator product. A 505(b)(2) NDA product may be for a new or improved version of the original innovator product. Hatch-Waxman also provides for certain periods of regulatory exclusivity, which preclude FDA approval, or, in some circumstances, FDA filing and reviewing, of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA. These include, subject to certain exceptions, the period during which an FDA-approved drug is subject to orphan drug exclusivity. Although Recorlev is being developed as a new chemical entity (\"NCE\"), we intend to rely on orphan drug exclusivity rather than NCE exclusivity for nonpatent protection of Recorlev. In addition to the benefits of regulatory exclusivity, an innovator NDA holder may have patents claiming the active ingredient, product formulation or an approved use of the drug, which would be listed with the product in the FDA publication, \"Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,\" known as the \"Orange Book.\" If there are patents listed in the Orange Book, a generic or 505(b)(2) applicant that seeks to market its product before expiration of the patents must include in the ANDA what is known as a \"Paragraph IV certification,\" challenging the validity or enforceability of, or claiming non-infringement of, the listed patent or patents. Notice of the certification must be given to the innovator, too, and if within 45 days of receiving notice the innovator sues to protect its patents, approval of the ANDA is stayed for 30 months, or as lengthened or shortened by the court.. Accordingly, if Recorlev or any of our other product candidates is approved, competitors could file ANDAs for generic versions of our product candidates, or 505(b)(2) NDAs that reference our product candidates, respectively. If there are patents listed for our product candidates in the Orange Book, those ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs would be required to include a certification as to each listed patent indicating whether the ANDA applicant does or does not intend to challenge the patent. We cannot predict whether any patents issuing from our pending patent applications will be eligible for listing in the Orange Book, how any generic competitor would address such patents, whether we would sue on any such patents or the outcome of any such suit.. 52. Table of Contents. We may not be successful in securing or maintaining proprietary patent protection for products and technologies we develop or license. Moreover, if any patents that are granted and listed in the Orange Book are successfully challenged by way of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent litigation, the affected product could immediately face generic competition and its sales would likely decline rapidly and materially. Should sales decline, we may have to write off a portion or all of the intangible assets associated with the affected product and our ability to generate revenue could be compromised.. The successful commercialization of our products and product candidates that are approved will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities and health insurers establish adequate coverage and reimbursement levels and pricing policies.. The successful commercialization of Keveyis, Macrilen and our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for our products will be available from government and health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. To manage healthcare costs, many governments and third-party payors increasingly scrutinize the pricing of new therapies and require greater levels of evidence of favorable clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness before extending coverage and adequate reimbursement to such new technologies. In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the \"Medicare Modernization Act\") changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly under a new Part D and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sale prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. Cost-reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and reimbursement that we receive for any approved products. While the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the Medicare Modernization Act may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. In light of such challenges to prices and increasing levels of evidence of the benefits and clinical outcomes of new technologies, we cannot be sure that coverage will be available for Keveyis, Macrilen and/or any product candidate that we commercialize, and, if available, that the reimbursement rates will be adequate. If we are unable to obtain adequate levels of coverage and reimbursement for Keveyis, Macrilen and/or our product candidates, our ability to generate revenue will be compromised.. Because each third-party payor individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time consuming, costly and sometimes unpredictable process. We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support, medical necessity or both for the use of Keveyis, Macrilen or any product to each third-party payor separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness, medical necessity or both of our products. This process could delay the market acceptance of any product and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results.. Third-party payors may deny coverage and reimbursement status altogether of a given drug product, or cover the product, but may also establish prices at levels that are too low to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Because the rules and regulations regarding coverage and reimbursement change frequently, in some cases on short notice, even when there is favorable coverage and reimbursement, future changes may occur that adversely impact such favorable coverage and reimbursement status. Further, the net reimbursement for drug products may be subject to additional reductions if there are changes to laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States.. The unavailability or inadequacy of third-party coverage and reimbursement could negatively affect the market acceptance of Keveyis, Macrilen and our product candidates and the future revenues we may expect to receive from these products. In addition, we are unable to predict what additional legislation or regulation relating to the healthcare industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future, or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business.. 53. Table of Contents. Our products may not gain market acceptance, in which case we may not be able to generate product revenues.. Even if the FDA, EMA or any comparable foreign regulatory agency approves the marketing of any product candidates that we develop, physicians, healthcare providers, patients or the medical community may not accept or use them. Efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our products or product candidates may require significant resources and may not be successful. If Keveyis, Macrilen, Recorlev, veldoreotide or any other product candidate that we develop does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues or any profits from operations. The degree of market acceptance of Keveyis, Macrilen,. Recorlev, veldoreotide or any other product candidates that are approved for commercial sale will depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhether clinicians and potential patients perceive our products or product candidates to have better efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, and ease of use compared with alternative therapies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing of market introduction;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe number of competing products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe prevalence and severity of any side effects;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trelative convenience and ease of administration;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcost - effectiveness;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpatient diagnostics and screening infrastructure in each market;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmarketing and distribution support; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tavailability of coverage, reimbursement and adequate payment from health maintenance organizations and other third - party payors, both public and private.. In addition, the potential market opportunity for Keveyis, Macrilen, Recorlev, veldoreotide or any other product candidate we may develop is difficult to estimate precisely. Our estimates of the potential market opportunity are predicated on several key assumptions such as industry knowledge and publications, third-party research reports and other surveys. While we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable, these assumptions may be inaccurate. If any of the assumptions proves to be inaccurate, then the actual market for Keveyis, Macrilen, Recorlev or our other product candidates could be smaller than our estimates of the potential market opportunity. If the actual market for Keveyis, Macrilen, Recorlev or our other product candidates is smaller than we expect, or if the products fail to achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors and patients, our product revenue may be limited and we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability. Further, given the limited number of treating physicians, if we are unable to convince a significant number of such physicians of the value of our products or product candidates, we may be unable to achieve a sufficient market share to make our products profitable.. The Orphan Drug designation for Keveyis, Macrilen and our product candidates may not prevent competition from companies that develop other compounds for the treatment of the same condition. These companies may have significantly more resources than we do. Competition from them could limit our revenue from the commercialization of Keveyis, Macrilen and/or our other product candidates.. Although Keveyis, Macrilen and our product candidates have received Orphan Drug designation in the United States, and in the case of Recorlev and veldoreotide in Europe, we cannot be assured that we will realize the potential benefits of the designation. Even after an orphan drug is approved for its orphan indication, the FDA or EMA can subsequently approve a different drug for the same condition if it concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Upon expiration of the orphan drug exclusivity period, we may be subject to competition from manufacturers offering a generic form of Keveyis, Macrilen or our other products at a lower price, in. 54.

For example, Corcept's Korlym has an Orphan Drug designation in the United States and is approved for the control of hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in patients with endogenous Cushing's syndrome who have type 2 diabetes or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery. However, in 2012 Novartis received approval in both the United States and the European Union (EU) to market its somatostatin analogue Signifor for adult patients with Cushing's disease (a subset of Cushing's syndrome that accounts for approximately 70 percent of all Cushing's syndrome patients) for whom pituitary surgery is not an option or has not been curative.. Laboratoire HRA Pharma (HRA) received Orphan Drug designation in the United States and the EU for the use of mifepristone to treat a subtype of Cushing's syndrome. HRA began and terminated a Phase 2 clinical trial in Europe and the United States for this indication. Exelgyn Laboratories, which operates as a subsidiary of Medi Challenge (Pty) Ltd., received Orphan Drug designation for mifepristone to treat Cushing's syndrome in the EU, but it has stated that it has not yet conducted any clinical trials.. The terms of our credit facility place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility.. Our term loan agreement with CRG includes affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us and any subsidiaries we create in the future. The affirmative covenants include, among others, covenants requiring us to maintain our legal existence and governmental approvals necessary for us and our subsidiaries to perform our respective businesses and obligations under the term loan agreement, deliver certain financial reports to the lenders, maintain insurance coverage, and comply with certain financial covenants. The negative covenants include, among others, restrictions on our transferring collateral, changing our business, engaging in mergers or acquisitions, incurring additional indebtedness, paying dividends or making other distributions, making investments, creating liens, or entering into transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to certain exceptions.. The term loan agreement also includes events of default, the occurrence and continuation of which could cause interest to be charged at the rate that is otherwise applicable plus 4.0% and would provide the lenders holding more than 50% of the aggregate commitments under the credit facility, and CRG, as collateral agent, with the right to exercise remedies against us and the collateral securing the credit facility, including foreclosure against our assets securing the credit facility, including our cash. These events of default include, among others, our failure to pay any amounts due under the term loan agreement, a breach of covenants under the term loan agreement, a material adverse change, our insolvency, the occurrence of a default under any material agreement with a third party, and/or one or more judgments are rendered against us or our subsidiaries in an amount greater than $250,000 individually or in the aggregate.. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and ability to raise additional sources of cash, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring our debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. If we desire to refinance our indebtedness, our ability to do so will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.. Risks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties. We have no manufacturing capabilities and currently depend on one supplier to manufacture Keveyis and a single set of suppliers to manufacture Macrilen. We also depend on a limited number of other suppliers to manufacture our product candidates for use in clinical trials. If these suppliers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing for us and we are unable to contract quickly with alternative sources, or if these third-party manufacturers fail to comply with FDA regulations or otherwise fail to meet our requirements, our business will be harmed.. Taro Pharmaceuticals North America, Inc. produces all of our requirements for Keveyis. We rely on a single set of suppliers to produce all of our requirements for Macrilen. We rely on other third-parties to manufacture our product. 55. Table of Contents. candidates for use in clinical trials. If any of these vendors is unable or unwilling to meet our future requirements, we may not be able to manufacture our products in a timely manner. Our current arrangements with these manufacturers are terminable by such manufacturers, subject to certain notice provisions.. The facilities used by our vendors to manufacture our product and product candidates must be approved by the FDA. We do not control the manufacturing processes of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with the regulatory requirements known as current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs). If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our products or if it withdraws any such approval, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly hamper our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our products. In addition, sanctions could be imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could harm our business. If our suppliers fail to manufacture Keveyis, Macrilen or our product candidates on a timely basis in the quantities that we require, or fail to maintain manufacturing capabilities that meet FDA standards, we may exhaust our Keveyis and/or Macrilen inventory and not be able to generate revenue, or clinical development programs may be delayed.. We and our collaborators and contract manufacturers are subject to significant regulation with respect to the manufacturing of Keveyis, Macrilen and our product candidates. The manufacturing facilities on which we rely may not continue to meet regulatory requirements or may not be able to meet supply demands.. All entities involved in the preparation of therapeutics for clinical trials or commercial sale, including our existing contract manufacturers for our products and product candidates, are subject to extensive regulation. Components of a finished therapeutic product approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures, including record keeping, and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Poor control of production processes can lead to the introduction of contaminants or to inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of our product candidates that may not be detectable in final product testing. We, our collaborators or our contract manufacturers must supply all necessary documentation in support of an NDA or foreign equivalent on a timely basis and must adhere to GLP and cGMP regulations enforced by the FDA and other regulatory agencies through their facilities inspection program. Some of our contract manufacturers have never produced a commercially-approved pharmaceutical product and therefore have not obtained the requisite regulatory authority approvals to do so. The facilities and quality systems of some or all of our collaborators and third-party contractors must pass a pre-approval inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of regulatory approval of our product candidates or any of our other potential products. In addition, the regulatory authorities may, at any time, audit or inspect a manufacturing facility involved with the preparation of our product candidates or our other potential products or the associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted. Although we oversee the contract manufacturers, we cannot control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with the regulatory requirements. If these facilities do not pass a pre-approval plant inspection, regulatory approval of the products may not be granted or may be substantially delayed until any violations are corrected to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority, if ever.. The regulatory authorities also may, at any time following approval of a product for sale, audit the manufacturing facilities of our collaborators and third-party contractors. If any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulations occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we or the relevant regulatory authority may require remedial measures that may be costly and/or time consuming for us or a third party to implement, and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or commercial sales or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility.. 56. Table of Contents. If we, our collaborators or any of our third-party manufacturers fail to maintain regulatory compliance, the FDA or another applicable regulatory authority could impose regulatory sanctions including, among other things, refusal to approve a pending application our product candidates, withdrawal of an approval or suspension of production.. Additionally, if the supply from one approved manufacturer is interrupted, an alternative manufacturer would need to be qualified through an NDA supplement or equivalent foreign regulatory filing, which could result in further delay. The regulatory agencies may also require additional studies if a new manufacturer is relied upon for commercial production. Switching manufacturers may involve substantial costs and is likely to result in a delay in our desired clinical and commercial timelines.. These factors could cause us to incur higher costs and could cause the delay or termination of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of our product candidates. Furthermore, if our suppliers fail to meet contractual requirements and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, our clinical trials may be delayed or we could lose potential revenue.. We rely on third parties to conduct our nonclinical and clinical trials and if these third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, our business could be substantially harmed.. We have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-party CROs to conduct and monitor and manage data for our ongoing nonclinical and clinical programs, and may not currently have all of the necessary contractual relationships in place to do so. Once we have established contractual relationships with such third-party CROS, we will have only limited control over their actual performance of these activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory, environmental and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.. We and our CROs and other vendors are required to comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices (\"cGMP\"), current Good Clinical Practices (\"cGCP\"), and Good Laboratory Practice (\"GLP\"), which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Union and any comparable foreign regulatory agency for all of our product candidates in nonclinical and clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these regulations through periodic inspections of study sponsors, principal investigators, trial sites and other contractors. If we or any of our CROs or vendors fail to comply with applicable regulations, the data generated in our nonclinical and clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, EMA or any comparable foreign regulatory agency may require us to perform additional nonclinical and clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that all of our clinical trials comply with cGCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with products produced under cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.. Our business involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biologicals and radioactive compounds. Substantially all such use is outsourced to third-party CRO manufacturers and clinical sites. Although we believe that our third-party CROs safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with industry standards, there will always be a risk of accidental contamination or injury. By law, radioactive materials may only be disposed of at certain approved facilities. If liable for an accident, or if it suffers an extended facility shutdown, we or our CROs could incur significant costs, damages or penalties.. Our CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing nonclinical and clinical programs. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. Our CROs may also generate higher costs than anticipated. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.. 57. Table of Contents. If any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminates, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. If we are able to replace a CRO, switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus and there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays could occur, which could hurt our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future.. Our reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.. Because we rely on third parties to develop and manufacture our product candidates, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, collaborative research agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees, and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, such as trade secrets. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor's discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may harm our business.. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property. If we or our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain effective patent or license rights for our technologies, product candidates or any future product candidates, or if the scope of the patent or license rights obtained is not sufficiently broad, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.. In addition to the exclusivity provided for Keveyis, Macrilen and our product candidates with regulatory orphan drug status, we rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection, license rights and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our technologies and product candidates. Our success depends in large part on our and our licensors' ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection in the United States and in other countries, as well as license rights, with respect to our proprietary technology, products and product candidates.. We have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing, where possible, patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner or in all jurisdictions. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development and manufacturing processes before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances, we do not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from third parties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.. The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which legal principles remain unsolved. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our products or product candidates in the United States or in foreign countries. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions remain confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our products or product candidates, or whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned patents or pending patent applications, nor can we know whether those from whom we license patents were the first to make the inventions claimed or were the first to file. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability. 58. Table of Contents. and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. There is no assurance that all potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, which can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Even if patents do successfully issue, and even if such patents cover our products or product candidates, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed, found unenforceable or invalidated, which could allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our products or product candidates, prevent others from designing around our claims or provide us with a competitive advantage. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties.. We and/or our licensors or partners have filed several patent applications covering various aspects of our products and product candidates. We cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue, the breadth of any such patent, or whether any issued patents will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be challenged by third parties. Any successful opposition to these patents or any other patents owned by or licensed to us after patent issuance, or the loss or other impairment of any license rights relating to our products or product candidates, could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of any products or product candidates that we may develop. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a product or product candidate under patent protection could be reduced.. We may not have sufficient patent terms to effectively protect our products and business.. Patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is first filed. Although various extensions may be available, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such product candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours or otherwise provide us with a competitive advantage. Even if patents covering our products or product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition from generic medications.. Although patent term extensions in the United States and under supplementary protection certificates in the European Union may be available to extend the patent exclusivity term for our products or product candidates, we cannot provide any assurances that any such patent term extension will be obtained and, if so, for how long.. Patent policy and rule changes could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, in the United States prior to March 15, 2013, the first to invent the claimed invention is entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application is entitled to the patent. After March 15, 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the \"AIA\"), enacted on September 16, 2011, the United States has moved to a first inventor to file system. The AIA also includes a number of significant changes that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The effects of these changes are currently unclear as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the \"USPTO\") is still implementing various regulations, the courts have yet to address many of these provisions and the applicability of the act and new regulations on specific patents discussed herein have not been determined and would need to be reviewed. In general, the AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. In addition, recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the. 59. Table of Contents. federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.. Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement may expose us to substantial liability or prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.. Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell Keveyis, Macrilen and our product candidates, if approved, and use our proprietary technology without alleged or actual infringement, misappropriation or other violation of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There have been many lawsuits and other proceedings involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO, and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we will market Keveyis and Macrilen and are developing product candidates. Some claimants may have substantially greater resources than we do and may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could. In addition, patent holding companies that focus solely on extracting royalties and settlements by enforcing patent rights may target us. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our products and product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties.. Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to compositions, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods of treatment related to the use or manufacture of Keveyis, Macrilen or our product candidates. We cannot be sure that we know of each and every patent and pending application in the United States and abroad that is relevant or necessary to the commercialization of Keveyis, Macrilen or our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents upon which our products or product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our products or product candidates, any compositions formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product or product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or are finally determined to be invalid or unenforceable. Similarly, if any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our compositions, formulations, or methods of treatment, prevention or use, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product or product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be invalid or unenforceable. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us.. Parties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize Keveyis, Macrilen or one or more of our product candidates, if approved. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys' fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure.. Although we are not currently involved in any litigation, we may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.. Competitors may infringe upon our patents or the patents of our licensors. Although we are not currently involved in any litigation, if we or one of our licensing partners were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our products or product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent. 60. Table of Contents. covering our product or product candidate is invalid and/or unenforceable, or request declaratory judgment that there is no infringement. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity, noninfringement and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, nonobviousness or non-lack of enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld material relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable.. Interference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs, and distract our management and other employees. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could compromise our ability to successfully market Keveyis and/or Macrilen raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, and license necessary technology from third parties or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market, if approved.. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could hurt the market price of our ordinary shares.. Failure to secure or maintain adequate protection for our trademarks could adversely affect our business.. We have filed a U.S., Canadian, Brazilian and International (Madrid Protocol) trademark application designating Australia, China, European Community, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico and Turkey for the mark, \"Strongbridge Biopharma.\" If the U.S. or any foreign trademark offices raise any objections, we may be unable to overcome such objections. In addition, in the USPTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Oppositions or cancellation proceedings have been filed and may in the future be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings.. Furthermore, third parties may allege in the future, that a trademark or trade name that we elect to use for our product candidates may cause confusion in the marketplace. We evaluate such potential allegations in the course of our business, and such evaluations may cause us to change our commercialization or branding strategy for our product candidates, which may require us to incur additional costs. Moreover, any name we propose to use with our product candidate in the United States must be approved by the FDA, regardless of whether we have registered it, or applied to register it, as a trademark. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed proprietary product names, we may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable substitute name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA.. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks, domain names or copyrights may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks alleging that the use of a corporate name or logo, product names or other signs by which we. 61. Table of Contents. distinguish our products and services are infringing their trademark rights. The outcome of such claims is uncertain and may adversely affect our freedom to use our corporate name or other relevant signs. If litigation arises in this area, it may lead to significant costs and diversion of management and employee attention.. We may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties or that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.. We may employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, and we are not currently subject to any claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties, we may in the future be subject to such claims. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.. We may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patents and other intellectual property.. Although we are not currently experiencing any claims challenging the inventorship of our patents or ownership of our intellectual property, we may in the future be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our patents or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. For example, we may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on our products or product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Further, licensing partners may not prosecute patents in certain jurisdictions in which we may obtain commercial rights, thereby precluding the possibility of later obtaining patent protection in these countries. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.. 62. Table of Contents. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.. Risks Related to Government Oversight and Regulation. We will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory requirements, which may result in significant additional expense.. Keveyis, Macrilen and any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval will remain subject to continual regulatory review. Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. In addition, if the FDA, the EMA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority approves any of our product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight by regulatory authorities, including with respect to the manufacturing processes, labeling, packing, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising and marketing restrictions, and recordkeeping and, potentially, other post-marketing obligations, all of which may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize such products. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMPs and cGCPs for any clinical trials that we conduct post-regulatory approval. Because our two Phase 3 clinical trials of Recorlev will collect safety data for approximately 125 patients, we currently expect that we would be required by the FDA and the EMA to collect additional safety data post-approval.. In addition, approved products, manufacturers and manufacturers' facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twithdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfines, disgorgement of profits or revenues, warning letters or holds on clinical trials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trefusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuspension or revocation of product approvals;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.. If any of these events occurs, our ability to sell such product may be impaired, and we may incur substantial additional expense to comply with regulatory requirements. The policies of the FDA, the EMA or any comparable foreign regulatory agency may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any regulatory approval that we may have obtained, which would compromise our ability to achieve or sustain profitability.. 63. Table of Contents. Although we have obtained orphan drug designation for Keveyis, Macrilen and our key product candidates from the FDA and EMA, orphan drug designation may not ensure that we will enjoy market exclusivity in a particular market, and if we fail to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for Keveyis, Macrilen or our product candidates, we may be subject to earlier competition and our potential revenue will be reduced.. Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat an orphan disease or condition, defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the European Union, the EMA's Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug or biological product or where there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.. In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan drug designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity. In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as a reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.. Keveyis has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of hyperkalemic, hypokalemic, and related variants of PPP in the United States. Macrilen has been granted orphan drug designation for the diagnosis of AGHD. Recorlev has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of endogenous Cushing's syndrome in the United States and Europe. Veldoreotide has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of acromegaly in the United States and in Europe. Even though we have obtained orphan drug designation for our key product candidates, we may not be the first to obtain regulatory approval for any particular orphan indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products. For example, ketoconazole was granted orphan drug exclusivity in Europe and is now being marketed for the treatment of endogenous Cushing's syndrome. Therefore, Recorlev will need to show significant benefit compared to ketoconazole in order to be marketed in Europe prior to the expiration of the ketoconazole orphan drug exclusivity. Further, even though we have obtained orphan drug designation for our key product candidates, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.. Enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize our product candidates, and may affect the prices we may set.. In the United States and the European Union, there have been a number of legislative, regulatory and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system. These changes could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect our ability to sell profitably any products for which we obtain regulatory approval and begin to commercialize.. As a result of legislative proposals and the trend toward managed health care in the United States, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. In the United States, the Medicare Modernization Act changed the way Medicare covers and pays for. 64. Table of Contents. pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly under a new Part D and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sale prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. Cost-reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and reimbursement that we receive for any approved products. While the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow the Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the Medicare Modernization Act may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, a sweeping law intended, among other things, to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry, and impose additional health policy reforms. PPACA, among other things: increased the statutory minimum Medicaid rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; and established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program in which manufacturers must provide 50% point-of-sale discounts on negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Part D and implemented payment system reforms, including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Further, the PPACA imposed a significant annual nondeductible fee on entities that manufacture or import specified branded prescription drug products and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs. We expect that additional healthcare reform measures will likely be adopted in the future, any of which may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs and limit the amounts that federal, state and foreign governments will reimburse for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products, if approved, or additional pricing pressures.. Moreover, other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted in the United States since PPACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021 was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could compromise the ability of patients and third-party payors to purchase our product candidates.. In 2017, the U.S. Congress has been assessing new legislation designed to repeal and replace core sections of the PPACA. We expect the U.S. Congress to continue to review and assess this legislation, referred to as the American Health Care Act (AHCA), along with other alternative health care reform proposals throughout 2017. Recent Congressional efforts such as the AHCA proposal adds to the uncertainty of the legislative changes enacted as part of PPACA. These changes will likely take time to unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the PPACA. There is no assurance that the PPACA, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.. In the European Union, proposed new clinical trial regulations will centralize clinical trial approval, which eliminates redundancy, but in some cases this may extend timelines for clinical trial approvals due to potentially longer wait times. Proposals to require specific consents for use of data in research, among other measures, may increase the. 65. Table of Contents. costs and timelines for our product development efforts. Austerity measures in certain European nations may also affect the prices we are able to seek if our products are approved, as discussed below.. Both in the United States and in the European Union, legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We do not know whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, whether the regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the regulatory approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be.. Pricing for pharmaceutical products has come under increasing scrutiny by governments, legislative bodies and enforcement agencies. These activities may result in actions that have the effect of reducing our revenue or harming our business or reputation.. Pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to enhanced government and public scrutiny and calls for reform. There has recently been intense publicity regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical products generally, including publicity and pressure resulting from the prices charged for new products as well as price increases for older products that the government and public deem excessive. We may experience downward pricing pressure on the price of our products due to social or political pressure to lower the cost of drugs, which could reduce our revenue and future profitability. Many companies in our industry have received governmental requests for documents and information relating to drug pricing and patient support programs. On December 19, 2017, we received letters from the offices of United States Senators Amy Klobuchar, Susan Collins and Tammy Baldwin, and Senator Claire McCaskill, Ranking member of Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, that request information relating to the marketing and sales of Keveyis. The letters request information principally relating to the pricing of Keveyis, among other things. We are cooperating with these voluntary requests for information. We could incur significant expense and experience reputational harm as a result of these or other similar future inquiries, as well as reduced market acceptance and demand for our products, which could harm our ability to market our products in the future. These factors could also result in changes in our product pricing and distribution strategies, reduced demand for our products and/or reduced reimbursement of products, including by federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and state health care programs. In addition, the Trump Administration has indicated an interest in taking measures pertaining to drug pricing, including potential proposals relating to Medicare price negotiations, and importation of drugs from other countries. At this time, it is unclear whether any of these proposals will be pursued and how they would impact our products or our future product candidates.. Our relationships with customers, consultants and payors will be subject to applicable fraud and abuse, privacy and security, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which, if violated, could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, exclusion from government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.. Healthcare providers, physicians and others play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we may in the future obtain regulatory approval and commercialize. Our current and future arrangements with third - party payors, consultants, customers, physicians and others may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare federal and state laws and regulations, including in the United States, that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain regulatory approval. Potentially applicable healthcare laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe U.S. federal Anti - Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering, arranging for, or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under U.S. government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, which prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal. 66. Table of Contents. government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Privacy Rule or the Security Rule of HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which impose various obligations with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe health care fraud provisions of HIPAA, which impose criminal liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third - party payors, or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act under PPACA and its implementing regulations, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to annually report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value made by such manufacturers to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians or their immediate family members; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tanalogous laws and regulations, such as state anti - kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements, research, distribution and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by state governmental and non - governmental third - party payors, including private insurers, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, and state requirements for manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures and other restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices.. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute and analogous state laws, it is possible that some of our current and future business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to be in violation. Moreover, PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act.. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to, without limitation, significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from U.S. government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, disgorgement, enhanced government reporting and oversight, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses or divert our management's attention from the operations of our business. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar penalties, including, without limitation, criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government-funded healthcare programs.. 67. Table of Contents. We are subject to U.S. and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Compliance with these legal standards could impair our ability to compete in domestic and international markets. We can face criminal liability and other serious consequences for violations which can harm our business.. We are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Controls, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C.  201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors and other partners from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector. We may engage third parties for clinical trials outside of the United States, to sell our products abroad once we enter a commercialization phase and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations and other regulatory approvals. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities and other organizations. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, agents, contractors and other partners, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm and other consequences.. Risks Related to Our Ordinary Shares. The price of our ordinary shares may be volatile and may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control.. The market price of our ordinary shares may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trevenues from sales of Keveyis and Macrilen;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpositive or negative results of testing and clinical trials by us, strategic partners or competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelays in in - licensing or acquiring additional complementary product candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany delay in the commencement, enrollment and the ultimate completion of clinical trials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttechnological innovations or commercial product introductions by us or competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure to successfully develop and commercialize any of our product candidates, if approved;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in government regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelopments concerning proprietary rights, including patents and litigation matters;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpublic concern relating to the commercial value or safety of any of our product candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfinancing or other corporate transactions, or inability to obtain additional funding;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure to meet or exceed expectations of the investment community;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements of significant licenses, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures by us or our competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpublication of research reports or comments by securities or industry analysts; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral market conditions in the pharmaceutical industry or in the economy as a whole.. 68. Table of Contents. The share price of publicly traded emerging biopharmaceutical and drug discovery and development companies has been highly volatile and is likely to remain highly volatile in the future. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. Broad market and industry factors may hurt the market price of companies' stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance.. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, the price of our ordinary shares and our trading volume could decline.. The trading market for our ordinary shares depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If too few securities or industry analysts commence or continue coverage of our company, the trading price for our ordinary shares would likely be negatively affected. In the event securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our ordinary shares or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our ordinary shares would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our ordinary shares could decrease, which might cause the price of our ordinary shares and trading volume to decline.. Future sales, or the possibility of future sales, of a substantial number of our ordinary shares could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares.. Future sales of a substantial number of our ordinary shares, or the perception that such sales will occur, could cause a decline in the market price of our ordinary shares. We currently have 45,504,848 ordinary shares outstanding. We have also filed a Registration Statement on Form S-8, registering ordinary shares that we may issue under our equity compensation plans. These ordinary shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates and the lock-up agreements. If a large number of our ordinary shares or securities convertible into our ordinary shares are sold in the public market after they become eligible for sale, the sales could reduce the trading price of our ordinary shares and impede our ability to raise future capital.. An active market in our ordinary shares may not be liquid enough for investors to resell our ordinary shares.. The listing of our ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market does not assure that a meaningful, consistent and liquid trading market exists. In general trading volume in our ordinary shares has been limited and an active trading market for our shares may not be sustained. If an active market for our ordinary shares is not sustained, it may be difficult for investors to sell their shares without depressing the market price for the shares or at all.. We have never paid cash dividends, do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future and our ability to pay dividends, or repurchase or redeem our ordinary shares, is limited by law.. We have not paid any dividends since our inception and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. Even if future operations lead to significant levels of distributable profits, we currently intend that any earnings will be reinvested in our business and that dividends will not be paid until we have an established revenue stream to support continuing dividends. The proposal to pay future dividends to shareholders will in addition effectively be at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors our board of directors deems relevant, including our business prospects, capital requirements, financial performance and new product development. In addition, payment of future dividends is subject to certain limitations under the Irish Companies Act 2014 (the \"Irish Companies Act\"). The Irish Companies Act, among other requirements, requires Irish companies to have distributable reserves available for distribution equal to or greater than the amount of the proposed dividend. Accordingly, investors cannot rely on dividend income from our ordinary shares and any returns on an investment in our ordinary shares will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation in the price of our ordinary shares.. 69. Table of Contents. We believe we were classified as a passive foreign investment company (\"PFIC\") for U.S. federal income tax purposes in past years and we may be classified as a PFIC in future years , which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders of our ordinary shares.. A non-U.S. corporation generally will be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year if either (1) 75% or more of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of \"passive\" income or (2) 50% or more of the value of its assets (determined on the basis of a quarterly average) during such year produce or are held for the production of passive income. For this purpose, \"passive income\" generally includes, among other items of income, dividends, interest, royalties, rents and gains from commodities and securities transactions and from the sale or exchange of property that gives rise to passive income, and a non-U.S. corporation is treated as owning a proportionate share of the assets and earning a proportionate share of the income of any other corporation in which such non-U.S. corporation owns, directly or indirectly, more than 25% of the value of such other corporation's stock. Based on our income, assets and activities in past years, we believe that we were a PFIC in past years, and we may be classified as a PFIC for the current taxable year and for future years depending on the income, assets, and activities in such taxable years. A U.S. Holder that holds ordinary shares during any taxable year in which we are a PFIC would be subject to substantially increased U.S. federal income tax liability, including upon the receipt of any \"excess distributions\" from us and upon the sale or other disposition of our ordinary shares. Although certain elections may be available to mitigate the adverse impact of the PFIC rules, such elections may result in a current U.S. federal tax liability prior to any distribution on or disposition of our ordinary shares. Further, there can be no assurances that we will supply U.S. Holders with information that such U.S. Holders are required to report under the rules governing such elections. Accordingly, the acquisition of our ordinary shares may not be an appropriate investment for certain holders that are not tax-exempt organizations. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the application of the PFIC rules to an investment in our ordinary shares.. As of January 1, 2018, we are required to comply with the Exchange Act's domestic reporting regime and Nasdaq's requirements for domestic issuers, which may cause us to incur increased legal, accounting and other expenses.. Prior to January 1, 2018, we were a foreign private issuer and were, therefore, not required to comply with the periodic disclosure and current reporting requirements of the Exchange Act applicable to U.S. domestic issuers. As of the end of our second fiscal quarter in 2017, however, we determined that we no longer satisfied the eligibility requirements of a foreign private issuer. As a result, effective January 1, 2018 we are required to comply with all of the periodic disclosure and current reporting requirements of the Exchange Act applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, and are no longer eligible for certain exemptions from Nasdaq's corporate governance requirements. The Exchange Act's disclosure and reporting requirements for domestic issuers are generally more detailed and extensive than the requirements for foreign private issuers. To satisfy these requirements, we may be required to make changes to our corporate governance practices to comply with SEC and stock exchange rules. The costs for us to comply with these regulatory requirements may be significantly higher than the costs we have generally incurred as a foreign private issuer. Further, we are now subject to procedural requirements, including Nasdaq rules requiring shareholder approval for certain types of equity offerings, that may impede our ability to conduct certain types of financings or otherwise delay our ability to take corporate actions. We also expect that complying with the rules and regulations applicable to domestic issuers may make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors.. Our shareholder's rights are governed by Irish law and differ from the rights of shareholders under U.S. law.. We are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of Ireland. Therefore, the rights of holders of ordinary shares are governed by Irish law and by our memorandum and articles of association. These rights differ from the typical rights of shareholders in U.S. corporations. In certain cases, facts that, under U.S. law, would entitle a shareholder in a U.S. corporation to claim damages may not give rise to a cause of action under Irish law entitling a shareholder in an Irish company to claim damages. For example, the rights of shareholders to bring proceedings against us or against our directors or officers in relation to public statements are more limited under Irish law than under the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws.. 70. Table of Contents. Our shareholders may have difficulties enforcing, in actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the United States, judgments obtained in the U.S. courts under the U.S. securities laws. In particular, if a shareholder sought to bring proceedings in Ireland based on U.S. securities laws, the Irish court might consider that:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tit did not have jurisdiction;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tit was not the appropriate forum for such proceedings;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tapplying Irish conflict of laws rules, U.S. laws (including U.S. securities laws) did not apply to the relationship between you and us or our directors and officers; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe U.S. securities laws were of a penal nature or violated Irish public policy and should not be enforced by the Irish court.. Our shareholders should also be aware that Irish law does not allow for any form of legal proceedings directly equivalent to the class action available in the United States.. Because the PCAOB is not permitted to inspect registered public accounting firms in Ireland, you do not have the benefit of such inspections to the extent our financial statements are audited by a registered public accounting firm in Ireland.. Auditors of U.S. public companies, including our independent registered public accounting firm, are required by the laws of the United States to undergo periodic PCAOB inspections to assess their compliance with U.S. law and professional standards in connection with performance of audits of financial statements filed with the SEC. The laws of certain European Union countries, including Ireland, do not currently permit the PCAOB to conduct inspections of accounting firms established and operating in such European Union countries. Accordingly, to the extent our financial statements will be audited by a registered public accounting firm in Ireland, the PCAOB would be prevented from fully evaluating the effectiveness of our independent registered public accounting firm's audit procedures or quality control procedures. Unlike shareholders or potential shareholders of most U.S. public companies, our shareholders would be deprived of the possible benefits of such PCAOB inspections.. A future transfer of our ordinary shares, other than one effected by means of the transfer of book-entry interests in DTC, may be subject to Irish stamp duty.. The rate of Irish stamp duty, when applicable, on the transfer of shares in an Irish-incorporated company is 1% of the price paid, or the market value of the shares acquired, whichever is greater. Payment of Irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee. We expect that most of our ordinary shares will be traded through the Depositary Trust Company (\"DTC\"), or through brokers who hold such shares on behalf of customers through DTC. As such, the transfer of ordinary shares should be exempt from Irish stamp duty based on established practice of the Irish Revenue Commissioners. We received written confirmation from the Irish Revenue Commissioners on June 22, 2015 that a transfer of our ordinary shares held through DTC and transferred by means of a book-entry interest would be exempt from Irish stamp duty. However, if you hold your ordinary shares directly of record, rather than beneficially through DTC, or through a broker that holds your ordinary shares through DTC, any transfer of your ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty. The potential for Irish stamp duty to arise could adversely affect the price and liquidity of our ordinary shares. In addition, the terms of our eligibility agreement with DTC requires us to provide certain indemnities relating to Irish stamp duty to third parties. If liability were to arise as a result of the indemnities provided under the terms of the eligibility agreement, we may face significant unexpected costs.. Anti-takeover provisions in our Articles and under Irish law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current directors and management team, and limit the market price of our ordinary shares.. Our Articles contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change of control, discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our ordinary shares and adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares and the voting. 71. Table of Contents. and other rights of the holders of our ordinary shares. These provisions include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdividing our board of directors into three classes, with each class serving a staggered three - year term;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpermitting our board of directors to issue preference shares without shareholder approval, with such rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovisions which allow our board of directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan upon such terms and conditions as it deems expedient and in our best interests;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablishing an advance notice procedure for shareholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability of our board of directors to fill vacancies on our board in certain circumstances.. These provisions do not make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management team by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.. Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States with respect to defending unwanted takeover proposals and may give our board of directors less ability to control negotiations with hostile offerors.. We are subject to the Irish Takeover Rules. Under the Irish Takeover Rules, our board of directors is not permitted to take any action that might frustrate an offer for our ordinary shares once our board of directors has received an approach that may lead to an offer or has reason to believe that such an offer is or may be imminent, subject to certain exceptions. Potentially frustrating actions such as (1) the issue of shares, options, restricted share units or convertible securities, (2) material acquisitions or disposals, (3) entering into contracts other than in the ordinary course of business or (4) any action, other than seeking alternative offers, which may result in frustration of an offer, are prohibited during the course of an offer or at any earlier time during which our board of directors has reason to believe an offer is or may be imminent. These provisions may give our board of directors less ability to control negotiations with hostile offerors than would be the case for a corporation incorporated in the United States.. We are an \"emerging growth company,\" and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to \"emerging growth companies\" will make our ordinary shares less attractive to investors.. We are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an \"emerging growth company,\" we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \"emerging growth companies,\" including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, exemptions from the requirements to provide certain executive compensation disclosures, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation or seeking shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As an \"emerging growth company,\" in our initial registration statement, we were required to report only two years of financial results and selected financial data compared to three and five years, respectively, for comparable data reported by other public companies. We could be an \"emerging growth company\" for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an \"emerging growth company\" as of the following December 31, our fiscal year end. We cannot predict if investors will find our ordinary shares less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our ordinary shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our ordinary shares and the price of our ordinary shares may be more volatile.. 72. Table of Contents. Certain provisions of the warrants issued in our 2016 private placement could impede a sale of the company.. In the event of a sale of the company, the terms of the warrants issued to investors in our December 2016 private placement require us to use our best efforts to ensure the holders of such warrants will have a continuing right to purchase shares of the acquirer and, if our efforts are unsuccessful, to make a payment to such warrant holders based on a Black-Scholes valuation (using variables as specified in the warrant agreements). Such payment must be made in cash in the event that the acquisition results in our shareholders receiving cash from the acquirer at the closing of the transaction, and must be made in shares of the Company (with the value of each ordinary share determined according to the calculation specified in the warrant agreements) in the event that the acquisition results in our shareholders receiving shares in the acquirer or other entity at the closing of the transaction. In the event that our shareholders receive both cash and shares at the closing of the transaction, such payment to the warrant holders shall also be made in both cash and shares in the same proportion as the consideration received by the shareholders.. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that as a result of an acquisition the warrants will be exercisable for anything other than shares or securities that are listed on a regulated market (within the meaning of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (2004/39(EC))) or a United States national securities exchange, the warrant holders will be entitled to demand to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to the Black-Scholes Value per warrant (calculated in accordance with the warrants) contemporaneously with or promptly after the consummation of such acquisition."
