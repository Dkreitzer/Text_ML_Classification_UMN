[1] "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.. Risks relating to our business. Unforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems could have an adverse effect on our operations and if internal controls are not designed and operated effectively our internal control over financial reporting could be ineffective.. As a part of our efforts to upgrade our current information systems, early in fiscal 2015 we began the process of designing and implementing new enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and other software applications to manage our operations. The software applications are expected to continue to be implemented in phases over the next year. As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen, including interruptions in service, loss of data, or reduced functionality. Such problems could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders, ship orders timely, pay employees properly, and otherwise run our business in a timely manner. In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures, it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins. As such, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Such matters could lead to the loss of customers, damage to our reputation, litigation, and declines in our stock price.. In addition, the new ERP software and other applications that we are implementing are new to our organization. We do not have experience with implementing and maintaining controls over these new systems. If we are unable to design controls within or around these systems that are effective at preventing and detecting unreliable data, or if we are unable to design or operate controls within or around these systems to provide effective control around program changes and access to the systems, we may be at risk for future material weaknesses. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, which could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock.. Within the last five years we have restated our consolidated financial statements, which may lead to additional risks and uncertainties, including shareholder litigation, loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our stock price.. In May 2014, we restated our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 and for the quarterly periods within the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 and 2012. The determination to restate these consolidated financial statements and the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements was made by our Audit and Compliance Committee upon management's recommendation following the identification of errors related to our method of recognizing revenues on two contracts at one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We. 16. Table of Contents. previously restated our historical financial statements in 2012 following the identification of errors, which related primarily to the misapplication of GAAP for certain methods of revenue recognition.. The fact that we have completed two restatements in the last five years may lead to a loss of investor confidence and have negative impacts on the trading price of our common stock.. Our business and stock price may be adversely affected if our internal control over financial reporting is not effective.. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Management's assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2013, identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to accounting for revenue of one of our significant wholly owned subsidiaries. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In fiscal 2014, we developed and implemented new control procedures over financial reporting related to accounting for revenue for this significant wholly owned subsidiary, and we concluded that we had remediated this material weakness as of September 30, 2014. However, we cannot assure you that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent additional material weaknesses or other deficiencies in the future. We may be at risk for future material weaknesses, particularly if these new procedures do not operate effectively. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, which could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock.. We depend on government contracts for substantially all of our revenues and the loss of government contracts or a delay or decline in funding of existing or future government contracts could decrease our backlog or adversely affect our sales and cash flows and our ability to fund our growth.. Our revenues from contracts, directly or indirectly, with foreign and U.S. state, regional and local governmental agencies represented substantially all of our total revenues in fiscal year 2017. Although these various government agencies are subject to common budgetary pressures and other factors, many of our various government customers exercise independent purchasing decisions. As a result of the concentration of business with governmental agencies, we are vulnerable to adverse changes in our revenues, income and cash flows if a significant number of our government contracts, subcontracts or prospects are delayed or canceled for budgetary or other reasons.. The factors that could cause us to lose these contracts and could decrease our backlog or otherwise materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbudget constraints affecting government spending generally, or specific departments or agencies such as U.S. or foreign defense and transit agencies and regional transit agencies, and changes in fiscal policies or a reduction of available funding;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tre-allocation of government resources as the result of actual or threatened terrorism or hostile activities or for other reasons;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisruptions in our customers' ability to access funding from capital markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcurtailment of governments' use of outsourced service providers and governments' in-sourcing of certain services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe adoption of new laws or regulations pertaining to government procurement;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgovernment appropriations delays or blanket reductions in departmental budgets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuspension or prohibition from contracting with the government or any significant agency with which we conduct business;. 17. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased use of shorter duration awards by the federal government in the defense industry, which increases the frequency we may need to compete for work;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timpairment of our reputation or relationships with any significant government agency with which we conduct business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased use of small business set asides by government agencies, resulting in Cubic being eligible to perform no more than 49% of the work as a subcontractor;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased use of lowest-priced, technically acceptable contract award criteria by government agencies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased aggressiveness by the government in seeking rights in technical data, computer software, and computer software documentation that we deliver under a contract, which may result in \"leveling the playing field\" for competitors on follow-on procurements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timpairment of our ability to provide third-party guarantees and letters of credit; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelays in the payment of our invoices by government payment offices.. In addition, some of our international work is done at the request and at the expense of the U.S. government and its agencies. Therefore, risks associated with performing work for the U.S. government and its agencies may also apply to our international contracts.. Government spending priorities and terms may change in a manner adverse to our businesses.. At times, our businesses have been adversely affected by significant changes in U.S. and foreign government spending during periods of declining budgets. A significant decline in overall spending, or the decision not to exercise options to renew contracts, or the loss of or substantial decline in spending on a large program in which we participate could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. For example, the U.S. defense and national security budgets in general, and spending in specific agencies with which we work, such as those that are a part of the DoD, have declined from time to time for extended periods, resulting in program delays, program cancellations and a slowing of new program starts. Future levels of expenditures and authorizations for defense-related programs by the U.S. and foreign governments may decrease, remain constant or shift to programs in areas where we do not currently provide products or services, thereby reducing the chances that we will be awarded new contracts.. Even though our contract periods of performance for a program may exceed one year, Congress and certain foreign governments must usually approve funds for a given program each fiscal year and may significantly reduce funding of a program in a particular year. Significant reductions in these appropriations or the amount of new defense contracts awarded may affect our ability to complete contracts, obtain new work and grow our business. Congress and such foreign governments do not always enact spending bills by the beginning of the new fiscal year. Such delays leave the affected agencies under-funded which delays their ability to contract. Future delays and uncertainties in funding could impose additional business risks on us.. In addition, the DoD has an increased emphasis on awarding contracts to small businesses; awarding contracts for defense-related services to the lowest-priced, technically acceptable offeror; and awarding shorter duration contracts, each of which has the potential to reduce the amount of revenue we could otherwise earn from such contracts. Shorter duration contracts lower our backlog numbers and increase the risk associated with re-competing for a contract, as we would need to do so more often. In addition, as we may need to expend capital resources at higher levels upon the award of a new contract, the shorter the duration of the contract, the less time we have to recoup such expenditures and turn a profit under such contract.. 18. Table of Contents. Failure to raise the national debt limit may cause the U.S. government to be unable to pay funds due to us.. Congress and the executive branch may reach an impasse on increasing the national debt limit which would restrict the U.S. government's ability to pay contractors for prior work. A failure to receive such payments for an extended period of time could result in substantial layoffs of our employees, drawdowns of our credit lines and our inability to pay debts when due, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.. A deadlock in the U.S. Congress over budgets and spending could cause another partial shutdown of the U.S. government or sequestration, which could result in a termination or suspension of some or all of our contracts with the U.S. government.. If Congress does not agree on a budget or continuing resolution, it may result in a partial shutdown of the U.S. government or sequestration and cause the termination or suspension of our contracts with the U.S. government or automatic cuts to the U.S. defense budget, which could impact some or all of our contracts. Under such circumstances, we could be required to furlough affected employees for an indefinite time, terminate or suspend subcontracts, or incur contract wind-down costs. It is uncertain if we would be compensated or reimbursed for any loss of revenue during such periods. If we were not compensated or reimbursed, it could result in significant adverse effects on our revenues, operating costs and cash flows.. Our contracts with government agencies may be terminated or modified prior to completion, which could adversely affect our business.. Government contracts typically contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government agencies rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts, including providing the government agency with the ability to unilaterally:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tterminate our existing contracts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduce the value of our existing contracts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmodify some of the terms and conditions in our existing contracts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuspend or permanently prohibit us from doing business with the government or with any specific government agency;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontrol and potentially prohibit the export of our products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcancel or delay existing multi-year contracts and related orders if the necessary funds for contract performance for any subsequent year are not appropriated;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdecline to exercise an option to extend an existing multi-year contract; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tclaim rights in technologies and systems invented, developed or produced by us.. Most U.S. government agencies and some other agencies with which we contract can terminate their contracts with us for convenience, and in that event we generally may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. If an agency terminates a contract with us for default, we may be denied any recovery and may be liable for excess costs incurred by the agency in procuring undelivered items from an alternative source. We may receive show-cause or cure notices under contracts that, if not addressed to the agency's satisfaction, could give the agency the right to terminate those contracts for default or to cease procuring our services under those contracts.. In the event that any of our contracts were to be terminated or adversely modified, there may be significant adverse effects on our revenues, operating costs and income that would not be recoverable.. 19. Table of Contents. We have made assumptions concerning behavior by public transit authorities which may not hold true over time.. In our transportation business we have made certain assumptions that support the growth of the business. For example, we have assumed that governments will continue to charge passengers for using public transit. We have also assumed that transit agencies will continue to outsource operations and services. Should these assumptions not hold true, our transportation business could experience a material loss of business.. The use of ride sharing services and the development of autonomous vehicles could erode the demand for traditional public transit.. Ride sharing services are creating options for public transit patrons which may be leading to the decline of ridership in some markets.  The development and acceptance of autonomous vehicles could also lead to a decline in ridership for public transit systems. If these trends continue or expand, public transit agencies may decide to defer or reduce plans to upgrade their fare collection systems and our prospects for growth in our transportation business could diminish.. Changes in future business or other market conditions could cause business investments and/or recorded goodwill or other long-term assets to become impaired, resulting in substantial losses and write-downs that would reduce our results of operations.. As part of our strategy, we will, from time to time, acquire a minority or majority interest in a business. These investments are made upon careful analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective. These procedures often involve certain assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition price. After acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise which adversely affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates.. We evaluate our recorded goodwill balances for potential impairment annually as of July 1, or when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including recorded goodwill. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we recognized a goodwill impairment in our CGD Services segment of $50.9 million. This goodwill impairment, and any impairment that might be necessary in the future, is measured by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value, and any impairment determined is recorded in the current period.. No goodwill impairment has been recognized subsequent to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Any future impairment could result in substantial losses and write-downs that would reduce our results of operations. For more information on the accounting policies we have in place for impairment of goodwill, see our discussion under \"Valuation of Goodwill\" in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.. Failure to retain existing contracts or win new contracts under competitive bidding processes may adversely affect our revenue.. We obtain most of our contracts through a competitive bidding process, and substantially all of the business that we expect to seek in the foreseeable future likely will be subject to a competitive bidding process. Competitive bidding presents a number of risks, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe need to compete against companies or teams of companies with more financial and marketing resources and more experience in bidding on and performing major contracts than we have;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe need to compete against companies or teams of companies that may be long-term, entrenched incumbents for a particular contract for which we are competing and that have, as a result, greater domain expertise and better customer relations;. 20. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe need to compete to retain existing contracts that have in the past been awarded to us on a sole-source basis or as to which we have been incumbent for a long time;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe U.S. government's increased emphasis on awarding contracts to small businesses could preclude us from bidding on certain work or reduce the scope of work we can bid as a prime contractor and limit the amount of revenue we could otherwise earn as a prime contractor for such contracts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe award of contracts on a \"lowest-priced technically acceptable\" basis which may lower the profit we may generate under a contract awarded using this evaluation method or prevent us from submitting a bid for such work due to us deeming such work to be unprofitable;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe reduction of margins achievable under any contracts awarded to us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe expense and delay that may arise if our competitors protest or otherwise challenge new contract awards;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe need to bid on some programs in advance of the completion of their design, which may result in higher R&D expenditures, unforeseen technological difficulties, or increased costs which lower our profitability;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe substantial cost and managerial time and effort, including design, development and marketing activities, necessary to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe need to develop, introduce and implement new and enhanced solutions to our customers' needs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe need to locate and contract with teaming partners and subcontractors; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe need to accurately estimate the resources and cost structure that will be required to perform any fixed-price contract that we are awarded.. We may not be afforded the opportunity in the future to bid on contracts that are held by other companies and are scheduled to expire if the agency decides to extend the existing contract. If we are unable to win particular contracts that are awarded through the competitive bidding process, we may not be able to operate in the market for services that are provided under those contracts for a number of years. If we win a contract, and upon expiration the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process and there can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract.. As a result of the complexity and scheduling of contracting with government agencies, we occasionally incur costs before receiving contractual funding by the government agency. In some circumstances, we may not be able to recover these costs in whole or in part under subsequent contractual actions.. In addition, the customers currently serviced by our CTS segment are finite in number. The loss of any one of these customers, or the failure to win replacement awards upon expiration of contracts with such customers could adversely impact us.. If we are unable to consistently retain existing contracts or win new contract awards, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.. Many of our U.S. government customers spend their procurement budgets through multiple-award or ID/IQ contracts, under which we are required to compete among the awardees for post-award orders. Failure to win post-award orders could affect our ability to increase our sales.. The U.S. government can select multiple winners under multiple-award contracts, federal supply schedules and other agency-specific ID/IQ contracts, as well as award subsequent purchase orders among such multiple winners. This means that there is no guarantee that these ID/IQ, multiple-award contracts will result in the actual orders equal to the ceiling. 21. Table of Contents. value under the contract, or result in any actual orders. We are only eligible to compete for work (purchase orders and delivery orders) as an awardee pursuant to government-wide acquisition contracts already awarded to us. Our failure to compete effectively in this procurement environment could reduce our sales, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. The U.S. government's emphasis on awarding contracts to small businesses could preclude us from acting as a prime contractor and increase the number of contracts we receive as a subcontractor to small businesses, which could decrease the amount of our revenues from such contracts. Some of these small businesses may not be financially sound, which could adversely affect our business.. There is emphasis by the U.S. government on awarding contracts to small businesses, which may preclude companies the size of ours from obtaining certain work, other than as a subcontractor to these small businesses for no more than 49% of the total contract price. There are inherent risks in contracting with small companies that may not have the capability or financial resources to perform these contracts or administer them correctly. If a small business with which we have a subcontract fails to perform, fails to bill the government properly or fails financially, we may have difficulty receiving timely payments or may incur bad debt write-offs if the small business is unable or unwilling to pay us for work we perform. In addition, being a subcontractor may limit the amount of revenue we could otherwise earn as a prime contractor for such contracts. When we only act as a subcontractor, we may only receive up to 49% of the value of the contract award, and such percentage may be less should the small business partner or partners be able to service a larger piece of the award. Failure to maintain good relationships with small business partners operating in our industries could preclude us from winning work as a subcontractor as part of a large contracting consortium. This could result in significant adverse effects on our revenues, operating costs and cash flows.. Government audits of our contracts could result in a material charge to our earnings, have a negative effect on our cash position following an audit adjustment or adversely affect our ability to conduct future business.. U.S. government agencies, including the DoD and others, routinely audit and review a contractor's performance on government contracts, indirect rates and pricing practices, and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards. Based on the results of such audits, the auditing agency is authorized to adjust our unit prices if the auditing agency does not find them to be \"fair and reasonable.\" The auditing agency is also authorized to require us to refund any excess proceeds we received on a particular item over its final adjusted unit price.. The DoD, in particular, also reviews the adequacy of, and compliance with, our internal control systems and policies, including our purchasing, accounting, financial capability, pricing, labor pool, overhead rate and management information systems. Our failure to obtain an \"adequate\" determination of our various accounting and management internal control systems from the responsible U.S. government agency could significantly and adversely affect our business, including our ability to bid on new contracts and our competitive position in the bidding process. Failure to comply with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards could also result in the U.S. government imposing penalties and sanctions against us, including suspension of payments and increased government scrutiny that could delay or adversely affect our ability to invoice and receive timely payment on contracts or perform contracts, or could result in suspension or debarment from competing for contracts with the U.S. government. In addition, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us, whether or not true.. In addition, transit authorities have the right to audit our work under their respective contracts. If, as the result of an adverse audit finding, we were suspended or prohibited from contracting with the U.S. government, any significant government agency or a transit authority terminated its contract with us, or our reputation or relationship with such agencies and authorities was impaired or they otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business done with us, it would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. 22. Table of Contents. Our international business exposes us to additional risks, including exchange rate fluctuations, foreign tax and legal regulations and political or economic instability that could harm our operating results.. Our international operations subject us to risks associated with operating in and selling products or services in foreign countries, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in foreign laws that adversely affect our ability to sell our products or services or our ability to repatriate profits to the United States;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreases or impositions of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures to us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreases in investment and other restrictions or requirements by foreign governments in order to operate in the territory or own the subsidiary;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcosts of compliance with local laws, including labor laws, privacy laws, and import/export regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompliance with applicable U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws, anti-trust/competition laws, anti-Boycott Israel laws, anti-money laundering laws and sanctions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texport control regulations and policies which govern our ability to supply foreign customers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunfamiliar and unknown business practices and customs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompliance with domestic and foreign government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of contract funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation or offset requirements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe complexity and necessity of using foreign representatives and consultants or being prohibited from such use;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe difficulty of ensuring that our foreign representatives, consultants and partners comply with applicable U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and anti-trust/competition laws;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe need to form joint ventures or other special purpose companies with local, in-country partners to pursue projects as a prime contractor;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe uncertainty of the ability of foreign customers to finance purchases;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timposition of tariffs or embargoes, export controls and other trade restrictions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotentially being prohibited from bidding for international work due to perceived conflicts or national security concerns resulting from the significant amount of work we do for the U.S. government and its agencies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise in various countries; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teconomic and geopolitical developments and conditions, including ongoing instability in global economies and financial markets, international hostilities, acts of terrorism and governmental reactions, inflation, trade relationships and military and political alliances.. Our foreign subsidiaries generally enter into contracts and make purchase commitments that are denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, we are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates, which could have a significant impact on our results of operations. We have no control over the factors that generally affect this risk, such as economic, financial and. 23. Table of Contents. political events and the supply of and demand for applicable currencies. While we use foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge significant contract sales and purchase commitments that are denominated in foreign currencies, our hedging strategy may not prevent us from incurring losses due to exchange fluctuations.. The results of the United Kingdom's referendum on withdrawal from the European Union (EU) may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.. In June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the EU in a national referendum. The referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the United Kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process. Nevertheless, the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU, and has given rise to calls for the governments of other EU member states to consider withdrawal.. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and could significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Asset valuations, currency exchange rates and credit ratings may be especially subject to increased market volatility. Lack of clarity about future United Kingdom laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which EU laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal, could depress economic activity, restrict our access to capital or adversely affect our contracts or relationships with customers in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in the European economic area, including, for example, our contracts with Transport for London, which accounted for $147.3 million, $156.3 million and $183.2 million of our sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. If the United Kingdom and the EU are unable to negotiate acceptable withdrawal terms or if other EU member states pursue withdrawal, barrier-free access between the United Kingdom and other EU member states or among the European economic area overall could be diminished or eliminated. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We may not be able to receive the necessary licenses required for us to sell our export-controlled products and services overseas. In addition, the loss of our registration as either an exporter or a broker under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) or the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. U.S. government agencies, primarily the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls within the State Department and the Bureau of Industry Security within the U.S. Department of Commerce, must license shipments of certain export-controlled products that we export. These licenses are required due to both the products we export and to the foreign customers we service. If we do not receive a license for an export-controlled product, we cannot ship that product. We cannot be sure of our ability to gain any licenses required to export our products, and failure to receive a required license would eliminate our ability to make that sale. A delay in obtaining the necessary licenses to sell our export-controlled products abroad could result in delayed deliveries and delayed recognition of revenue, which could cause us reputational damage and could result in a customer's decision not to do business with us in the future. We may also be subject to inquiries by such U.S. government agencies relating to issues involving the export-controlled products and services we export and failure to satisfactorily resolve such inquiries would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. In addition to obtaining a license for certain of our exports outside of the United States, we are also required to maintain a standing registry under the ITAR and the EAR as an exporter. We operate as an exporter when we ship certain products to our customers outside the United States. If we were to lose our registration as an exporter under the ITAR or the EAR, we would not be able to sell export-controlled products abroad, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. 24. Table of Contents. The loss of required licenses from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives could limit our ability to perform on contracts requiring the use of controlled firearms.. In our training business we use certain firearms which are regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. If we fail to properly manage the firearms pursuant to the regulations, we could face fines and the possible loss of the licenses. The loss of the licenses could result in our inability to perform on certain contracts, which would have an adverse business, reputational and financial impact.. Our operating margins may decline under our fixed-price contracts if we fail to accurately estimate the time and resources necessary to satisfy our obligations.. Approximately 83% of our revenues in fiscal year 2017 were from fixed-price contracts under which we bear the risk of cost overruns. Our profits are adversely affected if our costs under these contracts exceed the assumptions we used in bidding for the contract. We may therefore need to absorb any increases in our supply costs and may not be able to pass such costs increases along to our customers. Sometimes we are required to fix the price for a contract before the project specifications are finalized, which increases the risk that we will incorrectly price these contracts. The complexity of many of our engagements makes accurately estimating the time and resources required more difficult.. We may not receive the full amounts estimated under the contracts in our total backlog, which could reduce our sales in future periods below the levels anticipated and which makes backlog an uncertain indicator of future operating results.. As of September 30, 2017, our total backlog was approximately $3.1 billion. Orders may be cancelled and scope adjustments may occur, and we may not realize the full amounts of sales that we may anticipate in our backlog numbers. There can be no assurance that the projects underlying the contracts and purchase orders will be placed or completed or that amounts included in our backlog ultimately will be billed and collected. Additionally, the timing of receipt of sales, if any, on contracts included in our backlog could change. The failure to realize amounts reflected in our backlog could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in future periods.. We may be liable for civil or criminal penalties under a variety of complex laws and regulations, and changes in governmental regulations could adversely affect our business and financial condition.. Our businesses must comply with and are affected by various U.S. government and foreign regulations that impact our operating costs, profit margins and our internal organization and operation of our businesses. These regulations affect how we do business and, in some instances, impose added costs. Any changes in applicable laws could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Any material failure to comply with applicable laws could result in contract termination, price or fee reductions or suspension or debarment from contracting. The more significant regulations include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and all department and agency supplements, which comprehensively regulate the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Truth in Negotiations Act and implementing regulations, which require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ITAR, which control the export of items on the U.S. Munitions Control List administered by the U.S. Department of State;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Export Administration Regulations which control commercial, dual-use and select defense related articles;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regulations that control the manufacture, possession and sale of firearms and explosive devices and materials;. 25. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlaws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulations of most state and regional agencies and foreign governments similar to those described above;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Sherman Act and Clayton Act, which proscribe unlawful, anti-competitive conduct and business practices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thealthcare reform laws and regulations, including those enacted under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Fair Labor Standards Act and similar state wage and hour laws;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttax laws and regulations in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe EU's General Data Protection Regulation and any attendant European country legislation:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe civil False Claims Act, which provides for substantial civil penalties for violations, including for submission of a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government for payment or approval;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Procurement Integrity Act, which requires evaluation of ethical conflicts surrounding procurement activity and establishing certain employment restrictions for individuals who participate in the procurement process; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Small Business Act and the Small Business Administration, size status regulations, which regulate eligibility for performance of government contracts which are set aside for, or a preference is given in the evaluation process if awarded to, specific types of contractors such as small businesses and minority-owned businesses.. Many of our U.S. government contracts contain organizational conflicts of interest clauses that may limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts. Organizational conflicts of interest arise when we engage in activities that provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. A conflict of interest issue that precludes our competition for or performance on a significant program or contract could harm our prospects and negative publicity about a conflict of interest issue could damage our reputation.. In addition, the U.S. and foreign governments may revise existing contract rules and regulations or adopt new contract rules and regulations at any time and may also face restrictions or pressure regarding the type and amount of services it may obtain from private contractors. For instance, Congressional legislation and initiatives dealing with procurement reform and shifts in the buying practices of U.S. government agencies resulting from those proposals could have adverse effects on government contractors, including us. Any of these changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or renew contracts under which we currently perform when those contracts are eligible for re-competition. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Our failure to identify, attract and retain qualified technical and management personnel could adversely affect our existing businesses, financial condition and results of operations.. We may not be able to identify, attract or retain qualified technical personnel, including engineers, computer programmers and personnel with security clearances required for classified work, or management personnel to supervise such activities that are necessary for maintaining and growing our existing businesses, which could adversely affect our. 26. Table of Contents. financial condition and results of operations. The technically complex nature of our operations results in difficulties finding qualified staff. In our defense businesses especially, experienced personnel possessing required security clearances are finite in number. A number of our employees maintain a top secret clearance level. Obtaining and maintaining security clearances for employees involves a lengthy process, and it is difficult to identify, recruit and retain employees who already hold security clearances. If our cleared employees lose or are unable to timely obtain security clearances or we lose a facility clearance, our U.S. government customers may terminate the contract or decide not to renew it upon its expiration. As a result, to the extent we cannot obtain or maintain the required security clearances for a particular contract, or we fail to obtain them on a timely basis, we may not generate the sales anticipated from the contract, which could harm our operating results. To the extent we are not able to obtain facility security clearances or engage employees with the required security clearances for a particular contract, we will be unable to perform that contract and we may not be able to compete for or win new awards for similar work.. Our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.. We face cyber threats, threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, including senior executives, and terrorist acts, as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with information technology failures, damaging weather or other acts of nature, and pandemics or other public health crises, which may adversely affect our business.. We routinely experience cyber security threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our company sensitive information, as do our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and joint venture partners. We may experience similar security threats at customer sites that we operate and manage as a contractual requirement.. Prior cyber attacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results, and we believe our threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures are robust. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.. Although we work cooperatively with our customers and our suppliers, subcontractors, and joint venture partners to seek to minimize the impacts of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions, in addition to our internal processes, procedures and systems, we must also rely on the safeguards put in place by those entities.. The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully mitigated by insurance or other means. Occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our internal operations, the services we provide to customers, loss of competitive advantages derived from our R&D efforts, early obsolescence of our products and services, our future financial results, our reputation or our stock price. The occurrence of any of these events could also result in civil and/or criminal liabilities.. We may incur significant costs in protecting our intellectual property which could adversely affect our profit margins. Our inability to obtain, maintain and enforce our patents and other proprietary rights could adversely affect our businesses' prospects and competitive positions.. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and inventions through patents and other proprietary-right protection, and also rely on trademark laws to protect our brand. However, we may fail to obtain the intellectual property rights necessary to provide us with a competitive advantage, and any of our owned or licensed intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated.. We may also fail to apply for or obtain intellectual property protection in important foreign countries, and the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to obtain or maintain these protections, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our technology and inventions, which could adversely affect our business.. The DoD has become more aggressive in seeking rights in all technical data, computer software, and computer software documentation that we may deliver under U.S. government contracts. Those rights include the ability of the government to provide that technical data, computer software, and computer software documentation to our competitors which may. 27. Table of Contents. result in \"leveling the playing field\" for competitors and reducing our incumbency advantage during re-procurements for those goods or services.. We may incur significant expense in obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights. We may fail to take the actions necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and even if we attempt to enforce such rights we may ultimately be unsuccessful, and such efforts may result in our intellectual property rights being challenged, limited in scope, or declared invalid or unenforceable. Also, some aspects of our business and services may rely on technologies and software developed by or licensed from third parties, and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with such third parties or enter into similar relationships in the future on reasonable terms or at all.. We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to remain competitive. We have taken measures to protect our trade secrets and know-how, including seeking to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and advisors, but the measures we have taken may not be sufficient. For example, confidentiality agreements may not provide adequate protection or may be breached. We generally control and limit access to our product documentation and other proprietary information, but other parties may independently develop our know-how or otherwise obtain access to our technology, which could adversely affect our businesses' prospects and competitive position.. Assertions by third parties that we violate their intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Third parties may claim that we, our customers, licensees or parties indemnified by us are infringing upon or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights. Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by other parties. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies like ours.. Any claims that we violate a third party's intellectual property rights can be time consuming and costly to defend and distract management's attention and resources, even if the claims are without merit. Such claims may also require us to redesign affected products and services, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or providing the affected products and services. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may not have sufficient financial resources or otherwise be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology on favorable terms or cannot or do not substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.. We compete primarily for government contracts against many companies that are larger, better capitalized and better known than us. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business and prospects will be adversely affected.. Our businesses operate in highly competitive markets. Many of our competitors are larger, better financed and better known companies who may compete more effectively than we can. In order to remain competitive, we must keep our capabilities technically advanced and compete on price and on value added to our customers. Our ability to compete may be adversely affected by limits on our capital resources and our ability to invest in maintaining and expanding our market share. Consolidation in the industries in which we operate and government budget cuts have led to pressure being placed on the margins we may earn on any contracts we win. In addition, should the transportation market move towards requiring contractors to provide up-front financing for contracts they are awarded (for example, our contract for the Chicago Open Standards Fare System), we may need to compete more heavily on the basis of our financial strength, which may limit the contracts we can service at any one time.. The terms of our financing arrangements may restrict our financial and operational flexibility, including our ability to invest in new business opportunities.. In March 2013, we entered into a note purchase and private shelf agreement pursuant to which we issued $100.0 million of senior unsecured notes, bearing interest at a rate of 3.35% and maturing on March 12, 2025. In addition, pursuant to. 28. Table of Contents. the agreement, on July 17, 2015, we issued an additional $25.0 million of senior unsecured notes, bearing interest at a rate of 3.70% and maturing on March 12, 2025. Interest payments on the notes issued in 2013 and 2015 are due semi-annually and principal payments are due from 2021 through 2025. The agreement pertaining to the aforementioned notes also contained a provision that the coupon rate would increase by a further 0.50% should the company's leverage ratio exceed a certain level. On February 2, 2016 we revised the note purchase agreement and we issued an additional $75.0 million of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at 3.93% and maturing on March 12, 2026. Interest payments on these notes are due semi-annually and principal payments are due from 2020 through 2026. At the time of the issuance of this last series of notes, certain terms and conditions of the note purchase and private shelf agreement were revised in coordination with the revision and expansion of the revolving credit agreement as discussed below in order to increase our leverage capacity.. We have a committed revolving credit agreement with a group of financial institutions in the amount of $400.0 million which expires in August 2021 (Revolving Credit Agreement). At September 30, 2017, the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement was 3.24%. As of September 30, 2017, there were borrowings totaling $55.0 million under this agreement and there were letters of credit outstanding totaling $81.3 million, which reduce the available line of credit to $263.7 million.. Our revolving credit agreement and note purchase and private shelf agreement each contain a number of customary covenants, including requirements for us to maintain certain interest coverage and leverage ratios and restrictions on our and certain of our subsidiaries' abilities to, among other things, incur additional debt, create liens, consolidate or merge with any other entity, or transfer or sell substantially all of their assets, in each case subject to certain exceptions and limitations. The occurrence of any event of default under these agreements may result in all of the indebtedness then outstanding becoming immediately due and payable, or the increase of the coupon rate for such indebtedness. For example, at March 31, 2017 we did not maintain the required leverage ratio. Therefore in May 2017 certain terms and conditions of the Revolving Credit Agreement and note purchase and private shelf agreement were further revised to allow us to maintain a higher level of leverage as of March 31, 2017 and for the remainder of the 2017 fiscal year.  The revisions to the agreements do not impact the required leverage ratios in fiscal 2018 and subsequent years. This revision also contains a provision that the coupon rate may increase on all of the term notes discussed above by up to 0.75% should our leverage ratio exceed certain levels.. Our development contracts may be difficult for us to comply with and may expose us to third-party claims for damages.. We are often party to government and commercial contracts involving the development of new products and systems. These contracts typically contain strict performance obligations and project milestones. We cannot assure you we will comply with these performance obligations or meet these project milestones in the future. If we are unable to comply with these performance obligations or meet these milestones, our customers may terminate these contracts and, under some circumstances, recover damages or other penalties from us. If other parties elect to terminate their contracts or seek damages from us, it could materially harm our business and negatively impact our stock price.. Our revenues could be less than expected if we are not able to deliver services or products as scheduled due to disruptions in supply.. Since our internal manufacturing capacity is limited, we use contract manufacturers. While we use care in selecting our manufacturers, we have less control over the reliability of supply, quality and price of products or components than if we manufactured them. In some cases, we obtain products from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Consequently, we risk disruptions in our supply of key products and components if our suppliers fail or are unable to perform because of shortages in raw materials, operational problems, strikes, natural disasters, financial condition or other factors. We may have disputes with our vendors arising from, among other things, the quality of products and services or customer concerns about the vendor. If any of our vendors fail to timely meet their contractual obligations or have regulatory compliance or other problems, our ability to fulfill our obligations may be jeopardized. Economic downturns can adversely affect a vendor's ability to manufacture or deliver products. Further, vendors may also be enjoined from manufacturing and distributing products to us as a result of litigation filed by third parties, including intellectual property litigation. If we were to experience difficulty in obtaining certain products, there could be an. 29. Table of Contents. adverse effect on our results of operations and on our customer relationships and our reputation. Additionally, our key vendors could also increase pricing of their products, which could negatively affect our ability to win contracts by offering competitive prices.. Any material supply disruptions could adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations under our contracts and could result in cancellation of contracts or purchase orders, penalties, delays in realizing revenues, payment delays, as well as adversely affect our ongoing product cost structure.. Failure to perform by our subcontractors could materially and adversely affect our contract performance and our ability to obtain future business.. Our performance of contracts often involves subcontractors, upon which we rely to complete delivery of products or services to our customers. We may have disputes with subcontractors. A failure by a subcontractor to satisfactorily deliver products or services can adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor. Any subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in the customer terminating our contract for default, which could expose us to liability for excess costs of reprocurement by the customer and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for other contracts.. Our future success will depend on our ability to develop new products, systems and services that achieve market acceptance in our current and future markets.. Both our commercial and government businesses are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, our performance depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tidentify emerging technological trends in our current and target markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelop and maintain competitive products, systems and services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenhance our offerings by adding technological innovations that differentiate our products, systems and services from those of our competitors; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelop, manufacture and bring to market cost-effective offerings quickly.. We believe that, in order to remain competitive in the future, we will need to continue to develop new products, systems and services, and in some cases transition to a product-oriented approach as opposed to our historical, project oriented approach, all of which will require the investment of significant financial resources. The need to make these expenditures could divert our attention and resources from other projects, and we cannot be sure that these expenditures ultimately will lead to the timely development of new products, systems or services. In recent years, we have spent an amount equal to approximately 1% to 4% of our annual sales on internal R&D efforts. There can be no assurances that this percentage will not increase should we require increased innovations to successfully compete in the markets we serve. We may also experience delays in completing development and introducing certain new products, systems or services in the future due to their design complexity. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or redirect resources from other projects. In addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for our products, systems or services will develop as we currently anticipate, which could significantly reduce our revenue and harm our business. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing products, systems or services that gain market acceptance in advance of ours, or that cause our existing products, systems or services to become non-competitive or obsolete, which could adversely affect our results of operations.. If we deliver products or systems with defects, our reputation will be harmed, revenue from, and market acceptance of, our products and systems will decrease and we could expend significant capital and resources as a result of such defects.. Our products and systems are complex and frequently operate in high-performance, challenging environments. Notwithstanding our internal quality specifications, our products and systems have sometimes contained errors, defects. 30. Table of Contents. and bugs when introduced. If we deliver products or systems with errors, defects or bugs, our reputation and the market acceptance and sales of our products and systems would be harmed. Further, if our products or systems contain errors, defects or bugs, we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate such problems and incur significant costs for product recalls and inventory write-offs. Defects could also lead to product liability lawsuits against us or against our customers, and could also damage our reputation. We have agreed to indemnify our customers in some circumstances against liability arising from defects in our products and systems. In the event of a successful product liability claim, we could be obligated to pay damages significantly in excess of our product liability insurance limits.. We face certain significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be covered adequately by insurance or indemnity.. We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. A significant portion of our business relates to designing, developing, manufacturing, operating and maintaining advanced defense and transportation systems and products. New technologies associated with these systems and products may be untested or unproven. In addition, certain activities in connection with which our training systems are used or our services are provided are inherently dangerous.. While in some circumstances we may receive indemnification from U.S. and foreign governments, and we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance or indemnity may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident or incident. It also is not possible for us to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. Substantial claims resulting from an incident in excess of the indemnification we receive and our insurance coverage would harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, any accident or incident for which we are liable, even if fully insured, could negatively affect our standing with our customers and the public, thereby making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, and could significantly impact the cost and availability of adequate insurance in the future.. We may acquire other companies, which could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive to our business.. Part of our strategy involves the acquisition of other companies. For example, from fiscal 2015 through 2017, we acquired DTECH, GATR, TeraLogics, and Vocality in connection with our strategic efforts to build and expand our command, control, communication, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) business.. We may not be able to integrate acquired companies successfully without substantial expense, delay or operational or financial problems. Such expenses, delays or operational or financial problems may include the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may need to divert management resources to integration, which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other more profitable activities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tintegration may be difficult as a result of the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations, integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may not be able to eliminate redundant costs anticipated at the time we select acquisition candidates; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tone or more of our acquisition candidates may have unexpected liabilities, fraud risk, or adverse operating issues that we fail to discover through our due diligence procedures prior to the acquisition.. As a result, the integration of acquired businesses may be costly and may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.. Our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Employee misconduct could include intentionally failing to comply with U.S. government procurement regulations, engaging in unauthorized activities, attempting to. 31. Table of Contents. obtain reimbursement for improper expenses, or submitting falsified time records, which could result in legal proceedings against us, lost contracts or reduced revenues.. Employee misconduct could also involve improper use of our customers' sensitive or classified information, which could result in regulatory sanctions against us and serious harm to our reputation. Misconduct could also involve making payments to government officials or third parties that would expose us to being in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Anti-Bribery Act or similar laws in other countries.. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, alleged or actual employee misconduct could result in investigations or prosecutions of employees engaged in the subject activities, which could result in unanticipated consequences or expenses and management distraction for us regardless of whether we are alleged to have any responsibility.. Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.. Our business operates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose taxes based on income and other criteria. Changes in domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower tax rates assessed, changes in the taxability of certain revenues or activities, or changes in the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our tax expense and profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense.. Our results of operations have historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, which could adversely affect our stock price.. Our results of operations are affected by factors such as the unpredictability of contract awards due to the long procurement process for most of our products and services, the potential fluctuation of governmental agency budgets, any timing differences between our work performed and costs incurred under a contract and our ability to recognize revenue and generate cash flow from such contract, the time it takes for the new markets we target to develop and for us to develop and provide products and services for those markets, competition and general economic conditions. Our contract type/product mix and unit volume, our ability to keep expenses within budget and our pricing affect our operating margins. Significant growth in costs to complete our contracts may adversely affect our results of operations in future periods and cause our financial results to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis. In addition, certain contracts in our CTS segment are structured such that we incur significant expenses during the design and build phases of the contract that are not offset by revenue recognized or cash flows generated under the contract until we deliver a product or perform operational or maintenance services during the latter phases of the contract. Consequently, we do not believe that comparison of our results of operations from period to period is necessarily meaningful or predictive of our likely future results of operations. In future financial periods our operating results or cash flows may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors, which could cause the price of our stock to decline significantly.. The funding and costs associated with our pension plans may cause our earnings, cash flows, and shareholders' equity to fluctuate significantly from year to year.. Certain of our employees in the U.S. are covered by a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan and approximately one-half of our European employees are covered by a contributory defined benefit pension plan. The impact of these plans on our GAAP earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record for our pension plans may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions, including discount rates, inflation, salary growth, expected return on plan assets, retirement rates and mortality rates. Changes in these factors affect our plan funding, cash flows, earnings, and shareholders' equity.. We have taken certain actions to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plans on our financial results. For example, benefits under the U.S. plan were frozen as of December 31, 2006, so no new benefits have accrued after that date, and benefits under the European plan were frozen as of September 30, 2010, though the European plan is a final pay plan, which means that benefits will be adjusted for increases in the salaries of participants until their retirement or. 32. Table of Contents. departure from the company. U.S. and European employees hired subsequent to the dates of freezing of the respective plans are not eligible for participation in the defined benefit plans. For more information on how these factors could impact earnings, cash flows and shareholders' equity, see \"Pension costs\" in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.. We are subject to various investigations, claims and litigation that could ultimately be resolved against us.. The size, nature and complexity of our business make us susceptible to investigations, claims, and litigation, particularly those involving governments. We are and may become subject to investigations, claims and administrative, civil or criminal litigation globally and across a broad array of matters, including, but not limited to, government contracts, false claims, products liability, fraud, environmental, intellectual property, tax, export/import, anti-corruption, labor, health and safety, employee benefits and plans, including plan administration, and improper payments. These matters could divert financial and management resources; result in fines, penalties, compensatory, treble or other damages or non-monetary relief; and otherwise disrupt our business. Government regulations also provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export privileges for a company or one or more of its components. Suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on our company because of our reliance on government contracts and export authorizations. An investigation, claim or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could also negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future. Investigations, claims or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.. Risks relating to our common stock. The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. An active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could depress the trading price of our common stock.. Volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares or at all. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, which include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour quarterly or annual earnings or those of our competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe public's reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who track our common stock or the stocks of our competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinaccuracy of our guidance regarding future operating results;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of laws or regulations applicable to our business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in general conditions in the domestic and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlitigation involving our company or investigations or audits by regulators into the operations of our company or our competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstrategic action by our competitors; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and significant shareholders.. 33. Table of Contents. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. If litigation is instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources.. Our Chairman of the Board of Directors beneficially owns a large percentage of our common stock and as a result can exert significant influence over us.. At October 6, 2017, Walter C. Zable, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Karen F. Cox, Mr. Zable's sister, beneficially owned an aggregate of 3,005,776 shares, or approximately 11.1%, of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, Mr. Zable and Ms. Cox may be able to substantially influence all matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. Circumstances may arise in which the interests of these shareholders could conflict with the interests of our other shareholders. These shareholders could delay or prevent a change in control of Cubic even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our other shareholders.. Your percentage ownership in us may be diluted by future issuances of capital stock, which could reduce your influence over matters on which shareholders vote.. Our board of directors has the authority, without action or vote of our shareholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon the exercise of options and the vesting of restricted stock units, shares that may be issued in the future under our 2015 Incentive Award Plan or shares of our authorized but unissued preferred stock. Issuances of common stock or preferred voting stock could reduce your influence over matters on which our shareholders vote and, in the case of issuances of preferred stock, likely could result in your interest in us being subject to the prior rights of holders of that preferred stock.. Provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of Cubic.. Provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that shareholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempt by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprior to the date of the transaction, an affirmative vote of the holders of at least 662/3% of our outstanding common stock is required for the approval, adoption or authorization of a business combination;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta prohibition on shareholder action through written consent;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta requirement that special meetings of shareholders be called only by our board of directors or by a committee of our board of directors that has been duly designated to do so by our board of directors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe authority of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as our board of directors may determine; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta requirement for the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 662/3% of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of our voting stock to amend our amended and restated bylaws, or to amend specific provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.. In addition, Delaware law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder, generally a person who, together with its affiliates, owns or within the last three years has. 34. Table of Contents. owned 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly, Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company.. If we are unable to pay semiannual dividends at the targeted level, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.. We have consistently paid cash dividends to our shareholders since 1971, and, in fiscal 2017, we paid $7.3 million of cash dividends to our shareholders.. The dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flows. Our ability to continue to pay semiannual dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our board of directors may, at its discretion, decrease the targeted semiannual dividend amount or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may adversely affect our reputation and investor confidence in us, and negatively impact our stock price.. If securities or industry analysts cease to publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.. The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION. This report, including the documents incorporated by reference herein, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are subject to the safe harbor created by such Act. Any statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, future events or our future financial and/or operating performance, including those concerning new programs and growth in the markets in which we do business, increases in demand for our products and for fully integrated systems, retention of existing contracts and receipt of new contracts, the development of new products, systems and services, expansion of our automated payment and fare collection systems and services, maintenance of long-term relationships with our existing customers, expansion of our service offerings and customer base for services, maintenance of a diversified business mix, expansion of our international footprint, strategic acquisitions, U.S. and foreign government funding, supplies of raw materials and purchased parts, cash needs, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, and the trends that may affect us or the industries in which we operate, are not historical and may be forward-looking. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"plan,\" \"project,\" \"continuing,\" \"ongoing,\" \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"intend,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" \"opportunity\" and similar words or phrases or the negatives of these words or phrases. These forward-looking statements involve risks, estimates, assumptions and uncertainties, including those discussed in \"Risk factors\" and elsewhere throughout this report and in the documents incorporated by reference herein, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these statements.. Such risks, estimates, assumptions and uncertainties include, among others: our dependence on U.S. and foreign government contracts; delays in approving U.S. and foreign government budgets and cuts in U.S. and foreign government defense expenditures; the ability of certain government agencies to unilaterally terminate or modify our contracts with them; the effects of potential sequestration on our contracts; our assumptions covering behavior by public transit authorities; our ability to successfully integrate new companies into our business and to properly assess the effects of such integration on our financial condition; the U.S. government's increased emphasis on awarding contracts to small. 35. Table of Contents. businesses, and our ability to retain existing contracts or win new contracts under competitive bidding processes; negative audits by the U.S. government; the effects of politics and economic conditions on negotiations and business dealings in the various countries in which we do business or intend to do business; competition and technology changes in the defense and transportation industries; the change in the way transit agencies pay for transit systems; our ability to accurately estimate the time and resources necessary to satisfy obligations under our contracts; the effect of adverse regulatory changes on our ability to sell products and services; our ability to identify, attract and retain qualified employees; our failure to properly implement our enterprise resource planning system; unforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems; business disruptions due to cyber security threats, physical threats, terrorist acts, acts of nature and public health crises; our involvement in litigation, including litigation related to patents, proprietary rights and employee misconduct; our reliance on subcontractors and on a limited number of third parties to manufacture and supply our products; our ability to comply with our development contracts and to successfully develop, introduce and sell new products, systems and services in current and future markets; defects in, or a lack of adequate coverage by insurance or indemnity for, our products and systems; changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws, exchange rates or our economic assumptions regarding our pension plans; unanticipated issues related to the restatement of our financial statements; our ability to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of new processes and procedures we have implemented to remediate the material weaknesses that existed in our internal control over financial reporting;  and other factors discussed elsewhere in this report.. Because the risks, estimates, assumptions and uncertainties referred to above could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. In addition, past financial and/or operating performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future performance and you should not use our historical performance to anticipate results or future period trends. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which factors will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements."
