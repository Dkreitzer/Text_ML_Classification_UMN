[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Asbestos - Related Liability - The Company has made, and will continue to make, substantial payments to resolve claims of persons alleging exposure to asbestos - containing products and may need to record additional charges in the future for estimated asbestos - related costs. These substantial payments have affected and may continue to affect the Company's cost of borrowing, its ability to pursue global or domestic acquisitions, its ability to reinvest in its operations, and its ability to pay dividends.. The Company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging bodily injury and death as a result of exposure to asbestos. From 1948 to 1958, one of the Company's former business units commercially produced and sold approximately $40 million of a high - temperature, calcium - silicate based pipe and block insulation material containing asbestos. The Company exited the insulation business in April 1958. The typical asbestos personal injury lawsuit alleges various theories of liability, including negligence, gross negligence and strict liability and seeks compensatory, and in some cases, punitive damages, in various amounts (herein referred to as \"asbestos claims\").. Beginning with the initial liability of $975 million established in 1993, the Company has accrued a total of approximately $4.9 billion through 2017, before insurance recoveries, for its asbestos - related liability. The Company's ability to estimate its liability has been significantly affected by, among other factors, the volatility of asbestos - related litigation in the United States, the significant number of co - defendants that have filed for bankruptcy, the inherent uncertainty of future disease incidence and claiming patterns against the Company, the significant expansion of the defendants that are now sued in this litigation, and the continuing changes in the extent to which these defendants participate in the resolution of cases in which the Company is also a defendant.. For many years, the Company has conducted a comprehensive legal review of its asbestos-related liabilities and costs annually in connection with finalizing its annual results of operations. In May 2016, the Company revised its method for estimating its asbestos-related liabilities in connection with finalizing and reporting its restated results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2015. Its revised method uses estimated future claims filings provided by a third party consultant and the Company's legal judgment regarding estimated future indemnity and legal costs to develop a reasonable estimate of its total asbestos-related liabilities.  The revised methodology has led the Company to conclude that an asbestos liability of $582 million was required as of December 31, 2017.. The Company continues to believe that its ultimate asbestos-related liability cannot be estimated with certainty.  As part of its future annual comprehensive legal reviews, the Company will review its estimate of its total asbestos-related liability, unless significant changes in trends or new developments warrant an earlier review.  Such reviews may result in significant adjustments to the liability accrued at the time of the review.. The significant assumptions underlying the material components of the Company's accrual are:. a) \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsettlements will continue to be limited almost exclusively to claimants who were exposed to the Company's asbestos - containing insulation prior to its exit from that business in 1958;. b) \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tclaims will continue to be resolved primarily under the Company's administrative claims agreements or on terms comparable to those set forth in those agreements;. c) \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe incidence of serious asbestos - related disease cases and claiming patterns against the Company for such cases do not change materially;. d) \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Company is substantially able to defend itself successfully at trial and on appeal;. e) \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe number and timing of additional co - defendant bankruptcies do not change significantly the assets available to participate in the resolution of cases in which the Company is a defendant; and. 8. Table of Contents. f) \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tco - defendants with substantial resources and assets continue to participate significantly in the resolution of future asbestos lawsuits and claims.. The ultimate amount of distributions that may be required to fund the Company's asbestos - related payments cannot be estimated with certainty. Asbestos - related payments continue to be substantial and the continued use of significant amounts of cash for asbestos - related costs has affected and may continue to affect the Company's cost of borrowing, its ability to pursue global or domestic acquisitions, its ability to reinvest in its operations, and its ability to pay dividends.. Substantial Leverage - The Company's indebtedness could adversely affect the Company's financial health.. The Company has a significant amount of debt. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $5.3 billion of total debt outstanding.. The Company's indebtedness could result in the following consequences:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIncreased vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIncreased vulnerability to interest rate increases for the portion of the debt under the secured credit agreement;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRequire the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, development efforts and other general corporate purposes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tLimit flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the Company's business and the rigid packaging market;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPlace the Company at a competitive disadvantage relative to its competitors that have less debt; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tLimit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the documents governing indebtedness, among other things, the Company's ability to borrow additional funds. Ability to Service Debt - To service its indebtedness, the Company will require a significant amount of cash. The Company's ability to generate cash and refinance certain indebtedness depends on many factors beyond its control.. The Company's ability to make payments on and to refinance its indebtedness and to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development efforts and other general corporate purposes depends on its ability to generate cash in the future. The Company has no assurance that it will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available under the secured credit agreement, in an amount sufficient to enable the Company to pay its indebtedness, or to fund other liquidity needs. If short-term interest rates increase, the Company's debt service cost will increase because some of its debt is subject to short-term variable interest rates. At December 31, 2017, the Company's debt, including interest rate swaps, that is subject to variable interest rates represented approximately 41% of total debt.. The Company may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness on or before maturity. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow and is unable to refinance or extend outstanding borrowings on commercially reasonable terms or at all, it may have to take one or more of the following actions:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tReduce or delay capital expenditures planned for replacements, improvements and expansions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSell assets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRestructure debt; and/or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tObtain additional debt or equity financing.. 9. Table of Contents. The Company can provide no assurance that it could affect or implement any of these alternatives on satisfactory terms, if at all.. Debt Restrictions - The Company may not be able to finance future needs or adapt its business plans to changes because of restrictions placed on it by the secured credit agreement and the indentures and instruments governing other indebtedness.. The secured credit agreement, the indentures governing the senior debentures and notes, and certain of the agreements governing other indebtedness contain affirmative and negative covenants that limit the ability of the Company to take certain actions. For example, these indentures restrict, among other things, the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to borrow money, pay dividends on, or redeem or repurchase its stock, make investments, create liens, enter into certain transactions with affiliates and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies. These restrictions could adversely affect the Company's ability to operate its businesses and may limit its ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.. Failure to comply with these or other covenants and restrictions contained in the secured credit agreement, the indentures or agreements governing other indebtedness could result in a default under those agreements, and the debt under those agreements, together with accrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable. If a default occurs under the secured credit agreement, the Company could no longer request borrowings under the secured credit agreement, and the lenders could cause all of the outstanding debt obligations under such secured credit agreement to become due and payable, which would result in a default under a number of other outstanding debt securities and could lead to an acceleration of obligations related to these debt securities. A default under the secured credit agreement, indentures or agreements governing other indebtedness could also lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross - default provisions.. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates - The Company is subject to the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely impact the Company's financial results.. The Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. A significant portion of the Company's net sales, costs, assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, Brazilian real, Colombian peso, Mexican peso and Australian dollar. In its consolidated financial statements, the Company remeasures transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting entity (e.g. soda ash purchases) and translates local currency financial results into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, the reported revenues and earnings of the Company's international operations will be reduced because the local currencies will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. This could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. International Operations - The Company is subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries.. The Company operates manufacturing and other facilities throughout the world. Net sales from non - U.S. operations totaled approximately $4.8 billion, representing approximately 70% of the Company's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. As a result of its non - U.S. operations, the Company is subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPolitical, social and economic instability;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWar, civil disturbance or acts of terrorism;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tTaking of property by nationalization or expropriation without fair compensation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in governmental policies and regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDevaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFluctuations in currency exchange rates and other impacts resulting from the United Kingdom's. 10. Table of Contents. referendum on withdrawal from the European Union;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tImposition of limitations on conversions of foreign currencies into dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tImposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tHyperinflation in certain foreign countries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tImpositions or increase of investment and other restrictions or requirements by foreign governments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tLoss or non - renewal of treaties or other agreements with foreign tax authorities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in tax laws, or the interpretation thereof, affecting foreign tax credits or tax deductions relating to our non - U.S. earnings or operations; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tComplying with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or gaining an unfair business advantage and requires companies to maintain accurate books and records and internal controls.. The risks associated with operating in foreign countries may have a material adverse effect on operations.. Competition - The Company faces intense competition from other glass container producers, as well as from makers of alternative forms of packaging. Competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company's financial health.. The Company is subject to significant competition from other glass container producers, as well as from makers of alternative forms of packaging, such as aluminum cans and plastic containers. The Company also competes with manufacturers of non - rigid packaging alternatives, including flexible pouches and aseptic cartons, in serving the packaging needs of certain end - use markets, including juice customers. The Company competes with each rigid packaging competitor on the basis of price, quality, service and the marketing and functional attributes of the container. Advantages or disadvantages in any of these competitive factors may be sufficient to cause the customer to consider changing suppliers and/or using an alternative form of packaging. The adverse effects of consumer purchasing decisions may be more significant in periods of economic downturn and may lead to longer- term reductions in consumer spending on glass-job act packaged products.. Pressures from competitors and producers of alternative forms of packaging have resulted in excess capacity in certain countries in the past and have led to capacity adjustments and significant pricing pressures in the rigid packaging market.. Lower Demand Levels - Changes in consumer preferences may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial results.. Changes in consumer preferences for the food and beverages they consume can reduce demand for the Company's products. Because many of the Company's products are used to package consumer goods, the Company's sales and profitability could be negatively impacted by changes in consumer preferences for those products. Examples of changes in consumer preferences include, but are not limited to, lower sales of major domestic beer brands and shifts from beer to wine or spirits that results in the use of fewer glass containers. In periods of lower demand, the Company's sales and production levels may decrease causing a material adverse effect on the Company's profitability.. High Energy Costs - Higher energy costs worldwide and interrupted power supplies may have a material adverse effect on operations.. Electrical power, natural gas, and fuel oil are vital to the Company's operations as it relies on a continuous energy supply to conduct its business. Depending on the location and mix of energy sources, energy accounts for. 11. Table of Contents. 10% to 20% of total production costs. Substantial increases and volatility in energy costs could cause the Company to experience a significant increase in operating costs, which may have a material adverse effect on operations.. Global Economic Environment - The global credit, financial and economic environment could have a material adverse effect on operations and financial condition.. The global credit, financial and economic environment could have a material adverse effect on operations, including the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDownturns in the business or financial condition of any of the Company's customers or suppliers could result in a loss of revenues or a disruption in the supply of raw materials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tTightening of credit in financial markets could reduce the Company's ability, as well as the ability of the Company's customers and suppliers, to obtain future financing;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tVolatile market performance could affect the fair value of the Company's pension assets and liabilities, potentially requiring the Company to make significant additional contributions to its pension plans to maintain prescribed funding levels;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe deterioration of any of the lending parties under the Company's revolving credit facility or the creditworthiness of the counterparties to the Company's derivative transactions could result in such parties' failure to satisfy their obligations under their arrangements with the Company; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tA significant weakening of the Company's financial position or results of operations could result in noncompliance with the covenants under the Company's indebtedness.. Business Integration Risks - The Company may not be able to effectively integrate additional businesses it acquires in the future.. The Company may consider strategic transactions, including acquisitions that will complement, strengthen and enhance growth in its worldwide glass operations. The Company evaluates opportunities on a preliminary basis from time to time, but these transactions may not advance beyond the preliminary stages or be completed. Such acquisitions are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe inability to integrate effectively the operations, products, technologies and personnel of the acquired companies (some of which may be located in diverse geographic regions) and achieve expected synergies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe potential disruption of existing business and diversion of management's attention from day - to - day operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe need or obligation to divest portions of the acquired companies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe potential impairment of relationships with customers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe potential failure to identify material problems and liabilities during due diligence review of acquisition targets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe potential failure to obtain sufficient indemnification rights to fully offset possible liabilities associated with acquired businesses; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe challenges associated with operating in new geographic regions.. In addition, the Company cannot make assurances that the integration and consolidation of newly acquired businesses will achieve any anticipated cost savings and operating synergies.. 12. Table of Contents. Customer Consolidation - The continuing consolidation of the Company's customer base may intensify pricing pressures and have a material adverse effect on operations.. Many of the Company's largest customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines. This consolidation has increased the concentration of the Company's business with its largest customers. In many cases, such consolidation has been accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices, reflecting the increase in the total volume of products purchased or the elimination of a price differential between the acquiring customer and the company acquired. Increased pricing pressures from the Company's customers may have a material adverse effect on operations.. Operational Disruptions - Profitability could be affected by unanticipated operational disruptions.. The Company's glass container manufacturing process is asset intensive and includes the use of large furnaces and machines. The Company periodically experiences unanticipated disruptions to its assets and these events can have an adverse effect on its business operations and profitability. The impacts of these operational disruptions include, but are not limited to, higher maintenance, production changeover and shipping costs, higher capital spending, as well as lower absorption of fixed costs during periods of extended downtime. The Company maintains insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that are reasonable and in line with industry standards; however, this insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect the Company from all liabilities and expenses that may arise.. Seasonality - Profitability could be affected by varied seasonal demands.. Due principally to the seasonal nature of the consumption of beer and other beverages, for which demand is stronger during the summer months, sales of the Company's products have varied and are expected to vary by quarter. Shipments in the U.S. and Europe are typically greater in the second and third quarters of the year, while shipments in the Asia Pacific region are typically greater in the first and fourth quarters of the year, and shipments in Latin America are typically greater in the last three quarters of the year. Unseasonably cool weather during peak demand periods can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in the Company's containers.. Raw Materials - Profitability could be affected by the availability and cost of raw materials.. The raw materials that the Company uses have historically been available in adequate supply from multiple sources. For certain raw materials, however, there may be temporary shortages due to weather or other factors, including disruptions in supply caused by raw material transportation or production delays. These shortages, as well as material volatility in the cost of any of the principal raw materials that the Company uses, may have a material adverse effect on operations.. In addition, the Company purchases its soda ash raw materials in U.S. dollars in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. Given fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, this may cause these regions to experience inflationary or deflationary impacts to their raw material costs.. Environmental Risks - The Company is subject to various environmental legal requirements and may be subject to new legal requirements in the future. These requirements may have a material adverse effect on operations.. The Company's operations and properties are subject to extensive laws, ordinances, regulations and other legal requirements relating to environmental protection, including legal requirements governing investigation and clean - up of contaminated properties as well as water discharges, air emissions, waste management and workplace health and safety. Such legal requirements frequently change and vary among jurisdictions. The Company's operations and properties must comply with these legal requirements. These requirements may have a material adverse effect on operations.. The Company has incurred, and expects to incur, costs for its operations to comply with environmental legal requirements, and these costs could increase in the future. Many environmental legal requirements provide for substantial fines, orders (including orders to cease operations), and criminal sanctions for violations. These legal. 13. Table of Contents. requirements may apply to conditions at properties that the Company presently or formerly owned or operated, as well as at other properties for which the Company may be responsible, including those at which wastes attributable to the Company were disposed. A significant order or judgment against the Company, the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine may have a material adverse effect on operations.. A number of governmental authorities have enacted, or are considering enacting, legal requirements that would mandate certain rates of recycling, the use of recycled materials and/or limitations on certain kinds of packaging materials. In addition, some companies with packaging needs have responded to such developments and/or perceived environmental concerns of consumers by using containers made in whole or in part of recycled materials. Such developments may reduce the demand for some of the Company's products and/or increase the Company's costs, which may have a material adverse effect on operations.. Taxes - Potential tax law and U.S. trade policy changes could adversely affect net income and cash flow.. The Company is subject to income tax in the numerous jurisdictions in which it operates. Increases in income tax rates or other tax law changes, as well as ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities, could reduce the Company's net income and cash flow from affected jurisdictions. In particular, additional guidance is likely to be issued providing further clarification on the application of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Further, it is reasonable to expect that global taxing authorities will be reviewing current legislation for potential modifications in reaction to the implementation of the U.S. legislation. This additional guidance, along with the potential for additional global tax legislation changes, could have a material adverse impact on net income and cash flow by impacting significant deductions or income inclusions. In addition, the Company's products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value - added taxes in many jurisdictions in which it operates. Increases in these indirect taxes could affect the affordability of the Company's products and, therefore, reduce demand.. In addition, existing free trade laws and regulations, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where the Company manufactures products, such as Mexico, could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial results. Also, a government's adoption of \"buy national\" policies or retaliation by another government against such policies may affect the prices of and demand for the Company's products and could have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations.. Many international legislative and regulatory bodies have proposed legislation and begun investigations of the tax practices of multinational companies and, in the European Union (EU), the tax policies of certain EU member states. One of these efforts has been led by the OECD, an international association of 34 countries including the United States, which has finalized recommendations to revise corporate tax, transfer pricing, and tax treaty provisions in member countries. Since 2013, the European Commission (EC) has been investigating tax rulings granted by tax authorities in a number of EU member states with respect to specific multinational corporations to determine whether such rulings comply with EU rules on state aid, as well as more recent investigations of the tax regimes of certain EU member states. If the EC determines that a tax ruling or tax regime violates the state aid restrictions, the tax authorities of the affected EU member state may be required to collect back taxes for the period of time covered by the ruling. Due to the large scale of the Company's U.S. and international business activities, many of these proposed changes to the taxation of the Company's activities, if enacted, could increase the Company's worldwide effective tax rate and harm results of operations.. Labor Relations - Some of the Company's employees are unionized or represented by workers' councils.. The Company is party to a number of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions which at December 31, 2017, covered approximately 74% of the Company's employees in North America. The principal collective bargaining agreement, which at December 31, 2017 covered approximately 75% of the Company's. 14. Table of Contents. union - affiliated employees in North America, will expire on March 31, 2019. Approximately 82% of employees in Latin America are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The majority of the hourly workers in Australia and New Zealand are also covered by collective bargaining agreements. The collective bargaining agreements in Latin America, Australia and New Zealand have varying terms and expiration dates. Upon the expiration of any collective bargaining agreement, if the Company is unable to negotiate acceptable contracts with labor unions, it could result in strikes by the affected workers and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. In Europe, a large number of the Company's employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the U.S. Such employment rights require the Company to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements. For example, most of the Company's employees in Europe are represented by workers' councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment, including salaries and benefits and staff changes, and may impede efforts to restructure the Company's workforce. In addition, if the Company's employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, the Company could experience a significant disruption of operations and/or higher ongoing labor costs, which may have a material adverse effect on operations.. Key Management and Personnel Retention - Failure to retain key management and personnel could have a material adverse effect on operations.. The Company believes that its future success depends, in part, on its experienced management team and certain key personnel. The loss of certain key management and personnel could limit the Company's ability to implement its business plans and meet its objectives.. Joint Ventures - Failure by joint venture partners to observe their obligations could have a material adverse effect on operations.. A portion of the Company's operations is conducted through joint ventures, including joint ventures in the Europe, North America, Asia Pacific segments and in retained corporate costs and other. If the Company's joint venture partners do not observe their obligations or are unable to commit additional capital to the joint ventures, it is possible that the affected joint venture would not be able to operate in accordance with its business plans, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.. Cybersecurity and Information Technology - Security threats and the failure or disruption of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Company's information technology, or those of third parties, could have a material adverse effect on its business and the results of operations.. The Company relies on information technology (\"IT\") to operate its plants, to communicate with its employees, customers and suppliers, to store sensitive business information and intellectual property, and to report financial and operating results. In addition, the Company collects and stores certain data, including confidential or personal information of employees, customers and suppliers. As with all IT systems, the Company's IT system, or any third party's system on which the Company relies, could fail on its own accord or may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions due to events, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, sabotage, telecommunications failures, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks or computer crimes.. As the prevalence of cyberattacks on various organizations continues to increase, the Company's IT systems, or those of third parties, may be subject to increased security threats and the Company may incur additional costs to upgrade its security measures. The Company's measures in place to prevent and detect global security threats may be unable to prevent certain security breaches. This may result in transactional errors, business disruptions, loss or damage of intellectual property, loss of customers and business opportunities, unauthorized access to or disclosure of confidential or personal information, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, and additional compliance costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on operations. Any resulting costs or losses may not be covered by, or may exceed the coverage limits of the Company's cyber insurance.. 15. Table of Contents. Accounting Estimates - The Company's financial results are based upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results.. In preparing the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, several estimates and assumptions are made that affect the accounting for and recognition of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions must be made due to certain information used in the preparation of the Company's financial statements which is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. The Company believes that accounting for long - lived assets, pension benefit plans, contingencies and litigation, and income taxes involves the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Actual results for all estimates could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that the Company uses, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.. Accounting Standards - The adoption of new accounting standards or interpretations could adversely impact the Company's financial results.. New accounting standards or pronouncements could adversely affect the Company's operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in its results in future periods. The accounting rules and regulations that the Company must comply with are complex and continually changing. In addition, many companies' accounting policies are being subjected to heightened scrutiny by regulators and the public. The Company cannot predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or its accounting policies on its financial statements going forward. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, \"Leases\", which requires all operating leases with lease terms longer than twelve months be recorded as lease assets and lease liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Implementing changes required by this new standard will require a significant expenditure of time, attention and resources, including significant upgrades to and investments in the Company's lease administration systems and other accounting systems, and could result in significant adverse changes to our financial statements.. Goodwill - A significant write down of goodwill would have a material adverse effect on the Company's reported results of operations and net worth.. Goodwill at December 31, 2017 totaled $2.6 billion. The Company evaluates goodwill annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment using the required business valuation methods. These methods include the use of a weighted average cost of capital to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows of the Company's reporting units. Future changes in the cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors may cause the Company's goodwill to be impaired, resulting in a non - cash charge against results of operations to write down goodwill for the amount of the impairment. If a significant write down is required, the charge would have a material adverse effect on the Company's reported results of operations and net worth.. Pension Funding - An increase in the underfunded status of the Company's pension plans could adversely impact the Company's operations, financial condition and liquidity.. The Company contributed $31 million, $38 million and $17 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The amount the Company is required to contribute to these plans is determined by the laws and regulations governing each plan, and is generally related to the funded status of the plans. A deterioration in the value of the plans' investments or a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities generally would increase the underfunded status of the plans. An increase in the underfunded status of the plans could result in an increase in the Company's obligation to make contributions to the plans, thereby reducing the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses, and may have an adverse impact on the Company's operations, financial condition and liquidity."
