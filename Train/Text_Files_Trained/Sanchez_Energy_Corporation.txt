[1] "Item 1A.  Risk Factors. Our business involves a high degree of risk. You should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 - K, including the financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10 - K. If any of the following risks, or any risk described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 - K, were to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. The risks below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect us. This Annual Report on Form 10 - K also contains forward - looking statements, estimates and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward - looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks described below.  Also, please read \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\". 29. Table of Contents. Risks Related to Our Business. Market conditions for oil, natural gas and NGLs are highly volatile.  A sustained decline in prices for these commodities could adversely affect our revenue, cash flows, profitability and growth.. Prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors that are beyond our control, such as:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdomestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tweather conditions and the occurrence of natural disasters;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toverall domestic and global economic conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical and economic conditions in countries producing oil, natural gas and NGLs, including terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactions of OPEC and other state - controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe effect of increasing liquefied natural gas and exports from the United States;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe impact of the U.S. dollar exchange rates on prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttechnological advances affecting energy supply and energy consumption;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdomestic and foreign governmental regulations, including regulations prohibiting or restricting our ability to apply hydraulic fracturing to our wells, and taxation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe impact of energy conservation efforts and alternative fuel requirements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe proximity, capacity, cost and availability of production and transportation facilities for oil, natural gas and NGLs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of refining capacity; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe price and availability of, and consumer demand for, alternative fuels.. Governmental actions may also affect prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs.  In the past, prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs have been extremely volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue.  Beginning in the latter half of 2014, oil prices declined precipitously, and continued to decline throughout 2015 as well as the start 2016. Such downward volatility has negatively affected the amount of our net estimated proved reserves and has negatively affected the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of our net estimated proved reserves. Although we did not record a proved property impairment during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded proved property impairment of $3.7 million and $700.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.. In addition, our revenue, profitability and cash flow depend upon the prices of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs, and continued price volatility and low commodity prices, or a sustained drop in prices could negatively affect our financial results and impede our growth. In particular, sustained declines in commodity prices will:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimit our ability to enter into commodity derivative contracts at attractive prices;. 30. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduce the value and quantities of our reserves, because declines in prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs would reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can economically produce;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduce the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimit our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake it uneconomical for our operating partners to commence or continue production levels of oil, natural gas and NGLs.. An increase in the differential between the NYMEX or other benchmark prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs and the wellhead price we receive for our production could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. The prices that we receive for the oil, natural gas and NGLs that we produce at times may reflect differences between the relevant benchmark prices, such as NYMEX, that are used for calculating hedge positions. The difference between the benchmark price and the price we receive is called a basis differential. Increases in the basis differential between the benchmark prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs and the wellhead price we receive could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not have or currently plan to have any commodity derivative contracts covering the amount of the basis differentials we experience in respect of our production. As such, we will be exposed to any increase in such differentials, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. As of February 23, 2018,  we had commodity derivative contracts in place representing approximately 72% and 110% of the mid - point of our production of oil and natural gas projections, respectively, for 2018. In the future, we expect to continue to enter into commodity derivative contracts for a portion of our estimated production, which could result in net gains or losses on commodity derivatives. Our hedging strategy and future hedging transactions will be determined by our management in accordance with the terms of SN UnSub's organizational documents and any restrictions or limitations in our debt instruments.. The prices at which we enter into commodity derivative contracts covering our production in the future will be dependent upon conditions in the commodity and financial markets at the time we enter into these transactions, which may result in higher or lower hedge prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs under these contracts. Accordingly, our hedging strategy may not protect us from significant declines in the prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs for future production. Conversely, our hedging strategy may limit our ability to realize incremental cash flows from commodity price increases. As such, our hedging strategy may not protect us from changes in the price of oil, natural gas and NGLs, which could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.. Further declines in commodity prices or unsuccessful exploration efforts may result in write-downs of our asset carrying values.. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company changed its method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and development activities from full cost to the successful efforts method of accounting. All property and acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred, pending the determination of whether proved reserves have been discovered. If proved reserves are not discovered with an exploratory well, the costs of drilling the well are expensed. The capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties, on a field basis, cannot exceed the estimated future net cash flows of that field. If the net capitalized costs exceed future net revenues, we must write down the costs of each such field to our estimate of fair market value. Unproved properties are evaluated at the lower of cost or fair market value. Accordingly, a significant decline in oil or gas prices or unsuccessful exploration efforts could cause a future write-down of capitalized costs.. We review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. The impairment analysis is based on then current oil and gas prices in effect. Once incurred, a write-down of oil and gas properties cannot. 31. Table of Contents. be reversed at a later date even if oil or gas prices increase. As a result, substantial and sustained declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures.. The Company's derivative risk management activities could result in financial losses.. To mitigate the effect of commodity price volatility on the Company's net cash provided by operating activities, support the Company's annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects, our strategy is to enter into derivative contracts covering a portion the Company's production. These derivative arrangements are subject to mark - to - market accounting treatment, and the changes in fair market value of the contracts are reported in the Company's statements of operations each quarter, which may result in significant non - cash gains or losses. After the current hedges expire, there is significant uncertainty that we will be able to put new hedges in place that will provide us with the same benefit. These derivative contracts may also expose the Company to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including when:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduction is less than the contracted derivative volumes, in which case we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our hedging obligations without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe counterparty to the derivative contract defaults on its contractual obligations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthere is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge instrument; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe derivative contracts limit the benefit the Company would otherwise receive from increases in commodity prices.. Such financial losses could materially impact our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.. The Comanche Acquisition or any other acquisition we may undertake involve risks associated with acquisitions and integration of acquired assets, and the intended benefits of the Comanche Acquisition or any other acquisition we may undertake may not be realized.. The Comanche Acquisition or any other acquisition we may undertake involve risks associated with acquisitions and integrating acquired assets into existing operations, including that:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour senior management's attention may be diverted from the management of daily operations with respect to our Catarina area and our other legacy assets to the integration of the assets acquired in the Comanche Acquisition or other acquisition;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe could incur significant unknown and contingent liabilities for which we have limited or no contractual remedies or insurance coverage;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be unable to achieve the economies of scale that we expect from integrating the Comanche Assets or any other assets we may acquire into our existing operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe assets acquired in the Comanche Acquisition or any other acquisition we may undertake may not perform as well as we anticipate; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunexpected costs, delays and challenges may arise in integrating the assets acquired in the Comanche Acquisition or any other acquisition we may undertake into our existing operations.. 32. Table of Contents. Even if we successfully integrate assets acquired in an acquisition, it may not be possible to realize the full benefits we anticipate or we may not realize these benefits within the expected timeframe. If we fail to realize the benefits we anticipate from the Comanche Acquisition or any other acquisition we may undertake, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.. Under the terms of the lease with respect to the Catarina assets and under the terms of the Comanche development agreement, we are subject to annual drilling and development requirements and failure to comply with these requirements may result in loss of our interests in the Catarina area that are not held by production or sizable default payments to Anadarko, respectively.. In order to protect our exploration and development rights in the Catarina area, we are required to drill 50 wells per year (measured from July 1 to June 30). If we fail to meet the minimum drilling commitment under the terms of the lease for our Catarina properties (the \"Catarina Lease\"), we could forfeit our acreage under the Catarina Lease and rights to develop land not held by production (excluding, in certain instances, associated rights such as midstream assets). If we drill more than 50 wells in a prescribed twelve month period, we may apply such additional wells (up to a maximum of 30 additional wells) toward the following prescribed twelve month period's 50-well requirements. In addition, the Catarina Lease requires us to go no longer than 120 days without spudding a well, and, under the terms of the Catarina Lease, failure to do so could result in the forfeiture of our acreage under the Catarina Lease and rights to develop land not held by production (excluding, in certain instances, acreage upon which associated midstream assets are located).. We also entered into a development agreement (the \"Development Agreement\") with Anadarko regarding the Comanche Assets pursuant to which we commit to completing and equipping 60 wells per year for 5 years, in addition to other requirements in the leases that must be adhered to in order to maintain our acreage position. If we complete and equip more than 60 wells in a year, we may apply such additional wells (up to a maximum of 30 additional wells) toward the 60-well requirement in subsequent annual periods. If we fail to complete and equip the required number of wells in a given year (after applying any qualifying additional wells from previous years), we must pay Anadarko a default fee of $200,000 for each well we fail to timely complete and equip.. Our drilling plans for our undeveloped leasehold acreage are subject to change based upon various factors, including factors that are beyond our control, such as drilling results, prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. Because of these uncertainties, we cannot assure you that we will be able meet our obligations under the Catarina Lease or the Development Agreement. If the Catarina Lease expires, we will lose our right to develop the related properties on this acreage, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to meet our obligations under the Development Agreement we will have to pay Anadarko the applicable default fees, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our agreements with Blackstone and GSO Capital Partners LP (\"GSO\") will restrict us from transferring our right, title and interest to the Comanche Assets.. Under the terms of the joint development agreement with Blackstone ( the \"JDA\"), except under limited circumstances, neither we nor Blackstone can transfer any of our rights, title or interest to any asset or related assets (including any working interests) prior to the third anniversary of the JDA.  In addition, under our agreements with GSO, we are not able to dispose of all or a substantial portion of the Comanche Assets without GSO's consent.  These restrictions may prohibit us from taking advantage of certain opportunities, including our ability to sell these assets, which may arise from time to time.. 33. Table of Contents. The JDA contains right of first offer (\"ROFO\") and tag-along provisions that may hinder our ability to sell our interest in the Comanche Assets within our desired time frame or on our desired terms, and could delay or prevent an acquisition of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.. Under the terms of the JDA, both parties have a ROFO in the event that the other party intends to sell or otherwise transfer its interests.  In addition, the JDA provides both parties with a tag-along right in the event that the other party intends to sell at least 35% of its total interests to a third-party purchaser (including upon a change of control transaction involving us). These features could limit third-party offers, inhibit our ability to sell our interests or adversely affect the timing of any sale of our interests and our ability to obtain the highest price possible in the event that we decide to market or sell our interests. In addition, the tag-along provisions of the JDA may also frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders or a third party to replace or remove our current management or to acquire an interest in or engage in other corporate transactions with us, by subjecting certain corporate change of control transactions to a tag-along provision pursuant to which a third party may be required to acquire Blackstone's interest in the Comanche Assets if it desires to enter into a corporate transaction with us.. The JDA establishes an operating committee for the Comanche Assets that keeps us from having unilateral control over many key variables of operation and development of the Comanche Assets and also provides for certain circumstances under which we could be removed as operator.. The JDA provides for the administration, operation and transfer of the jointly-owned Comanche Assets. Pursuant to the JDA, the parties thereto established an operating committee, which controls the timing, scope and budgeting of operations on the Comanche Assets (subject to certain exceptions). Although we are designated as operator of the Comanche Assets under the JDA, under certain circumstances we may be removed as operator and, furthermore, because we do not control the operating committee we do not have unilateral control over many key variables of the operation and development of the Comanche Assets, including the establishment of the budget and development plan for the Comanche Assets. There can be no assurance that Blackstone will continue its relationship with us in the future or that we will be able to pursue our stated strategies with respect to the Comanche Assets. Furthermore, Blackstone may (a) have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours; (b) take actions contrary to our policies or objectives; (c) undergo a change of control; (d) experience financial and other difficulties; or (e) be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the JDA, which may affect our financial conditions or results of operations.. Under the amended and restated limited liability company agreement of SN UnSub and the limited liability company agreement of SN UnSub's general partner, GSO consent is required to take certain actions.. Under the amended and restated limited partnership agreement of SN UnSub and limited liability company agreement of SN UnSub's general partner, we are not able to cause SN UnSub or its general partner to take or not to take certain actions unless GSO consents. GSO made a substantial investment (including contributions and other commitments) in SN UnSub at the closing of the Comanche Acquisition and, accordingly, has required that the relevant organizational documents of SN UnSub and its general partner contain certain features designed to provide it with the opportunity to participate in the management of SN UnSub and its general partner and to protect its investment in SN UnSub, as well as any other assets which may be substantially dependent on or otherwise affected by the activities of SN UnSub.  These participation and protective features include a governance structure that consists of a board of directors of SN UnSub's general partner, only some of whom are appointed by us. Thus, without the concurrence of GSO, we will not be able to cause SN UnSub and its general partner to take or not to take certain actions, even though those actions may be in the best interest of SN UnSub, its general partner, or us. Furthermore, we, and GSO may have different or conflicting goals or interests which could make it more difficult or time-consuming to obtain any necessary approvals or consents to pursue activities that we believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders. See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  -  Liquidity and Capital Resources.\". 34. Table of Contents. Our estimated reserves and future production rates are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our estimated reserves.. Numerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating reserves of oil, natural gas and NGLs and future production. It is not possible to measure underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGLs in an exact way. Reserve engineering is complex, requiring subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGLs and assumptions concerning future prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs, future production levels and operating and development costs. In estimating our reserves of oil, natural gas and NGLs, we and our independent reserve engineers make certain assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, including assumptions relating to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprices for oil, natural gas and NGLs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfuture production levels;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcapital expenditures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toperating and development costs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe effects of regulation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe accuracy and reliability of the underlying engineering and geologic data; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of funds.. If these assumptions prove to be incorrect, our estimates of our reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs attributable to any particular group of properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and our estimates of the future net cash flows from our estimated reserves could change significantly. For example, with other factors held constant, if the commodity prices used in our reserve report as of December 31, 2017 had decreased by 10%, then the standardized measure of our estimated proved reserves as of that date would have decreased by approximately $511.8 million, from approximately $1,886.1 million to approximately $1,374.3 million.. Our standardized measure is calculated using unhedged prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs and is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Over time, we may make material changes to reserve estimates to take into account changes in our assumptions and the results of actual development and production.. The reserve estimates we make for wells or fields that do not have a lengthy production history are less reliable than estimates for wells or fields with lengthy production histories. A lack of production history may contribute to inaccuracy in our estimates of proved reserves, future production rates and the timing of development expenditures.. Our estimated reserves of oil, natural gas and NGLs will naturally decline over time, and we may be unable to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our future reserves of oil, natural gas and NGLs, production volumes, and cash flow depend on our success in developing and exploiting our current reserves efficiently and finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves economically. Our estimated reserves of oil, natural gas and NGLs will naturally decline over time as they are produced. Our success depends on our ability to economically develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our own current and future production. If we are unable to do so, or if expected development is delayed, reduced or cancelled, the average decline rates will likely increase.. 35. Table of Contents. Developing and producing oil, natural gas and NGLs are costly and high - risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. The cost of developing, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a well. Additionally, drilling wells with no or sub-economic levels of production (dry holes) will negatively impact our financial position. In addition, our use of 2D and 3D seismic data and visualization techniques to identify subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures and requires additional pre - development expenditures. Furthermore, our development and production operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of other factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thigh costs, shortages or delivery delays of rigs, equipment, labor or other services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcomposition of sour gas, including sulfur and mercaptan content;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunexpected operational events and conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treductions in prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreases in severance taxes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse weather conditions and natural disasters;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfacility or equipment malfunctions and equipment failures or accidents, including acceleration of deterioration of our facilities and equipment due to the highly corrosive nature of sour gas;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttitle problems;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpipe or cement failures, casing collapses or other downhole failures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompliance with ever - changing environmental and other governmental requirements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenvironmental hazards, such as chemical or hydrocarbon leaks or spills, salt water leaks or spills, pipeline ruptures, discharges of toxic gases or other releases of hazardous substances;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlost or damaged oilfield development and service tools;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunusual or unexpected geological formations and pressure or irregularities in formations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of drilling fluid circulation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfires, blowouts, surface craterings and explosions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tuncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, NGLs or well fluids;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of leases due to incorrect payment of royalties;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimited availability of financing at acceptable rates; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother hazards, including those associated with sour gas such as an accidental discharge of hydrogen sulfide gas, that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and suspension of operations.. 36. Table of Contents. If any of these factors were to occur with respect to a particular field, we could lose all or a part of our investment in the field, or we could fail to realize the expected benefits from the field, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We routinely apply hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion operations. Hydraulic fracturing has recently become subject to increased public scrutiny and recent changes in federal and state law, as well as proposed legislative changes, could significantly restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing. Such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from dense subsurface rock formations and, in the event of local prohibitions against commercial production of natural gas, may preclude our ability to drill wells. In addition, such laws could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. If hydraulic fracturing becomes regulated at the federal level as a result of federal legislation or regulatory initiatives by the EPA or other federal agencies, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements and result in permitting delays, financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements, as well as potential increases in costs. Please read \" - Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays\" and \"Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters and Regulation - Water and Other Water Discharges and Spills.\". Additionally, hydraulic fracturing, drilling, transportation and processing of hydrocarbons bear an inherent risk of loss of containment. Potential consequences include loss of reserves, loss of production, loss of economic value associated with the affected wellbore, contamination of soil, ground water, and surface water, as well as potential fines, penalties or damages associated with any of the foregoing consequences.. Our acquisition, development and production operations require us to make substantial capital expenditures. Although we expect to fund our capital expenditure budget for 2018 using cash flow from operations and cash on hand, if our cash flow from operations turns out to be less than we currently expect and we are required, but are unable, to fund our remaining capital budget from other sources, such as borrowings under our amended and restated credit facility and/or the issuance of debt or equity securities, our failure to obtain the funds that we need could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. The oil and natural gas industry in which we operate is capital intensive and we must make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the acquisition, development and production of oil, natural gas and NGLs. Our cash on hand, cash flows from operations, ability to borrow and access to capital markets are subject to a number of variables, many of which are beyond our control, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour estimated reserves of proved oil, natural gas and NGLs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe prices at which we sell our production;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe results of our hedging strategy;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe costs of developing, producing, and transporting our oil, natural gas and NGLs, including costs attributable to governmental regulation and taxation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in our working capital needs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinterest payments, debt service and dividend payment requirements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprevailing economic and capital markets conditions, especially for oil and gas companies;. 37. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour financial condition; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability and willingness of banks and other lenders to lend to us.. In addition, we may be unable to access the capital markets for debt or equity financing. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining the funds we need to fund our capital budget, we will be forced to reduce our capital expenditures, which in turn could lead to a decline in our production, revenues and our reserves, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our stock price has been volatile, and investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses.. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our stock price had a low closing price of $3.75 per share and a high closing price per share of $14.24 per share. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price at which they purchased their shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe price of oil, natural gas and NGLs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe success of our exploration and development operations, and the marketing of any oil we produce;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory developments in the United States;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tquarterly or annual variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmarket conditions in the industries in which we compete and issuance of new or changed securities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tanalyst reports or recommendations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock or changes in financial estimates by analysts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thigher than achievable estimates by analysts who follow our common stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour issuance of any additional securities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinvestor perception of our company and of the industry in which we compete; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic, political and market conditions.. Certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage or the leases are extended.. Certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire unless production in paying quantities is established during their primary terms or we obtain extensions of the leases. Our drilling plans for our undeveloped leasehold acreage are subject to change based upon various factors, including factors that are beyond our control, such as drilling results, prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if our undeveloped leasehold acreage will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil, natural gas or NGLs from these or any other potential drilling locations. If our leases expire and we do not have them held by production, we will lose our right to develop the related properties on this acreage.. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 76% of our acreage was held by production and/or continuous operations. As of December 31, 2017, we had leases that were not held by production representing 15.1 thousand net. 38. Table of Contents. acres (all which were in the Eagle Ford Shale) expiring in 2018, 7.8 thousand net acres (7.2 thousand of which were in the Eagle Ford Shale) expiring in 2019, and 58.3 thousand net acres (46.5 thousand of which were in the Eagle Ford Shale) expiring in 2020 and beyond. While we anticipate that our current and future drilling plans will address the majority of our leases expiring in the Eagle Ford Shale in 2018, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.. Our identified drilling location inventories are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.. Our management has specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future drilling activities on our existing acreage. These identified drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including the availability of capital, seasonal conditions, regulatory approvals, prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs, costs and drilling results. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil, natural gas or NGLs from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We may be unable to compete effectively with larger companies, which may adversely affect our ability to generate revenue.. The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive with respect to acquiring prospects and properties, the marketing of oil, natural gas and NGLs, and securing equipment and trained personnel. Many of our competitors are large independent oil and natural gas companies that possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than those of the Sanchez Group. Those entities may be able to develop and acquire more properties than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Many of our larger competitors not only drill for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties and evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties than our financial, technical or personnel resources permit. In addition, there is substantial competition for investment capital in the oil and natural gas industry. These larger companies may have a greater ability to continue development activities during periods of lower prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs and to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations. Furthermore, we may not be able to aggregate sufficient quantities of production to compete with larger companies that are able to sell greater volumes of production to intermediaries, thereby reducing the realized prices attributable to our production. Any inability to compete effectively with larger companies could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be adequately insured.. There are a variety of operating risks inherent in our wells and other operating properties and facilities, such as leaks, explosions, mechanical problems and natural disasters, all of which could cause substantial financial losses. Any of these or other similar occurrences could result in the disruption of our operations, substantial repair costs, personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial revenue losses. The location of our wells and other operating properties and facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could significantly increase the level of damages resulting from these risks.. Insurance against all operational risks is not available to us. We are not fully insured against all risks, including development and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Additionally, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the perceived risks presented. Losses could, therefore, occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. Moreover,. 39. Table of Contents. insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable costs or on commercially reasonable terms. Changes in the insurance markets due to weather, adverse economic conditions, and the aftermath of the Macondo well incident in the Gulf of Mexico have made it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of coverage. As a result, we may not be able to obtain the levels or types of insurance we would otherwise have obtained prior to these market changes, and we cannot be sure the insurance coverage we do obtain will not contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain hazards or cover all potential losses. Losses and liabilities from uninsured and underinsured events and delay in the payment of insurance proceeds could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our lack of diversification increases the risk of an investment in us and we are vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major contiguous area.. Our current business focus is on the oil and natural gas industry in a limited number of properties, in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and, to a lesser extent, the TMS in Southwest Mississippi and Southeast Louisiana. Larger companies have the ability to manage their risk by diversification. However, we currently lack diversification, in terms of both the nature and geographic scope of our business. For example, our Catarina assets, comprised of approximately 106,000 contiguous net acres in Dimmit, LaSalle and Webb Counties, Texas under the Catarina Lease, represent approximately 53% of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2017, approximately 37% of our Eagle Ford acreage as of December 31, 2017 and approximately 56% of our total production volumes for the year ended December 31, 2017.  As a result, we will likely be impacted more acutely by factors affecting our industry or the regions in which we operate than we would if our business were more diversified, increasing our risk profile. In particular, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production from wells in which we have an interest that are caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of oil or natural gas produced from wells in the Eagle Ford Shale. Due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. We cannot control activities on properties that we do not operate and are unable to control their proper operation and profitability.. We do not operate all of the properties in which we own an ownership interest. As a result, we have limited ability to exercise influence over, and control the risks associated with, the operations of these non - operated properties. The failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations, an operator's breach of the applicable agreements or an operator's failure to act in ways that are in our best interests could reduce our production, revenues and reserves. The success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe nature and timing of the operator's drilling and other activities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing and amount of required capital expenditures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe operator's geological and engineering expertise and financial resources;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe approval of other participants in drilling wells; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe operator's selection of suitable technology.. 40. Table of Contents. Our ability to produce oil and natural gas could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling and completion operations or are unable to dispose of the water we use at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules.. Water is an essential component of oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Drought conditions have persisted in our areas of operation in past years. These drought conditions have led governmental authorities to restrict the use of water, subject to their jurisdiction, for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supplies. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations, we may be unable to economically produce oil and natural gas, which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. Furthermore, the Clean Water Act imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters and other oil and natural gas waste into navigable waters. In addition, the underground injection of fluids is subject to permitting and other requirements under state laws and regulation. Public concerns regarding the potential impacts to groundwater and induced seismic activity have resulted in new requirements related to the underground injection and disposal of fluids.   The EPA is also examining regulatory requirements for \"indirect dischargers\" of wastewater  -  i.e., those that send their discharges to private or publicly owned treatment facilities, which treat the wastewater before discharging it to regulated waters. Compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the discharge of underground injection of fluids and the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted.. We may lose our rights to the Sanchez Group's technological database, including its 3D and 2D seismic data, under certain circumstances.. Pursuant to the Services Agreement, we have access to the unrestricted, proprietary portions of the technological database owned and maintained by the Sanchez Group and related to our properties, and SOG is otherwise required to interpret and use the database, to the extent relating to our properties, for our benefit under the Services Agreement. For a description of the Services Agreement see \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  - Note 10, Related Party Transactions\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10 - K. This database includes the 2D and 3D seismic data used for our exploration and development projects as well as the well logs, LAS files, scanned well documents and other well documents and software that are necessary for our daily operations. This information is critical for the operation and expansion of our business. Under certain circumstances, including if SOG provides at least 180 days' advance written notice of its desire to terminate the Services Agreement, the license agreement will terminate and we will lose our rights to this technological database unless members of the Sanchez Group permit us to retain some or all of these rights, which they may decline to do in their sole discretion. In such event, we are unlikely to be able to obtain rights to similar information under substantially similar commercial terms or to continue our business operations as proposed and our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and it could delay or prevent an acquisition of us.. If we do not purchase additional acreage or make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, our future growth will be limited.. Our ability to grow depends in part on our ability to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms. We may be unable to make such acquisitions because we are:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with their owners;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunable to obtain financing for such acquisitions on economically acceptable terms; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toutbid by competitors.. 41. Table of Contents. If we are unable to acquire properties containing estimated proved reserves, our total level of estimated proved reserves will decline as a result of our production.. Any acquisitions we complete or geographic expansions we undertake will be subject to substantial risks that could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Any acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmistaken assumptions about estimated proved reserves, future production, revenues, capital expenditures, operating expenses and costs, including synergies, timing of expected development and the potential for expiration of underlying leaseholds;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tan inability to successfully integrate the assets or businesses we acquire;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta decrease in our liquidity by using a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents to finance acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur debt to finance acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which any indemnity we receive is inadequate;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmistaken assumptions about the overall cost of equity or debt;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tan inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our growing business and assets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfacts and circumstances that could give rise to significant cash and certain non - cash charges; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcustomer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses.. Further, we may in the future expand our operations into new geographic areas with operating conditions and a regulatory environment that may not be as familiar to us as our existing project areas. As a result, we may encounter obstacles that may cause us not to achieve the expected results of any such acquisitions, and any adverse conditions, regulations or developments related to any assets acquired in new geographic areas may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our decision to acquire a property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses and seismic data and other information, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations. Our reviews of acquired properties are inherently incomplete because it generally is not feasible to perform an in - depth review of the individual properties involved in each acquisition, given time constraints imposed by sellers. Even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken.. We adopted the Rights Plan, which though it was designed to preserve the value of our net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\"), may discourage the acquisition and sale of large blocks of our common stock and may result in significant dilution for certain stockholders.. On July 28, 2015, the Company entered into an NOLs rights plan (the \"Rights Plan\") designed to preserve. 42. Table of Contents. stockholder value and the value of our NOLs by acting as a deterrent to any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock without the approval of our board of directors. The Rights Plan may discourage existing 5% common stockholders from selling their interest in a single block, which may impact the liquidity of the Company's common stock, may deter institutional investors from investing in our common stock, and may deter potential acquirers from making premium offers to acquire the Company, factors which may depress the market price of our common stock. We can make no assurances the Rights Plan will be effective in meeting its intended objectives, including to deter a change in control and protecting or realizing NOLs.. If we were to experience an ownership change, we could be limited in our ability to use NOLs arising prior to the ownership change to offset future taxable income.. As of December 31, 2017, we had NOLs of $1,737.7 million. If we were to experience an \"ownership change,\" as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), our ability to offset taxable income arising after the ownership change with NOLs arising prior to the ownership change would be limited, possibly substantially. An ownership change would establish an annual limitation on the amount of our pre - change NOLs we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any future taxable year to an amount generally equal to the value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long - term tax - exempt rate. In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in our ownership of more than 50 percentage points by one or more \"5% shareholders\" (as defined in the Code) at any time during a rolling three - year period.. Our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cyber-security threats, and other disruptions.. As an oil and natural gas producer, we face various security threats, including cyber-security threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, threats to the safety of our employees, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines, and threats from terrorist acts. Cyber-security attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.. We may be able to incur substantially more debt. This could exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness.. Despite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including under our SN UnSub Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2017, we had $1.93 billion of debt outstanding, net of premium, discount and debt issuance costs, the majority of which was attributable to the Senior Notes (as defined in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  -  Note 6, Debt\"), a borrowing base of $350 million (with an aggregate elected commitment amount of $300 million) under our prior revolving credit facility for secured revolver borrowings, and a borrowing base of $330 million under our SN UnSub Credit Agreement. On February 14, 2018, we issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.25% Senior Secured Notes and amended and restated our prior revolving credit facility. See 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  -  Note 20, Subsequent Events.\" Subject to compliance with specified borrowing conditions and other covenants, the indenture for the 7.25% Senior Secured Notes and the indenture for the Senior Notes would allow us to incur additional debt. Our increased indebtedness could adversely affect our business. In particular, the incurrence of additional debt could increase our vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.. 43. Table of Contents. Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.. We will be subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our amended and restated credit facility and our SN UnSub Credit Agreement, which bear interest at variable rates. Interest rate changes could affect the amount of our interest payments under these credit facilities and, accordingly, our future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. We currently do not have any interest rate hedging arrangements with respect to our credit facilities. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of fixed-for-floating interest rate payments in order to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility; however, any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. A significant increase in prevailing interest rates that results in a substantial increase in the interest rates applicable to our indebtedness could substantially increase our interest expense and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. Restrictive covenants may adversely affect our operations.. Our amended and restated credit facility, the indentures governing the Senior Notes, the indenture governing the 7.25% Senior Secured Notes and our SN UnSub Credit Agreement contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long - term best interest, including our ability, among other things, to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur or assume additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tissue redeemable stock and preferred stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake loans and investments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcreate or incur liens;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrict distributions from our subsidiaries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconsolidate or merge with or into another entity, or sell all or substantially all of our assets; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into new lines of business.. A breach of the covenants under the indentures governing the Senior Notes, the indenture governing the 7.25% Senior Secured Notes, the covenants under our amended and restated credit facility or the covenants under our SN UnSub Credit Agreement could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. An event of default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in an acceleration of any other debt that contains a cross - acceleration or cross - default provision (however, a default under our amended and restated credit facility, the Senior Notes or the 7.25% Senior Secured Notes would not result in a  default under or the acceleration of our SN UnSub Credit Agreement and a default under our SN UnSub Credit Agreement would not result in a  default under or the acceleration of our amended and restated credit facility, Senior Notes or 7.25% Senior Secured Notes). In addition, an event of default under our amended and restated credit facility or our SN UnSub Credit Agreement would permit the lenders under the relevant facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. If we were unable to repay those amounts or amounts due to holders of our 7.25% Senior Secured Notes, the lenders under our amended and restated credit facility or our SN UnSub Credit Agreement or the holders of our 7.25% Senior Secured Notes, as applicable, could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt. Additionally, if we do not repay the approximately $24 million in borrowings due under Sanchez Resources, LLC's (\"Sanchez Resources\") credit. 44. Table of Contents. facility or successfully renegotiate the terms of such facility, then the administrative agent or the lenders under that facility could proceed against the collateral securing that debt, consisting of substantially all of Sanchez Resources' TMS assets (approximately 12,500 net acres). See \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  -  Note 10. Related Party Transactions\".. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt.. The aggregate amount of our outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences for us, including the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt agreements, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe covenants contained in our debt agreements limit our ability to borrow money in the future for acquisitions, capital expenditures or to meet our operating expenses or other general corporate obligations and may limit our flexibility in operating our business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our industry or the economy in general, especially extended or further declines in oil and natural gas prices; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.. Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulation. We cannot be certain that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. If we do not have enough cash to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity. We may not be able to refinance our debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all.. Because we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors may deem relevant. Covenants contained in our amended and restated credit facility, future credit facilities we may enter into, our indentures and the certificates of designations for our preferred stock restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. In addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\") permits payment of dividends only out of a corporation's surplus, which is defined as the excess of net assets (total assets less total liabilities) over a corporation's capital as determined under the DGCL. If commodity prices decline, the value of our net assets will decline and, accordingly, our ability to lawfully declare and pay dividends may also decline.  Investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.. 45. Table of Contents. Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common process used by oil and natural gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and natural gas wells whereby water, sand and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate production of oil and/or natural gas. Hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from federal regulation, and thus the process is typically regulated by state agencies. Nevertheless, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the Underground Injection Control or UIC Program. In Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, where we maintain acreage, the EPA is encouraging state programs to review and consider EPA guidance in these areas. In addition, the EPA previously announced its plans to develop a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by June 2018, which would describe a proposed mechanism  -  regulatory, voluntary, or a combination of both  -  to collect data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures.. On May 12, 2016, the EPA amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and VOC emissions for certain new, modified, and reconstructed equipment, processes, and activities across the oil and natural gas sector. However, in a March 28, 2017 executive order, President Trump directed the EPA to review the 2016 regulations and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise them consistent with the stated policy of promoting clean and safe development of the nation's energy resources, while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production. On June 16, 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay for two years certain requirements of the 2016 regulations, including fugitive emission requirements. These standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions.. Furthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices.  These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing or the disposal of produced water and flowback fluid in underground injection wells. Also, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or otherwise require the public disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process, and a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country alleging that hydraulic fracturing practices have induced seismic activity and adversely impacted drinking water supplies, use of surface water, and the environment generally.   These proceedings or regulations or any other new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing or the disposal of produced water and flowback fluid in underground injection wells could make it more difficult or costly for us to drill and produce from conventional or tight formations, increase our costs of compliance and doing business and make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings.. Further federal, state and/or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business that may arise if additional federal, state and/or local laws are enacted. Please read \"Item 1. Business  -  Environmental Matters and Regulation\" for a description of the laws and regulations governing hydraulic fracturing.. Legislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity could restrict our drilling and production activities, as well as our ability to dispose of produced water gathered from such activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.. State and federal regulatory agencies have recently focused on a possible connection between hydraulic fracturing related activities, particularly the underground injection of wastewater into disposal wells, and the increased. 46. Table of Contents. occurrence of seismic activity, and regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed in some states, most recently in Oklahoma, alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. In response to these concerns, regulators in some states are seeking to impose additional requirements, including requirements regarding the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess the relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, on October 28, 2014, the Commission adopted disposal well rule amendments designed, among other things, to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive non-hazardous produced water or other oil and gas waste to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey. The searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well. If the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the produced water or other fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity, then the agency may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well. The Commission has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells.. We dispose of large volumes of produced water gathered from our drilling and production operations by injecting it into wells pursuant to permits issued to us by governmental authorities overseeing such disposal activities. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change, which could result in the imposition of more stringent operating constraints or new monitoring and reporting requirements, owing to, among other things, concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such gathering or disposal activities. The adoption and implementation of any new laws or regulations that restrict our ability to use hydraulic fracturing or dispose of produced water gathered from our drilling and production activities by owned disposal wells, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations. In addition, the third parties on whom we rely on for gathering and transportation services are also subject to complex federal, state and other laws that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our business.. Our oil and natural gas development and production operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. To conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Please read \"Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters and Regulation\" for a description of the laws and regulations that affect us.. In addition, the operations of the third parties on whom we rely for gathering and transportation services are also subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations that require obtaining and maintaining numerous permits, approvals and certifications from various federal, state and local government authorities. These third parties may incur substantial costs in order to comply with existing laws and regulations. If existing laws and regulations governing such third - party services are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to their operations, these changes may affect the costs that we pay for such services. Similarly, a failure to comply with such laws and regulations by the third parties on whom we rely could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Please read \"Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters and Regulation\" for a description of the laws and regulations that affect the third parties on whom we rely.. Climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.. In recent years, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of GHGs. The EPA has finalized a series of GHG monitoring, reporting and emission control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and the U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions.  Almost one-half of the. 47. Table of Contents. states have already taken measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs.. Furthermore, in December 2015, the United States participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP-21) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake \"ambitious efforts\" to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016 and establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce GHG emissions.  However, on June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and begin negotiations to either re-enter or negotiate an entirely new agreement with more favorable terms for the United States. The Paris Agreement sets forth a specific exit process, whereby a party may not provide notice of its withdrawal until three years from the effective date, with such withdrawal taking effect one year from such notice. It is not clear what steps the Trump Administration plans to take to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, whether a new agreement can be negotiated, or what terms would be included in such an agreement. Furthermore, in response to the announcement, many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international record.. Restrictions on GHG emissions that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and gas industry. The adoption of any legislation or regulations that otherwise limit emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to monitor and report GHG emissions, purchase and operate emissions control systems to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory requirements. Any GHG emissions legislation or regulatory programs applicable to power plants or refineries could also increase the cost of consuming, and thus could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Please read \"Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters and Regulation.\". In addition, there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension and endowment funds promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities, operations and ability to access capital. Furthermore, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that GHG emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals or public entities may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury or property damages or other liabilities. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.. Moreover, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially hotter or colder than their historical averages. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations.. Our operations are subject to environmental and operational safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.. We may incur significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of stringent and complex environmental, health and safety requirements applicable to our oil and natural gas development and production operations. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations, including that they may (i) require the acquisition of permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations; (ii) restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected into formations in connection. 48. Table of Contents. with oil and natural gas drilling, production and transportation activities; (iii) govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process; (iv) limit or prohibit drilling or injection activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, seismically active areas, and other protected areas; (v) require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; (vi) result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations; (vii) impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations; and (viii) require that additional pollution controls be installed. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly compliance or corrective actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and, in some instances, the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time.. There is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations due to our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, because of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations, and as a result of historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination or the operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. Private parties, including the owners of properties upon which our wells are drilled and facilities where our petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non - compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages. In addition, the risk of accidental spills or releases could expose us to significant liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste control, handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance. Please read \"Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters and Regulation\" for more information.. Derivatives reform legislation and related regulations could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.. The July 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, provides for federal oversight of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or the CFTC, the SEC and certain federal regulators of financial institutions, or Prudential Regulators, adopt rules or regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act and providing definitions of terms used in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain market participants and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail or cease their derivatives activities.. Although some of the rules necessary to implement the Dodd-Frank Act remain to be adopted, the CFTC, the SEC and the Prudential Regulators have issued many rules to implement the Dodd-Frank Act, including a rule, which we refer to as the \"Mandatory Clearing Rule,\" requiring clearing of hedges, or swaps, that are subject to it (currently, only certain interest rate and credit default swaps, which we do not presently have), a rule, which we refer to as the \"End User Exception,\" establishing an \"end user\" exception to the Mandatory Clearing Rule, a rule, which we refer to as the \"Margin Rule,\" setting forth collateral requirements in connection with swaps that are not cleared and also an exception to the Margin Rule for end users that are not financial end users, which exception we refer to as the \"Non-Financial End User Exception,\" and a rule, subsequently vacated by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and remanded to the CFTC for further proceedings, imposing position limits on energy derivatives. On multiple occasions,. 49. Table of Contents. most recently in December 2016, the CFTC proposed but did not adopt other position limit rules on energy derivatives. Such proposed rules have included exemptions from the position limits for swaps that constitute \"bona fide hedging positions\" within the definition of such term under such proposed rules, subject to the party claiming the exemption complying with the applicable filing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements of such proposed rules. It is not known whether the CFTC will adopt a rule which we refer to as a \"Position Limit Rule\" imposing position limits on energy derivatives or, if such a rule is adopted, whether such rule will include an exemption for \"bona fide hedging positions\". Nor is it known if our hedging activities will constitute \"bona fide hedging positions\" under any such Position Limit Rule.. We qualify for the End User Exception and will utilize it if the Mandatory Clearing Rule is expanded to cover swaps in which we participate and we qualify for the Non-Financial End User Exception and will not be required to post margin under the Margin Rule, so we do not expect to be directly affected by any of such rules. However, most if not all of our hedge counterparties will be subject to mandatory clearing in connection with their hedging activities with parties who do not qualify for the End User Exception and will be required to post margin in connection with their hedging activities with other swap dealers, major swap participants, financial end users and other persons that do not qualify for the Non-Financial End User Exception.  In addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations (including laws and regulations giving European Union financial authorities the power to write down amounts we may be owed on hedging agreements with counterparties subject to such laws and regulations and/or require that we accept equity interests in such counterparties in lieu of cash in satisfaction of such amounts), which we refer to collectively as \"Foreign Regulations\" which may apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such Foreign Regulations.  The Dodd-Frank Act, the rules which have been adopted and not vacated, and, to the extent that a Position Limit Rule is ultimately effected, such rule could significantly increase the cost of our derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of our derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to us that we have historically used to protect against risks that we encounter in our business, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. The Foreign Regulations could have similar effects. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations and Foreign Regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity contracts related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition, and our results of operations.. Tax laws and regulations may change over time, including the elimination of federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development.. Tax laws and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation, and the tax laws and regulations to which we are subject may change over time. Our tax filings are based upon our interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various jurisdictions at the time that the filings were made. If these laws or regulations change, or if the taxing authorities do not agree with our interpretation of the effects of such laws and regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.. On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law Public Law No. 115-97, a comprehensive tax reform bill commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") that significantly reforms the Code. The Tax Act, among other things, (i) permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate, (ii) repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax, (iii) eliminates the deduction for certain domestic production activities, (iv) imposes new limitations on the utilization of net operating losses, and (v) provides for more general changes to the taxation of corporations, including changes to cost recovery rules and to the deductibility of interest expense, which may impact the taxation of oil and gas companies. The Tax Act is complex and far-reaching and we cannot predict with certainty the resulting impact its enactment will have on us. The ultimate impact of the Tax Act may differ from our estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and any such changes in our interpretations or assumptions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.. 50. Table of Contents. In past years, legislation has been proposed that, if enacted into law, would make significant changes to U.S. federal and state income tax laws, including, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties; (ii) the elimination of current expensing of intangible drilling and development costs; and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. While these specific changes are not included in the Tax Act, no accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future or, if enacted, what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be. The elimination of such U.S. federal tax deductions, as well as any other changes to or the imposition of new federal, state, local or non-U.S. taxes (including the imposition of, or increases in production, severance or similar taxes) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations by increasing the after - tax costs we incur which would in turn make it uneconomic to drill some locations if commodity prices are not sufficiently high, resulting in lower revenues and decreases in production and reserves.. We are subject to anti - takeover provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, our Rights Plan and Delaware law that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.. Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us. These provisions may also frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management team. Furthermore, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits, with some exceptions, stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. In addition, the Company entered into the Rights Plan on July 28, 2015. The Rights Plan is designed to preserve stockholder value and the value of our NOLs by acting as a deterrent to any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock without the approval of our board of directors. Although not intended for this purpose, the Rights Plan has an anti-takeover effect. For more information on possible risks associated with our rights plan, please see \" - We adopted the Rights Plan, which though it was designed to preserve the value of our NOLs, may discourage the acquisition and sale of large blocks of our common stock and may result in significant dilution for certain stockholders.\"    Finally, our amended and restated bylaws establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings. Although we believe these provisions together provide an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer to acquire us may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.. We are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks.. We, including our officers and directors, are involved in various legal proceedings from time to time. Certain of these legal proceedings may be a significant distraction to management and could expose our Company to significant liability, including damages, fines, penalties and attorneys' fees and costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. For example, we recently settled or had dismissed, as applicable, derivative lawsuits initiated in 2013, which are discussed in more detail below in \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" and in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  -  Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies.\". We may have potential business conflicts of interest with members of the Sanchez Group regarding our past, ongoing and future relationships and the resolution of these conflicts may not be favorable to us.. Conflicts of interest may arise between members of the Sanchez Group and us in a number of areas relating to our past, ongoing and future relationships, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlabor, tax, employee benefit, indemnification and other matters arising under agreements with SOG;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\temployee recruiting and retention;. 51. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbusiness opportunities that may be attractive to both members of the Sanchez Group and us; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbusiness transactions that we enter into with members of the Sanchez Group.. We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and, even if we do so, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party.. Finally, in connection with our initial public offering (\"IPO\"), we entered into several agreements with members of the Sanchez Group. In addition, at the closing of the Comanche Acquisition, we entered into management services agreements with SOG for it to perform various management service functions for SN UnSub and Blackstone and/or their affiliates. These agreements were made in the context of a related party transaction. The terms of these agreements may be more or less favorable to us than if they had been negotiated with unaffiliated third parties.. Pursuant to the terms of our restated certificate of incorporation, members of the Sanchez Group are not required to offer corporate opportunities to us, and our directors and officers may be permitted to offer certain corporate opportunities to members of the Sanchez Group before us.. Our board of directors includes persons who are also directors and/or officers of members of the Sanchez Group. Our restated certificate of incorporation provides that:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmembers of the Sanchez Group are free to compete with us in any activity or line of business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe do not have any interest or expectancy in any business opportunity, transaction, or other matter in which members of the Sanchez Group engage or seek to engage merely because we engage in the same or similar lines of business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tto the fullest extent permitted by law, members of the Sanchez Group will have no duty to communicate their knowledge of, or offer, any potential business opportunity, transaction, or other matter to us, and members of the Sanchez Group are free to pursue or acquire such business opportunity, transaction, or other matter for themselves or direct the business opportunity, transaction, or other matter to its affiliates; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tif any director or officer of any member of the Sanchez Group who is also one of our officers or directors becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction, or other matter (other than one expressly offered to that director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer), that director or officer will have no duty to communicate or offer that business opportunity to us, and will be permitted to communicate or offer that business opportunity to such member of the Sanchez Group and that director or officer will not, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be deemed to have (1) breached or acted in a manner inconsistent with or opposed to his or her fiduciary or other duties to us regarding the business opportunity or (2) acted in bad faith or in a manner inconsistent with our best interests or those of our stockholders.. We depend on SOG to provide us with certain services for our business. The services that SOG provides to us may not be sufficient to meet our needs, and we may have difficulty finding replacement services or be required to pay increased costs to replace these services after our agreements with SOG expire.. Certain services required by us for the operation of our business, including general and administrative services, geological, geophysical and reserve engineering, lease and land administration, marketing, accounting, operational services, information technology services, compliance, insurance maintenance and management of outside professionals, are provided by SOG pursuant to the Services Agreement. The services provided under the Services Agreement commenced on the date that the IPO closed and had an initial term of five years. The term automatically extends for additional 12 - month periods and is terminable by either party at any time upon 180 days' written notice. See \"Corporate Governance - Compensation Committee\" in the proxy statement for the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders. While. 52. Table of Contents. these services are being provided to us by SOG, our operational flexibility to modify or implement changes with respect to such services or the amounts we pay for them is limited. After the expiration or termination of this agreement, we may not be able to replace these services or enter into appropriate third - party agreements on terms and conditions, including cost, comparable to those that we will receive from SOG under our agreements with SOG.. In addition, SOG may outsource some or all of these services to third parties, and a failure of all or part of SOG's relationships with its outsourcing providers could lead to delays in or interruptions of these services. Our reliance on SOG and others as service providers and on SOG's outsourcing relationships, and our limited ability to control certain costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Sector cost inflation could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget.. Our industry is cyclical and third party oilfield materials, service and supply costs are also subject to supply and demand dynamics. During periods of decreasing levels of industry exploration and production, such as occurred in 2015 and 2016, the demand for, and cost of, drilling rigs and oilfield services decreases. Conversely, during periods of increasing levels of industry activity, the demand for, and cost of, drilling rigs and oilfield services increase.. In the second half of 2016 and 2017, we witnessed a modest improvement in commodity prices. If this trend continues, and if the commodity price recovery is robust, we expect industry exploration and production activities to increase, resulting in higher demand for oilfield services and supplies, which could result in sector price inflation. In addition, the costs of such items could increase and their availability may become limited, particularly in basins of relatively higher activity.. A portion of our total outstanding shares is held by members of the Sanchez Group and may be sold into the market at any time. In addition, Blackstone and GSO (or their affiliates) received a substantial number of our securities in connection with the Comanche Acquisition. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.. As of February 23, 2018, members of the Sanchez Group owned, in the aggregate, approximately 14.2% of our outstanding common stock. These shares are generally eligible for resale in the public markets, subject to the volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, if then applicable. In addition, at the closing of the Comanche Acquisition, we issued approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock to GSO and warrants to purchase approximately 1.9 million and 6.5 million shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $10.00 per share, to GSO and three affiliates of Blackstone, respectively, resulting in GSO and such Blackstone affiliates owning approximately 4.6% and 7.7% of our common stock, respectively, assuming that the warrants were fully exercised as of February 23, 2018. Following the conclusion of a two-year lockup period, shares of common stock issued pursuant to these warrants will be eligible for resale in the public markets, subject to the volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, if then applicable. In addition, under certain circumstances, members of the Sanchez Group, GSO and such Blackstone affiliate have the right to require us to register the resale of their shares. Moreover, we have registered all of the shares of our common stock that we may issue under our employee benefit plans and there were an additional 8,251,002 shares available for future issuance to our directors, officers and employees as restricted stock or stock option awards pursuant to our Third Amended and Restated 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan (the \"LTIP\") as of December 31, 2017.  These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance unless, pursuant to their terms, these stock awards have transfer restrictions attached to them or are held by our affiliates, in which event such shares may be sold subject to the volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, if then applicable. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock."
