[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. Risks Related to Our Business. Our results of operations may fluctuate significantly based on a number of factors.. We deliver our Water - as - a - Service, or WAAS, solutions through two operating platforms: Seven Seas Water and Quench. Seven Seas Water is a multinational provider of desalination and wastewater treatment solutions, and Quench is a U.S. - based provider of Point - of - Use, or POU, filtered water systems and related services. For each of our. 16. business platforms, there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our operating results. For our Seven Seas Water business, these factors include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing of the commencement of any operations of new, expanded or acquired desalination or wastewater treatment plants;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe disposition, termination or expiration of or non-compliance with a water supply agreement for a desalination or wastewater treatment plant;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvariations in the volume or price of water purchased by our customers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing or delay of collections from a customer, including those arising from credit issues of the customer;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing, size and accounting treatment of acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe terms and timing of customer contract amendments (including those that result in changes to water rates);.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany disruptions or errors in the operations of our plants due to severe weather conditions or natural disasters, equipment failures, power outages, extended maintenance, or other factors, including environmental factors (such as bacteria levels or contaminants in source water) that can reduce our production volume;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in customer demand;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in demand due to fluctuations in rainfall levels, damage and repairs to our customers' infrastructure and water conservation efforts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in electricity rates, our ability to monitor and control our electric power usages, or both;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in patterns of tourism;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunforeseeable or unavoidable delays in large - scale and/or quick deploy development projects;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to enter into new markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to raise sufficient debt or equity capital to fund the construction or acquisition of new plants;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe activities of our competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to control expenses;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour inability to recruit and retain skilled labor and personnel changes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the political, social and economic conditions of our markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimitations imposed by environmental and other regulatory requirements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in our capital spending;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinformation technology systems or network infrastructure failure and cyber-attacks, which could result in loss of operational capacities or critical data or cause delays in our billing and collection cycles;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in inflation rates, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and. 17.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic conditions.. For our Quench business, these factors include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcustomer attrition;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe activities of our competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvariations in the timing of orders and installation of our systems;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe introduction and market acceptance of new products and new variations of existing products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisruption in our sources of supply;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpersonnel changes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinformation technology systems or network infrastructure failure and cyber-attacks, which could result in loss of operational capacities or critical data or cause delays in our billing and collection cycles;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to control expenses;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in our mix of products including changes in the mix of installed rental units and sold units, and the mix in the type of rental units installed; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in our ability to raise or spend capital.. Failure to retain certain key personnel or the inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could negatively impact our ability to operate or grow our business.. The success of our business will continue to depend to a significant extent on our ability to retain or attract key personnel, particularly management, engineering, sales and operating personnel. Our management team, led by our Chief Executive Officer, Douglas R. Brown, our President, Anthony Ibarguen, and our Chief Financial Officer, Lee S. Muller, and other key personnel have extensive industry experience. Our ability to attract or retain these employees will depend on our ability to offer competitive compensation, training and benefits. If we are unable to continue to hire and retain skilled management, technical, engineering, sales, service and operating personnel, we will have trouble operating and expanding our business, including developing and operating our existing and new or acquired desalination plants. Our success depends largely upon the continued service of our management, technical, engineering, sales, service and operating personnel and our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled personnel. We face significant competition for such personnel from other businesses and other organizations which may better be able to attract such personnel. The ability to attract or retain these employees will depend on our ability to offer competitive compensation, training and benefits. The loss of key personnel or our inability to hire and retain personnel who have the necessary management, technical, engineering, sales, service and operating backgrounds could materially adversely affect our business and our financial performance.. The future growth of our business is dependent on our ability to identify and successfully complete acquisitions for both our Seven Seas Water and Quench businesses and assets, and to operate any acquired assets or businesses profitably.. Acquisitions have historically been a major part of our expansion strategy, and we expect to continue to grow through acquisitions in the future. We expect to continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of businesses or products with the intention to expand our customer and revenue bases, widen our geographic coverage and increase our product breadth. As part of the expansion strategy for our Seven Seas Water business, we may seek to acquire additional desalination and water treatment facilities. Potential acquisition candidates include individual plants and businesses that operate multiple plants. For our Quench business, we may seek to acquire additional portfolios of equipment or businesses with local, regional, national or international customer bases. Identifying attractive acquisition candidates and. 18. willing sellers, particularly for our Seven Seas Water business, has been and continues to be challenging. We routinely evaluate potential acquisition candidates and engage in discussions and negotiations regarding potential acquisitions. There is significant competition for acquisition and expansion opportunities in our businesses. We compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with companies that have significantly greater financial and management resources. There can be no assurance that any of our discussions or negotiations will result in an acquisition. In addition, even if we have executed a definitive agreement for an acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will consummate the transaction within the anticipated closing timeframe, or at all.. The anticipated benefits from any of these potential acquisitions may not be achieved unless the operations of the acquired facilities, portfolios or businesses are successfully integrated in a timely manner. The integration of our acquisitions will require substantial attention from management and operating personnel to ensure that the acquisition does not disrupt any existing operations, or affect our customers' opinions and perceptions of our services, products or customer support.. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions depends, to a significant extent, on a number of factors, including the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe integration of the target businesses into our company;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe performance and development of the underlying assets, businesses, services or technologies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacceptance by our target's customers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe retention of key employees;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual, labor or other issues arising out of the acquisitions; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour correct assessment of assumed liabilities and the management of the relevant operations.. The process of integrating the various facilities, portfolios or businesses could cause the interruption of, or delays in, the activities of some or all of the existing facilities, portfolios or businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Acquisitions also place a burden on our information, financial and operating systems and our employees and management. Our ability to manage our growth effectively and integrate the operations of acquired facilities, portfolios or businesses, or newly expanded or developed facilities, will require us to continue to attract, train, motivate, manage and retain key employees and to expand our information technology, operational and financial systems. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may spend time and resources on such acquisitions that do not ultimately increase our profitability or that cause loss of, or harm to, relationships with employees, and customers as a result of the integration of new businesses.. Our Seven Seas Water business is dependent on a small group of customers for a significant amount of our revenue.. Our Seven Seas Water business focuses on large and complex projects. Consequently, we are dependent on a small number of customers for a significant amount of our revenue. Our desalination projects usually conduct business under long - term water supply agreements with one or a limited number of customers or a single government or quasi - government entity that purchase the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant facility's output over the term of the agreement. This customer concentration exposes us to increased risk of cancellation or breach of existing contracts or delay of new projects, which may cause high volatility of our revenues. For example, the aggregate of our five largest Seven Seas Water customers accounted for approximately 42% of AquaVenture Holding Limited's consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. While we intend to maintain long - term water supply agreements for each of our facilities, due to market conditions, regulatory regimes and other factors, it may be difficult for us to secure long - term agreements where our current contracts are expiring or for new development projects. In addition, the financial performance of our facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, our customers. If any significant customer ceases or delays payments to us, cancels or delays a project or otherwise ceases doing business with us, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Also, the failure of our customer in the BVI to pay us on a timely basis or at all could cause our BVI subsidiary to be in default on its debt, which could permit the lenders of that debt to accelerate its repayment. Further, if we are required to transfer or sell one or more of our desalination plants to our customers, our business, results of. 19. operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. While in certain cases we serve quasi - governmental agency customers, those water supply agreements are neither guaranteed by the related government nor supported by the full faith and credit of such government, and no assurance can be given that such government would provide financial support.. The future growth of our Seven Seas Water business is dependent on our ability to identify and secure new project opportunities in a competitive environment.. We are currently pursuing new opportunities for our Seven Seas Water business in North America, the Caribbean, South America, Africa and other select markets. Any new project we implement will require achievement of critical milestones in order to commence construction, the first of which is to successfully identify markets for such projects and secure contracts with proposed customers to sell water in sufficient quantities and at prices that make the projects financially viable.. Our Seven Seas Water business typically incurs significant business development expenses in the pursuit of new projects and markets, and such expenses have had, and could have, an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. We currently operate primarily in the Caribbean where we have successfully identified markets that accept our build, own and operate, or BOO, model. However, we expect to face challenges when we enter new markets, including identifying and establishing relationships with appropriate local partners, locating potential sites for new plants and convincing potential customers about the benefits of our BOO model. New markets may also have competitive conditions and governmental or regulatory regimes that are different from our existing markets. Any failure on our part to recognize or respond competitively to these differences may adversely affect the success of our business development efforts or operations in those markets, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.. In most cases, we must sign a contract and sometimes obtain, or renew, various licenses, permits and authorizations from regulatory authorities. The competition and/or negotiation process that must be followed to win such contracts is often long, costly, complex and hard to predict. The same applies to the permit authorization process for activities that may affect the environment, which are often preceded by increasingly complex studies and public investigation. We may invest significant resources in a project or public tender without obtaining the right to build the plant. This could arise for many reasons, including the failure to obtain necessary licenses, permits or authorizations or inability to respond competitively. As a result, it may increase the overall cost of our activities or, if the resulting costs were to become too high, it could potentially force us to abandon certain projects. Should such situations become more frequent, the scope and profitability of our business, growth rate, predictability of earnings and cash flow generation could be materially and adversely affected.. As part of the bidding process that must be followed to win contracts, we must, at times, share our know - how and confidential information with third parties. The need to share other confidential information and know - how increases the risk that such know - how and confidential information become known by our competitors, are incorporated into the product development of others or are disclosed or used in a way that disadvantages our business. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know - how and confidential information, a competitor's discovery of our know - how and confidential information or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business.. We may also decide to enter new markets by building reverse osmosis desalination plants before we have obtained a contract for the sale of water to be produced by the new plant or before we have established a customer base for the water to be produced by the new plant. Therefore, if we are unable to obtain a contract or sufficient number of customers for the plant, we may be unable to recover the cost of our investment in the plant, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.. A number of factors may prevent or delay our Seven Seas Water business from building new plants and expanding our existing plants, including our dependence on third - party suppliers and construction companies.. A number of factors may prevent or delay construction, expansion or deployment of our facilities, including our dependence on third - party suppliers of equipment and materials, our dependence on third - party construction companies, and the timing of equipment purchases.. 20. The equipment and materials required for the uninterrupted service of our Seven Seas Water plants are supplied by only a limited number of manufacturers and could only be replaced with difficulty or at significant added cost. Some materials or equipment may become scarce or difficult to obtain in the market, or they may increase in price. This could adversely affect the lead - time within which we receive the materials or components, and in turn affect our commitments to our customers, or could adversely affect the material cost or quality. The failure of any of these suppliers to fulfill their obligations to us or our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Consequently, the financial performance of our facilities is dependent in part on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, our suppliers.. We also engage in long - term engineering, procurement and construction contracts associated with developing our new projects. If a construction company we have hired to build a new project defaults or fails to fulfill its contractual obligations, we could face significant delays and cost overruns. Any construction delays could have a material adverse impact on us.. In addition, the timing of equipment purchases can pose financial risks to us. We attempt to make purchases of equipment and/or material as needed. However, from time to time, there may be excess demand for certain types of equipment with substantial delays between the time we place orders and receive delivery. In those instances, to avoid construction delays or service disruptions associated with the inability to own and place such equipment and/or materials into service when needed, we may place orders well in advance of deployment or when actual damage to the equipment and/or materials occurs. Thus, there is a risk that at the time of delivery of such equipment or materials, there may not yet be a need to use them; however, we are still required to accept delivery and make payment. In addition, due to the customization of some of our equipment and/or materials, there may be a limited market for resale of such equipment or material. This can result in our having to incur material equipment and/or material costs, with no use for or ability to resell such equipment.. Our ability to meet customer needs is dependent on the successful and efficient operation of our Seven Seas Water desalination facilities, which can be adversely impacted by a number of factors.. Our ability to meet our customers' needs, as well as achieve our targeted level of financial performance, depends on the successful operation of our facilities in our Seven Seas Water business. We currently own and operate ten water treatment facilities in the Caribbean region and South America, which generated substantially all of the revenue of our Seven Seas Water business for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Some of these facilities serve governmental and municipal customers which provide water to the ultimate consumers. If these customers fail to provide adequate service, our reputation will suffer, and our competitive position may be impaired. In addition, if the risks involved in our operations are not appropriately managed or mitigated, our operations may not be successful, and this could adversely affect our results of operations. The continued operation and maintenance of our desalination facilities may be disrupted by a number of technical problems, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbreakdown or failure of equipment or processes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontamination of, or other problems with, the raw feedwater that we process, including from environmental factors (such as bacteria levels or contaminants in source water) that can reduce our production volumes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tservice disruptions, stoppages or variations in our supply of electricity transmitted by third parties to our desalination plants resulting in service interruptions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tavailability of materials used in the desalination process;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproblems with, or delays in availability of, water distribution infrastructure or our customers' ability to take delivery of the water we produce;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toperating hazards such as mechanical problems and accidents caused by human error, which could impact public safety, reliability and customer confidence;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisruption in the functioning of our information technology and network infrastructure which are vulnerable to disability, failures and unauthorized access;. 21.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnatural disasters, hurricanes, floods and other extreme weather;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability to secure and retain qualified labor; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother unanticipated operational and maintenance liabilities and expenses.. If we do not operate our business to appropriately manage or mitigate these problems, we may breach our water supply agreement, harm our customer relationships or both, which could lead to the termination of the related water supply agreement. A decrease in, or the elimination of, the revenues generated by our key plants or a substantial increase in the costs of operating such plants could materially impact our reputation, performance, financial results and financial condition.. Our negotiations of changes to existing customer contracts may not be successful and may adversely affect our business and results of operations.. Our Seven Seas Water business is generally conducted in accordance with the terms of long-term water supply contracts that, among other things, may provide for minimum customer purchases, guaranteed supply volumes and specified levels of pricing based on the volume of water purchased during the billing period. These contractual features are key determinants of plant revenue and plant profitability. Certain of our contracts provide for contractually scheduled price changes. In addition, most of our contracts include provisions to increase prices in accordance with a specified inflation index such as the consumer price index. Following the completion of acquisitions, we are typically bound by the contracts we acquire, which may include terms that either we or our customer might desire to change. From time to time, we also negotiate pricing or other changes with our existing customers which include, but are not limited to, extending or renewing a contract, expanding plant capacity, adjusting minimum volumes pursuant to a take-or-pay agreement, adjusting water rates or the indexation thereof, or a combination thereof. We have recently entered into, or proposed to enter into, amendments to certain of our contracts that have resulted in reductions or delays in the revenues we derive from those contracts in exchange for changes we believe are beneficial to us in the long run. As our customers are often governmental entities or affiliates, these negotiations can take considerable time and effort, and in certain situations, proposed amendments may require the approval of certain of governmental or quasi-governmental parties, our lenders or other third parties, resulting in negotiations with multiple parties. There can be no assurances that any specific negotiations will result in an amendment on a timely basis or at all, or that such amendment will be beneficial to us. The terms and timing of any such amendments may negatively impact our operating results, fail to meet our expectations or result in greater variability in our operating results from period to period. Failure to successfully conclude any such negotiations may require us to update previous public statements regarding our expected financial results, adversely affect our relationship with our customer, which could result in our customer exercising its rights under the contract (including, in certain circumstances, the right to purchase the desalination plant), or result in negative publicity, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Because we are dependent on a small number of customers for a significant amount of our Seven Seas Water revenues, any significant changes in prices or other terms of our contracts with any of those customers could significantly reduce our revenues, operating results and cash flows in specific periods or for the long term. Further, the political, economic and social conditions prevailing from time to time may lead our customers to more aggressively pursue cost reduction initiatives and contract amendments, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and operating results.. If our Quench business experiences a higher annual unit attrition rate than forecasted, our revenues could decline and our costs could increase, which would reduce our profits and increase the need for additional funding.. Attrition is generally the result of competitive offerings, customers' ceasing or reducing their use of filtered water service, customer financial distress, customer dissatisfaction and other factors. If our unit attrition rate is higher than expected, it would reduce our revenues and could require increased marketing costs to attract the replacement customers required to sustain our growth plan, both of which would reduce our profits and profit margins. In addition, our ability to generate positive operating cash flow in future periods will be dependent on our ability to obtain additional funding to increase our customer acquisition activities to out - pace customer attrition and absorb operating expenses. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding, increase our customer base at a rate in excess of our customer attrition rate or achieve positive operating cash flows in future periods. In the absence of our raising additional funding to finance increased selling and marketing activities and new customer acquisition, our customer attrition may exceed the rate at which we can replace such customers' business. In such case, our revenues could be reduced and our profit margin could be affected.. 22. Increased competition could hurt our Quench business.. The water cooler markets in the United States and Canada are intensely competitive. The POU filtration market is highly fragmented, with many small, local service providers. There are also a number of larger national competitors, including DS Services (a subsidiary of Cott Corporation), which offers BWC, office coffee service, or OCS, and POU services; Nestle, which offers BWC and POU services; Aramark, Compass Water Solutions, Waterlogic International and Pure Health Solutions, Inc. which offer OCS and POU services. Municipal tap water is also a substitute for our POU filtration services. Our competitive position is based on our pricing, national service coverage and product quality. Many of these larger businesses have substantially greater financial and management resources than we do. Our ability to gain or maintain market share may be limited as a result of actions by competitors. If we do not succeed in effectively differentiating ourselves from our competitors, based on pricing, service, value proposition, quality of products, desirability of brands or otherwise, our competitive position may be weakened, which could also jeopardize our strategy to include the rental of additional or upgraded water coolers and the rental of equipment from our product lines enabled by POU water filtration. If we are unable to convince current and potential customers of the advantages of our services, our ability to sell our services may be limited.. Certain of our long - term water supply contracts under our Seven Seas Water business require us to transfer ownership of the desalination plant to the customer upon expiration or termination of the contract, or permit the customer to purchase the desalination plant in accordance with the contract before the expiration or termination of the contract.. Approximately 40% of our long - term water supply contracts under our Seven Seas Water business require us to transfer ownership of the desalination plant to the customer upon expiration or termination of the supply contract, either for a specified amount or for no additional payment. Some of our long - term water supply contracts permit the customer to purchase the plant for amounts determined in accordance with the contract before the expiration or termination of the contract, typically with notice of six months or less. In addition, most of our long - term water supply contracts grant us the right to remove our equipment from the site of the facility in the event that the contract terminates due to a default by the customer or otherwise. If we are required to transfer or sell a desalination plant to our customer or are unable to remove our equipment upon termination of the contract for whatever reason, including customer interference, our revenue, earnings and cash flows from that desalination plant will cease, unless we are retained by the customer to continue to operate and maintain the plant. There can be no assurances that we will be retained by a customer to continue to operate and maintain the plant after its transfer to or purchase by such customer. As a result, our revenue, earnings and cash flows would decrease materially if we were to be required to transfer or sell a desalination plant. In addition, if we are required to transfer or sell a desalination plant to a customer for less than our carrying value of the plant or no consideration, we may not recoup our investment in the plant, may not receive sufficient proceeds to enable the subsidiary that owns the plant to repay any outstanding project finance debt in full, and may have to write down or write off the remaining value of the plant, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, assets, earnings and debt covenant compliance. See \"Business - Seven Seas Water - Our Desalination Plants.\". The political, economic and social conditions impacting our geographic markets may adversely affect our Seven Seas Water business.. Currently, substantially all of our operating desalination plants are located in the Caribbean region. We often market our services, and sell the water we produce, to governments and governmental entities run by elected or politically appointed officials. Various constituencies, including our competitors, existing suppliers, local investors, developers, environmental groups and conservation groups, have competing agendas with respect to the development of desalination plants and sale of water in the areas in which we operate, which means that decisions affecting our business are based on many factors other than economic and business considerations.. Political concerns and governmental procedures and policies have hindered or delayed, and in the future are expected to hinder or delay, our ability to develop desalination plants or to enter into, amend or renew water supply contracts. We cannot predict whether changes in political administrations will result in changes in governmental policy and whether such changes will affect our business. For example, our market development activities and operations can be adversely affected by lengthy government bidding, contracting, licensing, permitting, approval and procurement processes, immigration or work permit restrictions, local laws, restrictive exchange controls or other factors that limit our customers' access to U.S. dollars and nationalization or expropriation of property. In addition, we may need to spend. 23. significant time and resources to inform newly elected officials, local authorities and others about the benefits of outsourced management of desalination plants and other water and wastewater treatment infrastructure.. Our customers may suffer significant financial difficulties, including those due to downturns in the economy, political developments, severe weather events (such as hurricanes) or commodity price fluctuations. Some of our customers could be unable to pay amounts owed to us or renew contracts with us at current or increased rates, which would negatively affect our financial performance. Certain of the customers and governments that we serve derive significant revenue from tourism, the sale of certain commodities such as oil, petrochemicals, natural gas, precious metals and other minerals, and our customers may be adversely impacted if demand or prices for these commodities were to decline for a prolonged period. Therefore, a decline in international or regional demand or prices for certain commodities may indirectly impact the demand for the water we produce and the credit worthiness of our customers.. Furthermore, many of our targeted markets are in developing countries undergoing rapid and unpredictable economic and social changes. Many of these countries have suffered significant political, economic and social crises in the past, and these events may occur again in the future. Adverse political, economic and social conditions may affect existing operations and the development of new operations due to the resulting political economic and social changes, the inability to accurately assess the demand for water and the inability to begin operations as scheduled.. We expect to continue to be subject to risks associated with dealing with governments and governmental entities, and political concerns and governmental procedures and policies may hinder or delay our ability to enter into supply agreements or develop our plants. The political, economic and social conditions impacting our geographic markets may adversely affect our business.. Severe weather conditions or natural or man - made disasters may disrupt our operations and affect the demand for water produced by our Seven Seas Water business or ability to produce water, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. Our Seven Seas Water business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by severe weather, floods, natural disasters (such as hurricanes, particularly in the Caribbean), hazards (such as fire, explosion, collapse or machinery failure), environmental factors, or be the target of terrorist or other deliberate attacks. Repercussions of these catastrophic events may include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshutting down or curtailing the operation of our plants for limited or extended periods;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in short-term customer demand;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe need to obtain necessary equipment or supplies, including electricity, which may not be available to us in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tevacuation of and/or injury to personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdamage or catastrophic loss to our equipment, facilities and project work sites, resulting in suspension of operations or delays in building or maintaining our plants;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of productivity;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe deterioration of the financial health of our customers; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinterruption to any projects that we may have in process.. Large - scale or repetitive natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods or earthquakes, can also lead to the damage or destruction of certain infrastructure (such as electricity supply, water storage tanks, water distribution infrastructure, roads and means of communication) on which we depend for the conduct of our business and can cause damage to the infrastructure for which we are responsible.. 24. In addition, hazards (such as fire, explosion, collapse or machinery failure) are inherent risks in our operations, which may occur as a result of inadequate internal processes, technological flaws, human error or certain events beyond our control. Our Seven Seas Water facilities could also be the target of terrorist or other deliberate attacks which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We maintain security measures at our facilities, and we have and will continue to bear increases in costs for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations, and supplies. Despite our security measures, we may not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events, or other attacks on our facilities, should they occur. Such an event could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.. Any contamination resulting from a natural or man - made disaster to our raw feedwater supply may result in disruption in our services, additional costs and litigation, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Damage or destruction to our facilities and infrastructure could temporarily inhibit our ability to deliver water as required by our contracts, which may enable our customers to terminate such contracts.. We may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured.. We may from time to time become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. Because of the location of our Seven Seas Water facilities, we are exposed to risks posed by severe weather and other natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods and earthquakes. In addition to natural risks, hazards (such as fire, explosion, collapse or machinery failure) are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as a result of inadequate internal processes, technological flaws, human error or certain events beyond our control. The hazards described above can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any of these events may result in our being subject to investigation, required to perform remediation and/or named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, environmental cleanup costs, personal injury, natural resource damages and fines and/or penalties. In addition, such events may affect the availability of personnel, proper functioning of our information technology infrastructure and availability of third parties on whom we rely, any of which consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. Our facility in Tortola and our facilities in the U.S. Virgin Islands which serve VIWAPA are insured against earthquake, flood and hurricane damage, while our other facilities are not. Our facility in Trinidad is insured against earthquake. Our insurance programs have varying coverage limits, exclusions and maximums, and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make. Each policy includes deductibles or self - insured retentions and policy limits for covered claims. As a result, we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured. Catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, increased premium costs or deductibles with respect to the insurance policies covering these facilities.. Our facilities are fortified to withstand damage caused by severe weather, and we have not experienced any material loss or damage resulting from the natural disasters that have impacted our facilities. However, we cannot assure that our facilities will withstand all natural disasters in the future, and an unforeseen natural disaster may cause damage to or the destruction of one or more of our facilities. In addition, an accident or safety incident could expose us to significant liability and a public perception that our operations are unsafe or unreliable. Although we conduct ongoing, comprehensive safety programs, a major accident could expose us to significant personal injury or property claims by third parties or employees. Even if we have purchased insurance, the adverse impact on our business, including both costs and lost revenue, could greatly exceed the amounts, if any, that we might recover from our insurers. We could also suffer significant construction delays or substantial fluctuations in the pricing or availability of materials for any projects we have in process. Any of these events could cause a decrease in our revenue, cash flow and earnings.. In our Quench business, we maintain liability insurance covering our facilities and assets, including our company - owned equipment installed in the field, which could fail and cause significant property damage, personal injury and/or loss of life. We also maintain cyber and privacy liability coverage for risks related to our network and related data. However, we can make no assurance that the adverse impact of any claim will not materially exceed the amounts that we might recover from our customers, suppliers or insurers. Moreover, significant insurance claims, even if covered, can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, increased premium costs or deductibles. Any of these events could adversely affect our operations.. 25. Our Seven Seas Water operations may be affected by tourism and seasonal fluctuations which could affect the demand for our water.. Our operations may be affected by the levels of tourism and seasonal variations in the areas in which we operate. Demand for our water can be affected by variations in the level of tourism, demand for real estate and rainfall levels. Tourism in our service areas is affected by the economies of the tourists' home countries (primarily the United States and Europe), severe weather events (such as hurricanes), terrorist activity and perceived threats thereof, the cruise industry and costs of fuel and airfares. A downturn in tourism or greater than expected rainfall in the locations we serve could adversely affect our revenues, cash flows and results of operations.. Quench's largest customers account for a significant percentage of Quench's revenues, and our business would be harmed were we to lose these customers.. We estimate Quench's twenty largest customers accounted for approximately 10% of the revenue of our Quench business during the year ended December 31, 2017. A material reduction in purchases by, or services provided to, these customers could have a significant adverse effect on the business and operating results of our Quench business. In addition, pressures by these customers that would cause us to materially reduce the price of our products could result in a reduction to our operating margins.. Certain of our water supply contracts do not contain \"take - or - pay\" obligations, which may adversely affect Seven Seas Water's financial position and results of operation.. Our water supply contracts may require customers to purchase a minimum volume of water on a take - or - pay basis over the term of those contracts. Take - or - pay provisions allow us to protect against short - term demand risk by guaranteeing minimum payments from such customers regardless of their actual requirements. However, two of our ten water supply contracts do not contain such provisions, and therefore, periods of low production requirements by our customers under such contracts may adversely affect our financial position and results of operation.. Our ability to compete successfully for acquisition opportunities and otherwise implement successfully our expansion strategy depends, in part, on the availability of sufficient cash resources, including proceeds from debt and equity financings.. Our ability to compete successfully for acquisition opportunities and otherwise implement successfully our expansion strategy depends, in part, on the availability of sufficient cash resources, including proceeds from debt and equity financings. Our growth strategies include developing projects, the success of which depends on our ability to find new sites suitable for development into viable projects and developing those sites and projects. Any new project development or expansion project requires us to invest substantial capital. We finance some of our projects with borrowings, which are repaid in part from the project's revenues, and secured by the share capital, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of that project subsidiary and by us. This type of financing is usually referred to as project financing. Commercial lending institutions sometimes refuse to provide project financing in certain less developed countries, and in these situations, we have sought and will continue to seek direct or indirect (through credit support or guarantees) project financing from a limited number of multilateral or bilateral international financial institutions or agencies. As a precondition to making such project financing available, the lending institutions may also require governmental guarantees of certain project and sovereign related risks. We may also acquire companies that benefit from these protections. There can be no assurance, however, that project financing from international financial agencies or that governmental guarantees will be available when needed, and if they are not, we may have to abandon the project or invest more of our own funds, which may not be in line with our investment objectives and would leave fewer funds for other projects and needs.. If the demand for our products and services declines when we are raising capital, we may not realize the expected benefits from our new facility or expansion project. Furthermore, our new or modified facilities may not operate at designed capacity or may cost more to operate than we expect. The inability to complete any new project development or expansion projects or to complete them on a timely basis and in turn grow our business could adversely affect our business and results of operations.. We believe that our future capital requirements will depend upon a number of factors, including cash generated from operations and the rate at which we acquire additional facilities, portfolios or businesses. We expect to fund such. 26. capital expenditures with cash from operations and proceeds from debt and equity financings. However, we may be unable to raise capital or may be unable to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.. Financing risk has also increased as a result of the deterioration of the global economy and the recent crisis in the financial markets and, as a result, we may forgo certain development opportunities. We believe that capitalized costs for projects under development are recoverable; however, there can be no assurance that any individual project will be completed and reach commercial operation. If these development efforts are not successful, we may abandon a project under development and write off the costs incurred in connection with such project. At the time of abandonment, we would expense all capitalized development costs incurred in connection therewith and could incur additional losses associated with any related contingent liabilities.. Our substantial indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquidity needs.. Our ability to comply with the terms of the documents governing our outstanding indebtedness, to make cash payments with respect to the outstanding indebtedness or to refinance any of such obligations will depend on our future performance, which in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial and many other factors beyond our control.. The terms of the documents governing our outstanding indebtedness contain a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, prepay subordinated debt, dispose of certain assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, create liens, make capital expenditures and make certain payments, investments or acquisitions and otherwise restrict corporate activities. In addition, we are required to satisfy specified financial covenants. Our ability to comply with such provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under some or all of the documents governing our outstanding indebtedness. In the event of any such default, depending on the actions taken by the lenders under our outstanding indebtedness, such lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed under such indebtedness, together with accrued interest, to be due and payable. Certain of our loans have cross - default provisions that may be triggered upon our default under the documents governing our other indebtedness and, in addition, a default may restrict our ability to effect intercompany transfers of funds.. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $174.3 million of outstanding consolidated indebtedness. Although our cash flow from operations has been sufficient to meet our debt service obligations in the past, there can be no assurance that our operating results will continue to be sufficient for us to meet our debt service obligations and financial covenants. Certain of our outstanding indebtedness is collateralized by our assets, including the share capital of certain of our subsidiaries, and certain assets of our subsidiaries. If we were unable to repay borrowings, the lenders could proceed against their collateral. If the lenders or the holders of any other secured indebtedness were to foreclose on the collateral securing our obligations to them, there could be insufficient assets required for the continued operation of our business remaining after satisfaction in full of all such indebtedness. In addition, the loan instruments governing the indebtedness of certain of our subsidiaries contain certain restrictive covenants which limit the payment of dividends and distributions and the transfer of assets to us and require such subsidiaries to satisfy specific financial covenants.. The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to the holders of our shares, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital, payment of dividends or general corporate purposes may be impaired in the future;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe impact of negative pledges and financial covenants on our financial profile;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta substantial portion of our cash flow from operations may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for our future growth, operations and other purposes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcertain of our borrowings are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest, which exposes us to the risk of increased interest costs; and. 27.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be substantially more leveraged and at higher costs than certain of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage and make us more vulnerable to changing market conditions and regulations.. We have significant cash requirements and limited sources of liquidity.. We require cash primarily to fund:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdebt service obligations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconstruction and other project commitments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tequipment purchases;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trefurbishment, enhancement and improvements of existing facilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother capital commitments, including business development investments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttaxes; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tselling and marketing and other overhead costs.. Our principal sources of liquidity are:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdebt and equity financing;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tintercompany receivables;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trepayment of principal and interest on intercompany loans; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproceeds from debt financings at the subsidiary level.. While we believe that these sources will be adequate to meet our obligations for the foreseeable future, this belief is based on a number of material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital or commercial lending markets, the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, exchange rates, our ability to sell assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or repay intercompany loans. Any number of assumptions could prove to be incorrect and therefore there can be no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than expected. In addition, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay at maturity the entire principal outstanding of indebtedness, and we may have to refinance such obligations. We have a  significant principal repayment due in 2021. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all, and any of these events could have a material effect on us.. As a part of our growth strategy, we have used, and expect to continue to use, project financing, which may adversely affect our financial results.. We sometimes rely on project financing to fund the costs of our acquisitions and project development. Our subsidiaries have incurred, and in the future, may incur, project financing indebtedness to the extent permitted by existing agreements, and may continue to do so to fund ongoing operations. In addition, we may acquire companies that have significant existing project financing indebtedness. Any such newly incurred subsidiary indebtedness would be. 28. added to our current consolidated debt levels. Our project financing debt is, and would likely be structurally senior to certain of our other debt, which could also intensify the risks associated with leverage. Separately, failure to obtain project financing could result in delay or cancellation of future transactions or projects, thus limiting our growth and future cash flows.. While the lenders to a project subsidiary under our project financings sometimes do not have direct recourse against us (other than to the extent we give any credit support), defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for us, including, without limitation:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour failure to receive subsidiary dividends, fees, interest payments, repayment of intercompany loans and other sources of cash, as the project subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to us during the pendency of any default;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttriggering our obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support which we have provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcausing us to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttriggering defaults or acceleration on our outstanding debt, and, in some cases, triggering cross - default provisions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe loss or impairment of investor confidence;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforeclosure on the assets that are pledged under the non - recourse loans, therefore by eliminating any and all potential future benefits derived from those assets; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour repayment of such project financing from other resources that do not secure that financing in an effort to avoid the adverse consequences of a default or acceleration of such project financing.. Future revenue for our long - term water supply agreements under our Seven Seas Water business is based on certain estimates and assumptions, and the actual results may differ materially from such estimated operating results.. We operate our Seven Seas Water business based on our current estimate of the revenues we will generate under our long - term water supply agreements. Many of the costs of operating our facilities are fixed or do not vary materially based on the water produced by the facility, particularly in the short term. Our estimates and assumptions regarding what the water facilities will produce, and the revenues it will generate, during a specific period may not materialize. Unanticipated events may cause unforeseeable downtime, which would cause us to be unable to deliver water to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the actual results achieved by us during the periods to which these estimates relate. If revenues generated by the facility are less than estimated, our operating profit, gross margin and profits will be adversely affected.. Our emergency response services under our Seven Seas Water business expose us to additional challenges and risks.. Our Seven Seas Water business also provides emergency response services in the event of a water crisis caused by water shortages, the failure of existing water producing equipment, and hurricanes or other natural disasters, among other reasons. We build skids, mobile desalination plants and other components in advance of a need to deploy them. To address these situations, we typically install our containerized mobile desalination plants pursuant to water supply agreements with shorter terms, typically with terms of less than five years. Due to the reactive nature of this market, we cannot predict when we will deploy our equipment, if at all, the duration of the deployment or the other terms and conditions applicable to the deployment (including the prices we will be paid for the water purchased from us). Our inability to deploy our containerized mobile desalination plants and components in a timely manner could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Further, we rely on our ability to use this equipment in other situations. If our equipment is damaged or requires extensive refurbishing after decommissioning and before it can be redeployed, our return on the investment in that equipment may be adversely affected. If we fail to perform in an emergency as our customer expects, or if our customer perceives that we failed to perform, our reputation and business could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the deployment of our equipment on a large scale in response to. 29. an emergency may divert management's attention and resources. This could reduce our ability to pursue other opportunities, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. The profitability of our Seven Seas Water facilities is dependent upon our ability to estimate costs accurately and acquire, construct and operate plants within budget.. The cost estimates we prepare in connection with the acquisition, construction and operation of our plants are subject to inherent uncertainties. Any acquisition, construction and operating costs for our plants that significantly exceed our initial estimates could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Any delay in the construction of the plant may result in additional costs, and future operational costs could be affected by a variety of factors, including lower than anticipated production efficiencies and hydrological conditions at the plant site that differ materially from those we expected.. We must satisfy each customer's specifications under our contracts, which may require additional processing steps or additional capital expenditures in order to meet such specifications. The terms of our water supply contracts typically require us to supply water for a specified price per unit during the term of the contract, subject to certain annual inflation adjustments, and to assume the risk that the costs associated with producing this water may be greater than anticipated. Because we base our contracted price of water in part on our estimation of future construction and operating costs, the profitability of our plants is dependent on our ability to estimate these costs accurately and remain within budget during the construction and operation of the facilities. In addition, most of our customers are required to supply the electricity we need to operate our desalination plants either for free or at contracted prices under their contracts with us. We will incur additional operating cost if we are required to bear the risks of fluctuations in electricity costs in the future, which may adversely and materially affect our results of operations and cash flows.. The cost of equipment, materials and services to build a plant may increase significantly after we submit our bid for, or begin construction of, a plant, which could cause the gross profit and net return on investment for the plant to be less than we anticipated. The profit margins we initially expect to generate from a plant could be further reduced if future operating costs for that plant exceed our estimates of such costs.. Failure to comply with laws, regulations and policies, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other applicable anti - corruption legislation, could result in fines, criminal penalties and an adverse effect on our business.. We are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non - U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including laws related to anti - corruption, export and import compliance, anti - trust and money laundering, due to our global operations. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti - bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. There has been an increase in anti - bribery law enforcement activity in recent years, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice, or DOJ, and the SEC, increased enforcement activity by non - U.S. regulators, and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti - bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti - bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from improper conduct of our employees or business partners. If we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable laws, including anti - corruption laws, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. Any such violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and might adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business.. Fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 57% of our outstanding debt was exposed to interest rate fluctuations. We have not entered into arrangements or contracts with third parties that constitute an interest rate hedge. The portion of our debt that bears interest at a fixed rate will vary from time to time. If interest rates significantly deviate from historical ranges, or if volatility or distribution of these changes. 30. deviates from historical norms, we may experience significant losses or defaults. As a result, fluctuating interest rates may negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.. Our inability to negotiate pricing terms in U.S. dollars may adversely impact our Seven Seas Water business, financial condition and results of operations.. Most of our Seven Seas Water revenue is generated and most of our operations are conducted in developing countries. Currently, customer payment obligations under substantially all of our water supply contracts are denominated in the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other foreign currencies, some of our component suppliers may increase the price they charge for their components in order to maintain an equivalent profit margin. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to negotiate U.S. dollar denominated pricing terms in the renewal of existing contracts or new contracts in the future. In certain situations, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk to the extent we have payment obligations in a local currency relating to labor, construction, consumable or materials costs or, of our procurement orders that are denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars. We have not entered into any arrangements or contracts with third parties to hedge against foreign exchange risk. If any of these local currencies change in value relative to the U.S. dollar, our cost in U.S. dollars would change accordingly, which could adversely affect our results of operations.. Our business and ability to enforce our rights under agreements relating to our Seven Seas Water business may be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatory regimes in the jurisdictions in which we operate.. Changes in laws governing capital controls, the liquidity of bank accounts or the repatriation of capital, repayment of intercompany loans and dividends could prevent or inhibit our receipt of cash from our foreign subsidiaries, resulting in longer payment cycles or impairment of our collection of accounts receivable. Although we may have legal recourse to enforce our rights under agreements to which we are a party and recover damages for breaches of those agreements, such legal proceedings are costly and may not be successful or resolved in a timely manner, and such resolution may not be enforced. Areas in which we may be affected include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforced renegotiation or modification of concessions, purchase agreements, land lease agreements and supply agreements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttermination of permits or concessions and compensation upon any such termination; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthreatened withdrawal of countries from international arbitration conventions.. Any of these factors may cause our costs to build, own, operate or maintain our desalination plants to increase, may delay the commissioning of such plants, and may delay the time when we receive revenue and cash flows from such plants.. Operational and execution risks may adversely impact the financial results of our Quench business.. Our operating results are reliant on the continued operation of our filtered water systems as well as our delivery fleet. Inherent in our operations are risks that require oversight and control, such as risks related to mechanical or electrical failure, fire, explosion, leaks, chemical use, and vehicle, lift or forklift accidents. We have established policies, procedures and safety protocols requiring ongoing training, oversight and control in an effort to address these risks. However, significant operating failures on our customers' premises or vehicle accidents could result in personal injury or loss of life, loss of distribution capabilities, and/or damage at the site of the filtered water system, thereby adversely impacting our business, reputation and financial results. These factors could subject us to lost sales, litigation contingencies and reputational risk.. Our multi - year contracts under our business may limit our ability to quickly and effectively react to general economic changes.. The conditions under which we initially enter into a contract may change over time. These changes may vary in nature or foreseeability and may result in adverse economic consequences. These consequences may be exacerbated by the multi - year terms of our contracts, which may hinder our ability to react rapidly and appropriately to changes. For example, we may not be free to adapt our pricing in line with changes in cost or demand. We also are not typically able. 31. to suddenly or unilaterally terminate a contract we believe is unprofitable or change its terms. The inability to react to changes, or terminate or change unprofitable contracts could materially affect our business.. Changes in demand for our Quench products and services may affect operating results.. We believe that the growth of the U.S. and Canadian water cooler markets is due, in part, to consumer preferences for healthy products and consumer taste preferences for treated water over tap water and other beverages. Growth is also affected by the demand from our customers, whose tastes and preferences may be affected by energy efficiency standards and environmental concerns, as well as the form, features and aesthetics of our equipment, among other factors. To the extent such preferences change, demand for our products will be affected, which may materially adversely affect us.. In our Quench business, we face the risk that our customers may fail to properly maintain, use and safeguard our equipment, which may negatively affect us as the providers of the systems.. It is generally our responsibility to service our Quench filtered water systems throughout the duration of the contract, and our customers are generally required to maintain insurance covering loss, damage or injury caused by our equipment. However, we are not able to monitor our customers' use or maintenance of their filtered water systems or their compliance with our contracts or usage instructions. A customer's failure to properly use, maintain or safeguard the filtered water system or the customer's non - compliance with insurance requirements may reflect poorly on us as the provider of the filtered water system and, as a result, damage our reputation. In addition, our Quench filtered water systems must be connected to a potable water source in order to be effective. A customer's failure or inability to connect our filter water system to a potable water source may reflect poorly on us as the provider of the filtered water system and, as a result, damage our reputation or cause the customer to terminate its relationship with us.. Many of our Seven Seas Water facilities are located on properties owned by others. If our landlords restrict our access to those properties or damage our facilities or equipment, our ability to develop, operate, maintain and remove our equipment would be adversely affected.. Most of our Seven Seas Water facilities are located on property owned by others, some of whom are our customers. Our rights to locate our facilities and equipment on, and to access, those properties are governed by contracts with the applicable landlords. We need access to those properties to develop, operate and maintain our facilities and equipment and, in certain cases, to remove our equipment at the end of a contract term. In certain situations, personnel having access to those properties need security and other clearances. If the landlord restricts our ability to access our facilities, our ability to develop, operate, maintain and remove our equipment, our business would be adversely affected. We cannot guarantee that we will not encounter labor disputes (strikes, walkouts, blocking access to sites, or the destruction of property in extreme cases), including those relating to our landlord's employees, that could interrupt our operations over a significant period of time. In addition, our personnel, facilities and equipment located on those properties may be harmed by other activities or events occurring on those properties, including being subject to personal injury or death, or damage. Any such restrictions or occurrences could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.. We rely on information technology and network infrastructure in areas of our operations, and a disruption relating to such technology or infrastructure could harm our business.. Seven Seas Water relies on our information technology and network infrastructure for both operations in our headquarters as well as our facilities, where our information technology and network infrastructure are critical for monitoring plant availability and efficiency. If our information technology or network infrastructure were to fail, such failure could lead to an inability to monitor our plant activities, and therefore could lead to noncompliance with health, safety and environmental requirements as well as increased costs and potential losses. Any increase in costs or losses could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the operation of our facilities relies on internet - based control systems. Interruption in internet service could limit or eliminate our ability to continue our plant operations, which would have a negative effect on our revenues.. Quench relies on our information technology and network infrastructure for field service, customer service, billing, equipment service, inventory control, fixed asset management, financial reporting, accounting, accounts payable, payroll, lead generation, call center operations, sales analysis, vehicle tracking and profitability reporting. Our systems. 32. are designed to enable us to track the locations of our installed POU units and ensure customer compliance with payment obligations in connection with such POU units. Any failure or disruption relating to this technology or infrastructure could seriously harm our operations and/or reduce profitability. In addition, we are in the midst of upgrading and enhancing our capabilities, including the replacement of our primary information technology systems. A failure to successfully implement such changes could adversely impact our business and may result in an inability to remain competitive with respect to our service offerings, pricing and collections.. Failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks, including information relating to our service providers, customers and employees, could adversely affect us.. We are dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and, in the normal course of our business, we collect and retain certain information pertaining to our service providers, customers and employees, including credit card information for certain of our customers. In addition, the operation of our facilities relies on internet - based control systems. If security breaches in connection with the delivery of our solutions allow unauthorized third parties to access any of this data or obtain control of our customers' systems or the systems controlling our plant operations, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.. The legal, regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security, privacy and credit card fraud is constantly evolving and companies that collect and retain such information are under increasing attack by cyber - criminals around the world. A significant actual or potential theft, ransom, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of service provider, customer, employee or other personally identifiable data, whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise, non - compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in loss of confidential information, damage to our reputation, early termination of our service provider contracts, significant costs, fines, litigation, regulatory investigations or actions and other liabilities or actions against us. Moreover, to the extent that any such exposure leads to credit card fraud or identity theft, we may experience a general decline in existing or prospective customer confidence in our business, which may lead to an increase in attrition rates or may make it more difficult to attract new customers. Such an event could additionally result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market's perception of the security and reliability of our services. Security breaches of, or sustained attacks against, this infrastructure could create system disruptions and shutdowns that could result in disruptions to our operations. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We cannot be certain that advances in cyber - attack capabilities or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that support our platform and solutions. If any one of these risks materializes our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.. We may experience difficulty obtaining materials or components for our Quench products.. Our Quench business, including the recently acquired Wellsys business, utilizes third parties both inside and outside the United States to manufacture our equipment and relies upon these manufacturers to produce and deliver quality equipment on a timely basis and at an acceptable cost. Disruptions to the business, financial stability or operations, including due to strikes, labor disputes, political or governmental issues or other disruptions to the workforce, of these manufacturers, or to their ability to produce the equipment we require in accordance with our and our customers' requirements could significantly affect our ability to fulfill customer demand on a timely basis which could cause reputational harm, and materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.. Our holding company structure effectively subordinates our parent company to the rights of the creditors of certain of our subsidiaries.. A majority of our assets are held by our subsidiaries. As a result, our rights and the rights of our creditors to participate in the distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon such subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary's creditors, except to the extent that we are reorganized as a creditor of such subsidiary, in which case our claims would still be subject to the claims of any secured creditor of such subsidiary and of any holder of indebtedness of such subsidiary senior to that held by us. As of December 31, 2017, our subsidiaries had approximately $96.0 million of indebtedness (net of discounts and excluding intercompany indebtedness). 33. outstanding,  of which AquaVenture Holdings Limited, the ultimate parent company, is jointly and severally liable for $69.8 million (net of discounts).. Since operations are conducted through our subsidiaries, our cash flow and ability to service debt is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and distributions to us. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities, and in some cases, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due pursuant to indebtedness of other subsidiaries or us or to make any funds available therefor. In addition, the payment of dividends and the making of loan advances to us by our subsidiaries are contingent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and are subject to various business considerations and, for certain subsidiaries, restrictive loan covenants contained in the instruments governing the indebtedness of such subsidiaries, including covenants which restrict in certain circumstances the payment of dividends and distributions and the transfer of assets to us.. Seven Seas Water may invest in projects with third - party investors that could result in conflicts.. We may from time to time invest in projects with third - party investors who may possess certain shareholder rights. Actions by an investor could subject our assets to additional risk as a result of any of the following circumstances:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe investors might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our, or the project - level entity's, interests or goals; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe investor may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives.. Although we generally seek to maintain sufficient control of any investment to permit our objectives to be achieved, we might not be able to take action with respect to certain matters without the approval of the investors or lenders. We may experience strained relations with certain of our investors, resulting in liquidity constraints due to our third - party investors' failure to fund their respective capital commitments.. In Curaao, our customer is dependent on Petrleos de Venezuela S.A., or PdVSA (the state - owned oil company of Venezuela), and any financial or other issues our customer experiences with PdVSA could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.. Our desalination facility in Curaao sells industrial quality water to Curaao Refinery Utilities B.V., a government owned utility that provides utility services to a refinery it has leased to PdVSA. The current term of this water sales agreement expires in 2019, but will extend to 2022 if our customer extends the lease of the refinery to PdVSA. Any financial or other issues our customer experiences with PdVSA could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.. Our ability to grow our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to raise capital on favorable terms.. From time to time, we rely on access to capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows. Our ability to arrange for financing on either a recourse or non - recourse basis and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic and capital market conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of bank credit or access to institutional credit markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\taccess to bilateral or multilateral funding sources;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinvestor confidence;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour financial condition, performance and prospects in general and/or that of any subsidiary requiring the financing as well as companies in our industry or similar financial circumstances; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in tax and securities laws which are conducive to raising capital.. 34. Should future access to capital not be available to us, it may become necessary for us to sell assets or we may decide not to build new plants, expand or improve existing facilities or pursue acquisitions, any of which would affect our future growth, results of operations and financial condition.. An impairment in the carrying value of long - lived assets, long - term contract costs, goodwill or intangible assets would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.. Long - lived assets are initially recorded at cost and are amortized or depreciated over their useful lives. Long - term contract costs consist of both deferred contract costs related to service concession arrangements and contract intangible assets related to service concession arrangements established in purchase accounting. Long - term contract costs are amortized on a straight - line basis over the remaining service concession arrangement period. Long - lived assets and long - term contract costs are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recognition and measurement of a potential impairment is performed on assets grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level where identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of long - lived assets and long - term contract costs classified as contract intangible assets are measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Recoverability of long - term contract costs classified as deferred contract costs are measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated through the performance of the remaining services under the contract. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third - party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying these factors. These events or changes in circumstances and the related analyses could result in additional long - lived asset impairment charges in the future. Impairment charges could substantially affect our financial results in the periods of such charges.. We have significant goodwill and intangible assets that are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of events or changes in circumstances. As of December 31, 2017, intangible assets, net and goodwill were $52.3 million and $99.5 million, respectively. We assess the potential impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis, as well as when interim events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include disruptions to our business, failure to realize the economic benefit from acquisitions of other companies and intangible assets, slower industry growth rates and declines in operating results and market capitalization. Determining whether an impairment exists, along with the amount of the potential impairment, involves quantitative data and qualitative criteria that are based on estimates and assumptions requiring significant management judgment. Future events, new information or changes in circumstances may alter management's valuation of an intangible asset. The timing and amount of impairment charges recorded in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income and write - downs recorded in our consolidated balance sheets could vary if management's conclusions change.. We did not record any goodwill impairment during 2017 and 2016 for the Seven Seas Water or Quench reporting units. A change in forecast or assumptions used in the impairment analysis could result in an impairment charge. In 2015, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $27.4 million related to the Quench reporting unit.. We may not be able to adapt to changes in technology and government regulation fast enough to remain competitive.. The water purification industry is highly technical and thus impacted by changing technology, competitively imposed process standards and regulatory requirements, each of which influences the demand for our products and services. Advances in technology and changes in legislative, regulatory or industrial requirements may render certain of our purification products and processes obsolete or increase our compliance costs. Our inability to adapt to these changes could affect our ability to compete, which could impact our future growth and materially affect our business.. 35. Changes in tax law, determinations by tax authorities and/or changes in our effective tax rates may adversely affect our business and financial results.. Under current law, we expect to be treated as a non - U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, uncertainties in the relative valuation between our U.S. business and our non - U.S. business at the time of our Corporate Reorganization could adversely affect our status as a non - U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and could adversely affect our effective tax rate. In addition, changes to Section 7874 or the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, other changes in law, or new interpretations of the meaning or scope of these rules, could adversely affect our status as a non - U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and adversely affect our effective tax rate. Some of the Section 7874 regulations are complex, and as such their application to any particular set of facts is uncertain. While we believe we will be treated as a non - U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such belief is based on, among other things, facts that may change or be unclear, valuations which are inherently subjective and judgments that may prove to be incorrect. If such belief is incorrect, there could be a material adverse impact on our expected tax position and effective tax rate.. Our Quench business operates in the United States and Canada, and all of our Seven Seas Water customer revenue was generated outside the United States in the year ended December 31, 2017. In light of the global nature of our business and the fact that we are subject to tax at the federal, state and local levels in the United States and in other countries and jurisdictions, a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour decision to distribute U.S. or non - U.S. earnings to the parent company;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsustainability of historical income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability (or inability) to use net operating loss carry - forwards to offset future taxable income and any adjustments to the amount of the net operating loss carry - forwards we can utilize;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in tax laws, including legislative changes, some of which could include fundamental tax reform, that impact favorable tax treatment and/or the deductibility of certain expenses from taxable income; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in deferred tax valuation allowances.. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods.. We could be adversely impacted by environmental, health and safety legislation, regulation and permits and climate change matters.. We are subject to numerous international, national, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, as well as the requirements of the independent government agencies and development banks that provide financing for many of our projects, which require us to incur significant ongoing costs and capital expenditures and may expose us to substantial liabilities. Such laws and regulations govern, among other things: emissions to air; discharges to water; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials; and the cleanup of contaminated properties. Currently, we believe we are in compliance with these laws and regulations, but there is no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by any such liabilities, costs or claims in the future, either under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. If we are found not to be in compliance we may be subject to lawsuits asserting claims or fees, fines, or penalties, which could adversely affect our business.. We must obtain, maintain and/or renew a number of permits that impose strict conditions, requirements and obligations, including those relating to various environmental, health and safety matters, in connection with our current and future operations and development of our facilities. The permitting rules and their interpretations are complex, and the level of environmental protection needed to obtain required permits has tended to become more stringent over time.. 36. In many cases, the public (including environmental interest groups) is entitled to comment upon and submit objections to permit applications and related environmental analysis, attend public hearings regarding whether such permits should be issued and otherwise participate in the permitting process, including challenging the issuance of permits, validity of environmental analyses and determinations and the manner in which permitted activities are conducted. Permits required for our operations and for the development of our facilities may not be issued, maintained or renewed in a timely fashion or at all, may be issued or renewed upon conditions that restrict our ability to operate or develop our facilities economically or may be subsequently revoked. Any failure to obtain, maintain or renew our permits, as well as other permitting delays and permitting conditions or requirements that are more stringent than we anticipate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Foreign, federal, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies have proposed various legislative and regulatory measures relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions and energy policies. If these laws, regulations and requirements become more stringent in the future, we may experience increased liabilities, compliance costs and capital expenditures or difficulty in our ability to comply with applicable requirements or obtain financing for our projects.. The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are also highly uncertain and would vary depending on type of physical impact and geographic location. Climate change physical impacts could include changing temperatures, water shortages, changes in weather and rainfall patterns, and changing storm patterns and intensities. Many climate change predictions, if true, present several potential challenges to water and wastewater utilities, such as increased precipitation and flooding, potential degradation of water quality, and changes in demand for water services.. We are subject to litigation and reputational risk as a result of the nature of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.. From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits that arise from our business. Litigation may, for example, relate to product liability claims, personal injury, property damage, vehicle accidents, regulatory issues, contract disputes or employment matters. The occurrence of any of these matters could also create possible damage to our reputation. The defense and ultimate outcome of lawsuits against us may result in higher operating expenses. Higher operating expenses or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our business, including to our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.. We will incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives. We may fail to comply with the rules that apply to public companies, including Section 404 of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act of 2002, which could result in sanctions or other penalties that would harm our business.. As a public company, and particularly after we cease to be an \"emerging growth company,\" we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as a public company, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, and regulations regarding corporate governance requirements relating to director independence, distributing annual and interim reports, shareholder meetings, approvals and voting, soliciting proxies, conflicts of interest and a code of conduct.  The listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations cause us to incur significant legal and financial compliance costs, and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These reporting requirements, rules and regulations, coupled with the increase in potential litigation exposure associated with being a public company, could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or board committees or to serve as executive officers, or to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors' and officers' insurance, on acceptable terms.. The Sarbanes Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. In particular, Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, or Section 404, requires management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm potentially to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As an emerging growth company, we expect to avail ourselves of the exemption from the requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. 37. under Section 404. However, we may no longer avail ourselves of this exemption when we cease to be an emerging growth company. When our independent registered public accounting firm is required to undertake an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, the cost of our compliance with Section 404 will correspondingly increase. Our compliance with applicable provisions of Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time on compliance related issues as we implement additional corporate governance practices and comply with reporting requirements. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 applicable to us in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.  For example, in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for 2014 and 2015, material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting was identified.  While we have remediated this material weakness, we cannot provide assurance that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future.. We have adopted certain new accounting pronouncements, and expect to adopt other new accounting pronouncements for 2019, that will result in changes to our previously reported results and forecasts and the patterns of our revenues, gross profit, net loss and other key metrics, including non-GAAP measures.. In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding revenue from contracts with customers that specifies that revenue should be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods and will require enhanced disclosures. In addition, the FASB issued authoritative guidance in March 2017 related to the determination of the customer in a service concession arrangement, which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods. We adopted the guidance regarding both revenue from contracts with customers and the determination of the customer in a service concession contract (together referred to as \"Adopted Revenue Guidance\") on a full retrospective basis on January 1, 2018 applying the guidance to all contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2016.. While the Adopted Revenue Guidance will have no impact on the amount of cash generated under our contracts, we concluded that the timing and amount of revenue recognized under our contracts that are accounted for as service concession arrangements, including current contracts and those entered into in the future, will be different from the way we have recognized revenue through the year ended December 31, 2017. Under the Adopted Revenue Guidance, we are required to recognize revenue based on the completion of the identifiable performance obligations of the contract, including the construction of infrastructure for the customer and providing operating and maintenance services (\"O&M\") on the infrastructure constructed for the customer, and the timing in which control is transferred to the customer for each of the performance obligations. This timing of revenue recognition, among other less material changes to the accounting for our contracts with customers, will have an effect on revenues, gross profit, net loss and other key metrics, including non-GAAP measures, for both current and potential future contracts entered into with customers. The Adopted Revenue Guidance will result in differences in our previously reported amount of revenues, gross profit, net loss and other key metrics, including non-GAAP measures.  See Note 2 - \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.. In addition, during February 2016 the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding leases that requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and right - of - use asset for operating leases, with the exception of short - term leases. In addition, lessor accounting was modified to align, where necessary, with lessee accounting modifications and the authoritative guidance regarding revenue from contracts with customers. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, and early adoption is permitted. The Company has developed its assessment approach and has begun evaluating the potential impact of the accounting and disclosure requirements on the consolidated financial statements. The Company expects to elect the practical expedients provided for within the authoritative guidance which exempts the Company from having to reassess: (i) whether expired or existing contracts contain leases, (ii) the lease classification for expired or existing leases, and (iii) initial direct costs for existing leases. For lessor accounting, as a result of electing the practical expedients, the Company does not anticipate material changes to the accounting for operating leases or sales-type leases that existed at the adoption date. For lessee accounting, the Company expects to recognize a lease liability and right-of-use asset for operating leases with a term of more than 12 months. The adoption of the lease guidance for lessor. 38. accounting could result in a change in the accounting for leases amended or new leases entered into after January 1, 2019 from how we have historically accounted for leases. This change in accounting could result in changes to revenues, gross profit, net loss and other key metrics, including non-GAAP measures.. As a result, our future reported financial results will change from those previously reported, making comparisons based on previously reported financial statements difficult.  While we expect to endeavor to educate the investment community regarding the impacts of adopting these new accounting pronouncements, there can be no assurance that their adoption will not cause confusion in the marketplace, which may adversely impact the trading price for our shares.. U.S. holders of our ordinary shares may suffer adverse tax consequences if we are characterized as a passive foreign investment company.. Based on the current and anticipated value of our assets and the composition of our income, assets and operations, we do not expect to be a \"passive foreign investment company,\" or PFIC, for the current taxable year or in the foreseeable future. However, the application of the PFIC rules is subject to uncertainty in several respects, and we cannot assure you that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, will not take a contrary position. Furthermore, a separate determination must be made after the close of each taxable year as to whether we are a PFIC for that year. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will not be a PFIC for our current taxable year or any future taxable year. A non - U.S. corporation will be considered a PFIC for any taxable year if (i) at least 75% of its gross income is passive income, or (ii) at least 50% of the value of its assets (based on an average of the quarterly values of the assets during a taxable year) is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income. The value of our assets generally will be determined by reference to the market price of our Shares, which may fluctuate considerably. If we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder holds a share, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could apply to such U.S. Holder.. You may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences if we are classified as a Controlled Foreign Corporation.. Each \"Ten Percent Shareholder\" (as defined below) in a non - U.S. corporation that is classified as a \"controlled foreign corporation,\" or a CFC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally is required to include in income for U.S. federal tax purposes such Ten Percent Shareholder's pro rata share of the CFC's \"Subpart F income\" and investment of earnings in U.S. property, even if the CFC has made no distributions to its shareholders. Each Ten Percent Shareholder is also required to include in gross income its \"global intangible low-taxed income,\" (within the meaning of Code Section 951A) which is determined by reference to the income of CFCs of which such Ten Percent Shareholder is a Ten Percent Shareholder. Ten Percent Shareholders that are corporations may be entitled to a deduction equal to the foreign portion of any dividend when a dividend is paid. A non - U.S. corporation generally will be classified as a CFC for U.S federal income tax purposes if Ten Percent Shareholders own in the aggregate, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of either the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of such corporation entitled to vote or of the total value of the stock of such corporation. A \"Ten Percent Shareholder\" is a U.S. person (as defined by the Code), who owns or is considered to own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of such corporation or 10% or more of the value of all classes of stock of such corporation. The determination of CFC status is complex and includes attribution rules, the application of which is not entirely certain. We may currently be a CFC, and we may continue to be a CFC. In addition, even if we are not currently a CFC, it is possible that one or more shareholders treated as U.S. persons for U.S. federal income tax purposes will acquire, directly or indirectly, enough shares to be treated as a Ten Percent Shareholder after application of the constructive ownership rules and, together with any other Ten Percent Shareholders of the company, cause the company to be treated as a CFC for U.S. federal income tax purposes in the future. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the potential adverse U.S. tax consequences of becoming a Ten Percent Shareholder in a CFC.. Comprehensive tax reform legislation could adversely affect our business and financial condition.. The U.S. government has recently enacted comprehensive tax legislation that includes significant changes to the taxation of business entities, commonly referred to as the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" (\"TCJ Act\"). These changes include, among others, a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, the elimination or modification of certain previously allowed deductions (including substantially limiting interest deductibility), allowing for the expensing of capital expenditures, and putting into effect the migration from a. 39. \"worldwide\" system of taxation to a territorial system. The overall impact of this tax reform is uncertain, and it is possible that our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. We continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business. We urge our shareholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to any such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in our ordinary shares.. Risks Related to Our Ordinary Shares. Insiders have substantial control over us, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.. Our directors, executive officers and each of our shareholders who own greater than 5% of our outstanding ordinary shares and their affiliates, in the aggregate, currently own more than 50% of our outstanding ordinary shares. As a result, these shareholders, if acting together, would be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. They may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and that may be adverse to your interests. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our other shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their ordinary shares as part of a sale of our company and might affect the market price of our ordinary shares.. Anti-takeover provisions in our memorandum and articles of association could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our shareholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our ordinary shares.. Provisions in our memorandum and articles of association may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our memorandum and articles of association include provisions that:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAuthorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the shareholders undesignated preferred shares;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRequire that action by written consent in lieu of a meeting be adopted only if the shareholders unanimously consent to this manner of decision making;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tEstablish an advance notice procedure for shareholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our shareholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tLimit the manner in which our shareholders can remove directors from the board;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tProhibit certain persons who own in excess of 15% of our outstanding ordinary shares from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding ordinary shares, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tEstablish that our board of directors is divided into three classes - Class I, Class II and Class III - with each class serving staggered terms; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRequire a super-majority of votes to amend certain of the above-mentioned provisions.. These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control. These provisions may also frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.. Any provision of our memorandum and articles of association or British Virgin Islands law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their ordinary shares, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our ordinary shares.. 40. It may be difficult to enforce a U.S. or foreign judgment against us, our directors and officers outside the United States, or to assert U.S. securities laws claims outside of the United States.. We are a company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. As a result, it may be difficult for a shareholder to effect service of process within the United States upon us, our directors and officers, or to enforce against us, or them, judgments obtained in U.S. courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state therein. Additionally, it may be difficult to assert U.S. securities law claims in actions originally instituted outside of the United States. Foreign courts may refuse to hear a U.S. securities law claim because foreign courts may not be the most appropriate forums in which to bring such a claim. Even if a foreign court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that the law of the jurisdiction in which the foreign court resides, and not U.S. law, is applicable to the claim. Further, if U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process, and certain matters of procedure would still be governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the foreign court resides.. As the rights of shareholders under British Virgin Islands law differ from those under U.S. law, you may have fewer protections as a shareholder.. Our corporate affairs are governed by our Amended Memorandum and Articles of Association, the British Virgin Island Business Companies Act, 2004, as amended from time to time (the \"BVI Act\") and the common law of the British Virgin Islands. The rights of shareholders to take legal action against our directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under British Virgin Islands law are to a large extent governed by the BVI Act and the common law of the British Virgin Islands. The common law of the British Virgin Islands is derived in part from judicial precedent in the British Virgin Islands as well as from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the British Virgin Islands.. The rights of shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under British Virgin Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the British Virgin Islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and some states (such as Delaware) have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law. In addition, British Virgin Islands law does not make a distinction between public and private companies and some of the protections and safeguards (such as statutory pre-emption rights, save to the extent that they are expressly provided for in the Amended Memorandum and Articles of Association) that investors may expect to find in relation to a public company are not provided for under British Virgin Islands corporate statutory law.. As a result of all of the above, holders of our ordinary shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by our management, directors or major shareholders than they would as shareholders of a U.S. company.. Shareholders in British Virgin Islands companies may not be able to initiate shareholder derivative actions, thereby depriving a shareholder of the ability to protect its interests.. While statutory provisions do exist in British Virgin Islands law for derivative actions to be brought in certain circumstances, shareholders in British Virgin Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in a federal court of the United States. The circumstances in which any such action may be brought, and the procedures and defenses that may be available in respect to any such action, may result in the rights of shareholders of a British Virgin Islands company being more limited than those of shareholders of a company organized in the United States. Accordingly, shareholders may have fewer alternatives available to them if they believe that corporate wrongdoing has occurred. The British Virgin Islands courts are also unlikely to: (i) recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts in the United States based on certain civil liability provisions of U.S. securities law; or (ii) to impose liabilities against us, in original actions brought in the British Virgin Islands, based on certain civil liability provisions of U.S. securities laws that are penal in nature or that relate to taxes or similar fiscal or revenue obligations or would be viewed as contrary to British Virgin Island public policy or the proceedings pursuant to which judgment was obtained were contrary to natural justice. There is no statutory recognition in the British Virgin Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, although the courts of the British Virgin Islands will in certain circumstances recognize and enforce the non-penal judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits.. 41. The laws of the British Virgin Islands provide limited protection for minority shareholders, so minority shareholders will not have the same options as to recourse in comparison to the United States if the shareholders are dissatisfied with the conduct of our affairs.. Under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, there is limited statutory protection of minority shareholders other than the provisions of the BVI Act dealing with shareholder remedies. The principal protections under statutory law are unfair prejudice relief and an action to enforce the BVI Act or the Amended Memorandum and Articles of Association brought by the shareholders. Shareholders are entitled to have the affairs of the company conducted in accordance with the BVI Act and the Amended Memorandum and Articles of Association.. There are common law rights for the protection of shareholders that may be invoked, largely dependent on English company law, since the common law of the British Virgin Islands is limited. Under the general rule pursuant to English company law known as the rule in Foss v. Harbottle, a court will generally refuse to interfere with the management of a company at the insistence of a minority of its shareholders who express dissatisfaction with the conduct of the company's affairs by the majority or the board of directors and that the principal remedy for an aggrieved minority shareholder was presentation of a winding up petition on just and equitable grounds. The BVI Act amplifies this position by providing that a shareholder is not entitled to bring an action or intervene in proceedings in the name of or on behalf of a BVI company. Every shareholder is entitled to have the affairs of the company conducted properly according to British Virgin Islands law and the company's constituent documents.. If securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our share, our share price and trading volume could decline.. The trading market for our ordinary shares will depend on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts change their recommendation or outlook regarding us or our shares, or provide more favorable relative recommendations or outlooks about our competitors, our share price could likely decline. Additionally, if any of the analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, our share price and trading volume could decline.. Future sales of our ordinary shares in the public market could cause our share price to fall.. Sales of a substantial number of our ordinary shares in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could significantly reduce the market price of our ordinary shares and impair our ability to raise adequate capital through the sale of additional equity securities.. The holders of 18,087,347 ordinary shares will be entitled to rights with respect to registration of such shares under the Securities Act pursuant to an investors' rights agreement between such holders and us. If such holders, by exercising their registration rights, sell a large number of shares, the market price for our ordinary shares could be harmed. If we file a registration statement for the purpose of selling additional shares to raise capital and are required to include shares held by these holders pursuant to the exercise of their registration rights, our ability to raise capital may be impaired. We have filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register shares for issuance under our equity incentive plans, including our 2016 Share Option and Incentive Plan and our 2016 Employee Share Purchase Plan. Each of these plans provides for automatic increases in the shares reserved for issuance under the plan which could result in additional dilution to our shareholders. Once we register these shares, they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance and vesting.. We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.. We have never declared or paid any dividends on our ordinary shares. We currently intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our ordinary shares may be limited by restrictions under the terms of one of our credit agreements. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our ordinary shares if the market price of our ordinary shares increases.. 42"
