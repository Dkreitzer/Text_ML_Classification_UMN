[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors.. Risks Relating to Our Business. We have a history of losses since inception and if we continue to incur losses, the price of our shares can be expected to fall.. We experienced losses from inception through June 30, 2012, with net income for the years ended June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2014. However, we experienced losses for the fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017, and continued profitability is not assured. From our inception through June 30, 2017, our cumulative losses from operations are approximately $183 million. Until the Company's products and services can generate sufficient annual revenues, the Company will be required to use its cash and cash equivalents on hand, its line of credit, and may raise capital to meet its cash flow requirements including the issuance of common stock or debt financing. For the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, we incurred a net loss of $1.9 million and $6.8 million, respectively. If we continue to incur losses in the future, the price of our common stock can be expected to fall.. The occurrence of material unanticipated expenses may require us to divert our cash resources from achieving our business plan, adversely affecting our financial performance and resulting in the decline of our stock price.. In the event we incur any material unanticipated expenses, we may be required to divert our cash resources from our operating activities in order to fund any such expenses. Any such occurrence may cause our anticipated connections, revenues, gross profits, and other financial metrics for the 2017 fiscal year and beyond to be materially adversely affected. In such event, the price of our common stock could be expected to fall.. The inability of our customers to utilize third party leasing companies under our QuickStart program would materially adversely affect our cash generated from operating activities and/or attaining our business plan.. The use of third party leasing companies by our customers under our QuickStart program positively affects our net cash provided by operating activities because we receive the purchase price from the leasing company at the time of the sale. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such third party leasing companies. To the extent that third party leasing companies would not be available, we would lease the equipment directly to our customers. In such event, our net cash from operating activities would be adversely affected and we may be required to incur additional equity or debt financing to fund operations. In the alternative, we would not be able to attain our business plan, including anticipated connections and revenues.. We may require additional financing or find it necessary to raise capital to sustain our operations and without it we may not be able to achieve our business plan.. At June 30, 2017, we had net working capital of $5.8 million. We had net cash (used in) provided by operating activities of $(6.8) million, $6.5 million, and $(1.7) million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Although we believe that we have adequate existing resources to provide for our funding requirements over the next 12 months, there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to generate sufficient funds thereafter. Unless we maintain or grow our current level of operations, we may need additional funds to continue these operations. We may also need additional capital to update our technology or respond to unusual or unanticipated non-operational events. Should the financing that we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, the consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.. Our future operating results may fluctuate.. Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to continue to drive revenues from license and transaction fees and our ability to develop and commercialize new products and services. Our operating results may fluctuate based upon many factors, including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in revenue generated by our business;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in operating expenses;. 16. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to establish or maintain effective relationships with significant partners and suppliers on acceptable terms;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe amount of debit or credit card interchange rates that are charged by Visa and MasterCard;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe fees that we charge our customers for processing services;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe successful operation of our network;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe commercial success of our customers, which could be affected by such factors as general economic conditions;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of product and price competition;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing and cost of, and our ability to develop and successfully commercialize, new or enhanced products and services;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactivities of, and acquisitions or announcements by, competitors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe impact from any impairment of inventory, goodwill, fixed assets or intangibles;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe impact of any changes of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability to increase the number of customer connections to our network;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmarketing programs which delay realization by us of monthly service fees on our new connections;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe material breach of security of any of the Company's systems or third party systems utilized by the Company; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe anticipation of and response to technological changes.. Our products may fail to gain substantial increased market acceptance. As a result, we may not generate sufficient revenues or profit margins to achieve our financial objectives or growth plans.. There can be no assurances that demand for our products will be sufficient to enable us to generate sufficient revenue or become profitable on a sustainable basis. Likewise, no assurance can be given that we will be able to have a sufficient number of ePorts® connected to our network or sell or lease equipment utilizing our network to enough locations to achieve significant revenues. Alternatively, the locations which utilize the network may not be successful locations and our revenues would be adversely affected. We may lose locations utilizing our products to competitors, or may not be able to install our products at competitors' locations, or may not obtain future locations which would be obtained by our competitors. In addition, there can be no assurance that our products could evolve or be improved to meet the future needs of the marketplace. In any such event, we may not be able to achieve our growth plans, including anticipated connections and revenue growth.. We may be required to incur further debt to meet future capital requirements of our business. Should we be required to incur additional debt, the restrictions imposed by the terms of such debt could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to respond to changes in our business.. If we incur additional debt, we may be subject to the following risks:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour vulnerability to adverse economic conditions and competitive pressures may be heightened;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry may be limited;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour debt covenants may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness would prevent us from pursuing;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets and make certain investments;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta significant portion of our cash flows could be used to service our indebtedness;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates if any of our debt obligations are subject to variable interest rates; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired.. 17. Table of Contents. We cannot assure you that our leverage and such restrictions will not materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. In addition, we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when required or, if available, will be on terms satisfactory to us.. Our bank borrowing agreement contains restrictions which may limit our flexibility in operating and growing our business.. Our bank borrowing agreement contains covenants regarding our maintenance of a minimum quarterly adjusted EBITDA as defined in our loan agreement and certain numbers of connections. Our loan agreement also includes covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions, including among other things:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur additional indebtedness or issue equity;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our common stock;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake certain investments (including acquisitions) and distributions;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsell certain assets;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcreate liens;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into certain transactions with respect to our affiliates;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tability to enter into business combinations; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcertain other financial and non-financial covenants.. We were in compliance with these covenants as of June 30, 2017. Failure to be in compliance with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of our outstanding indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. The loss of one or more of our key customers could significantly reduce our revenues, results of operations, and net income.. We have derived, and believe we may continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenues from one large customer or a limited number of large customers. Customer concentrations for the years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:. 2017 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t     \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t2016 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t     \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t2015 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tTrade account and finance receivables - one customer \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t 42 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t%   \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 18 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t%   \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 35 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t% \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tLicense and transaction processing revenues - one customer \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t 20 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t%   \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 16 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t%   \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 21 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t% \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tEquipment sales revenue - one customer \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t 37 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t%   \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 28 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t%   \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 17 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t%. Our customers may buy less of our products or services depending on their own technological developments, end-user demand for our products and internal budget cycles. A major customer in one year may not purchase any of our products or services in another year, which may negatively affect our financial performance. We have offered, and may in the future offer, discounts to our large customers to incentivize them to continue to utilize our products and services. If we are required to sell products to any of our large customers at reduced prices or unfavorable terms, our results of operations and revenue could be materially adversely affected. Further, there is no assurance that our customers will continue to utilize our transaction processing and related services as our customer agreements are generally cancelable by the customer on thirty to sixty days' notice.. We depend on our key personnel and, if they leave us, our business could be adversely affected.. We are dependent on key management personnel, particularly the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Stephen P. Herbert. The loss of services of Mr. Herbert or other officers could dramatically affect our business prospects. Our executive officers and certain of our officers and employees are particularly valuable to us because:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthey have specialized knowledge about our company and operations;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthey have specialized skills that are important to our operations; or. 18. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthey would be particularly difficult to replace.. We have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Herbert, which contains confidentiality and non-compete provisions. The agreement provided for an initial term continuing through January 1, 2013, which is automatically renewed for consecutive one year periods unless terminated by either Mr. Herbert or the Company upon at least 90 days' notice prior to the end of the initial term or any one-year extension thereof.. We also may be unable to retain other existing senior management, sales personnel, and development and engineering personnel critical to our ability to execute our business plan, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs.. Our dependence on proprietary technology and limited ability to protect our intellectual property may adversely affect our ability to compete.. Challenge to our ownership of our intellectual property could materially damage our business prospects. Our technology may infringe upon the proprietary rights of others. Our ability to execute our business plan is dependent, in part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for our proprietary products, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others.. Through June 30, 2017, we had 13 pending United States and foreign patent applications, and will consider filing applications for additional patents covering aspects of our future developments, although there can be no assurance that we will do so. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will maintain or prosecute these applications. The United States Government and other countries have granted us 96 patents as of June 30, 2017. There can be no assurance that:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany of the remaining patent applications will be granted to us;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe will develop additional products that are patentable or do not infringe the patents of others;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany patents issued to us will provide us with any competitive advantages or adequate protection for our products;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others; or. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany of our products would not infringe the patents of others.. If any of our products or services is found to have infringed any patent, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses to continue to manufacture, use, sell, and license such product or service or that we will not have to pay damages and/or be enjoined as a result of such infringement. Even if a patent application is granted for any of our products, there can be no assurance that the patented technology will be a commercial success or result in any profits to us.. If we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology or fail to enforce or prosecute our patents against others, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us, which could result in the loss of customers and our business being adversely affected. Patent and proprietary rights litigation entails substantial legal and other costs, and diverts Company resources as well as the attention of our management. There can be no assurance we will have the necessary financial resources to appropriately defend or prosecute our intellectual property rights in connection with any such litigation.. Competition from others could prevent the Company from increasing revenue and achieving its growth plans.. While we are a leading provider and believe we have the largest installed base of unattended POS electronic payment systems in the small ticket, beverage and food vending industry, our competitors are increasingly and actively marketing products and services that compete with our products and services in this vending space. The competition includes manufacturers who may include in their new vending machines their own (or another third party's) cashless payment systems and services other than our systems and services. While we believe our products and services are superior to our competitors, many of our competitors are much larger enterprises and have substantially greater revenues. In addition to these competitors, there are also numerous credit card processors that offer card processing services to traditional retail establishments that could decide to offer similar services to the industries that we serve. Competition from other companies, including those that are well established and have substantially greater resources, may reduce our profitability or reduce our business opportunities. Competition may result in lower profit margins on our products or may reduce potential profits or result in a loss of some or all of our customer base. To the extent that our competitors are able to offer more attractive technology, our ability to compete could be adversely affected.. 19. Table of Contents. The termination of any of our relationships with third parties upon whom we rely for supplies and services that are critical to our products could adversely affect our business and delay achievement of our business plan.. We depend on arrangements with third parties for a variety of component parts used in our products. We have contracted with various suppliers to assist us to develop and manufacture our ePort® products. For other components, we do not have supply contracts with any of our third-party suppliers and we purchase components as needed from time to time. We have contracted with a third-party data system recovery vendor to host our network in a secure, 24/7 environment to ensure the reliability of our network services. We also have contracted with multiple land-based telecommunications providers to ensure the reliability of our land-based network. If these business relationships are terminated, the implementation of our business plan may be delayed until an alternative supplier or service provider can be retained. If we are unable to find another source or one that is comparable, the content and quality of our products could suffer and our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.. A disruption in the manufacturing capabilities of our third-party manufacturers, suppliers or distributors would negatively impact our ability to meet customer requirements.. We depend upon third-party manufacturers, suppliers and distributors to deliver components free from defects, competitive in functionality and cost, and in compliance with our specifications and delivery schedules. Since we generally do not maintain large inventories of our products or components, any termination of, or significant disruption in, our manufacturing capability or our relationship with our third-party manufacturers or suppliers may prevent us from filling customer orders in a timely manner.. We have occasionally experienced, and may in the future experience, delays in delivery of products and delivery of products of inferior quality from third-party manufacturers. Although alternate manufacturers and suppliers are generally available to produce our products and product components, the number of manufacturers or suppliers of some of our products and components is limited, and a qualified replacement manufacturer or supplier could take several months. In addition, our use of third-party manufacturers reduces our direct control over product quality, manufacturing timing, yields and costs. Disruption of the manufacture or supply of our products and components, or a third-party manufacturer's or supplier's failure to remain competitive in functionality, quality or price, could delay or interrupt our ability to manufacture or deliver our products to customers on a timely basis, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.. Substantially all of the network service contracts with our customers are terminable for any or no reason upon thirty to sixty days' advance notice.. Substantially all of our customers may terminate their network service contracts with us for any or no reason upon providing us with thirty or sixty days' advance notice. Accordingly, consistent demand for and satisfaction with our products by our customers is critical to our financial condition and future success. Problems, defects, or dissatisfaction with our products or services or competition in the marketplace could cause us to lose a substantial number of our customers with minimal notice. If a substantial number of our customers were to exercise their termination rights, it would result in a material adverse effect to our business, operating results, and financial condition.. Our reliance on our wireless telecommunication service provider exposes us to a number of risks over which we have no control, including risks with respect to increased prices and termination of essential services.. The operation of our wireless networked devices depends upon the capacity, reliability and security of services provided to us by our wireless telecommunication services providers, AT&T Mobility and Verizon Wireless. We have no control over the operation, quality or maintenance of these services or whether the vendor will improve or reduce its services or continue to provide services that are essential to our business. In addition, subject to our existing contracts with them, our wireless telecommunication services providers may increase their prices, which would increase our costs. If our wireless telecommunication services providers were to cease to provide essential services or to significantly increase prices, we could be required to find alternative vendors for these services. With a limited number of vendors, we could experience significant delays in obtaining new or replacement services, which could lead to slowdowns or failures of our network. In addition, we may have to replace our existing ePort® devices that are already installed in the marketplace and which are utilizing the existing vendor's services. This could significantly harm our reputation and could cause us to lose customers and revenues.. 20. Table of Contents. We may not be able to adapt to changing technology and our customers' technology needs.. We face rapidly changing technology and frequent new service offerings that can render existing services obsolete or unmarketable. Our future depends, in part, on our ability to enhance existing services and to develop, introduce and market, on a timely and cost effective basis, new services that keep pace with technological developments and customer requirements. Developing new products and technologies is a complex, uncertain process requiring innovation and accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. When changes to the product line are announced, we will be challenged to manage possible shortened life cycles for existing products and continue to sell existing products. Our inability to respond effectively to any of these challenges may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial success.. Security is vital to our customers and therefore breaches in the security of transactions involving our products or services could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.. Protection against fraud is of key importance to purchasers and end-users of our products. We incorporate security features, such as encryption software and secure hardware, into our products to protect against fraud in electronic payment transactions and to ensure the privacy and integrity of consumer data. We design and test our products to industry security standards and our products and methodologies are under periodic review and improvement. Our products and services and third party products and services that are utilized by us may be vulnerable to breaches in security due to defects in our security mechanisms, the operating system and applications in our hardware platform. Security vulnerabilities could jeopardize the security of information transmitted or stored using our products. If the security of the information in our products is compromised, our reputation and marketplace acceptance of our products will be adversely affected, which would adversely affect our results of operations, and subject us to potential liability. If our security applications are breached and sensitive data is lost or stolen, we could incur significant costs to not only assess and repair any damage to our systems, but also to reimburse customers for losses that occur from the fraudulent use of the data. We may also be subject to fines and penalties from the credit card associations in the event of the loss of confidential card information.. Our products and services may be vulnerable to security breach.. Credit card issuers have promulgated credit card security guidelines as part of their ongoing efforts to battle identity theft and credit card fraud. We continue to work with credit card issuers to assure that our products and services comply with these rules. There can be no assurances, however, that our products and services or third party products and services utilized by us are invulnerable to unauthorized access or hacking. When there is unauthorized access to credit card data that results in financial loss, there is the potential that parties could seek damages from us, and our business reputation and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.. If we fail to adhere to the standards of the Visa and MasterCard credit card associations, our registrations with these associations could be terminated and we could be required to stop providing payment processing services for Visa and MasterCard.. Substantially all of the transactions handled by our network involve Visa or MasterCard. If we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the Visa and MasterCard credit card associations, Visa or MasterCard could suspend or terminate our registration with them. The termination of our registration with them or any changes in the Visa or MasterCard rules that would impair our registration with them could require us to stop providing payment processing services through our network. In such event, our business plan and/or competitive advantages in the market place would be materially adversely affected.. We rely on other card payment processors; if they fail or no longer agree to provide their services, our customer relationships could be adversely affected and we could lose business.. We rely on agreements with other large payment processing organizations, primarily Chase Paymentech, to enable us to provide card authorization, data capture, settlement and merchant accounting services and access to various reporting tools for the customers we serve. The termination by our card processing providers of their arrangements with us or their failure to perform their services efficiently and effectively may adversely affect our relationships with the customers whose accounts we serve and may cause those customers to terminate their processing agreements with us.. 21. Table of Contents. We are subject to laws and regulations that affect the products, services and markets in which we operate. Failure by us to comply with these laws or regulations would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.. We are, among other things, subject to banking regulations and credit card association regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations may result in the suspension of our business, the limitation, suspension or termination of service, and/or the imposition of fines that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Additionally, changes to legal rules and regulations, or interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a negative financial effect on us or our product offerings. To the extent this occurs, we could be subject to additional technical, contractual or other requirements as a condition of our continuing to conduct our payment processing business. These requirements could cause us to incur additional costs, which could be significant, or to lose revenues to the extent we do not comply with these requirements.. New legislation could be enacted regulating the basis upon which interchange rates are charged for debit or credit card transactions, which could increase the debit or credit card interchange fees charged by bankcard networks. An example of such legislation is the so-called \"Durbin Amendment,\" to the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The Durbin Amendment regulates the basis upon which interchange rates for debit card transactions are made to ensure that interchange rates are \"reasonable and proportionate to costs.\" Pursuant to regulations that were promulgated by the Federal Reserve, Visa and MasterCard have significantly increased their interchange fees for small ticket debit card transactions.. As of November 14, 2014, we entered into a three-year agreement with Visa U.S.A. Inc. (\"Visa\"), pursuant to which Visa has agreed to continue to make available to the Company certain promotional interchange reimbursement fees for small ticket debit and credit card transactions. Similarly, MasterCard International Incorporated (\"MasterCard\") has agreed to make available to us reduced interchange rates for small ticket debit card transactions pursuant to a three-year MasterCard Acceptance Agreement dated January 12, 2015, as amended by a First Amendment thereto dated April 27, 2015. If the foregoing agreements with Visa and MasterCard are not extended, our financial results would be materially adversely affected unless we are able to pass these significant additional charges to our customers.. Increases in card association and debit network interchange fees could increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations. If we do not pass along to our customers any future increases in credit or debit card interchange fees, assessments and transaction fees, our gross profits would be reduced.. We are obligated to pay interchange fees and other network fees set by the bankcard networks to the card issuing bank and the bankcard networks for each transaction we process through our network. From time to time, card associations and debit networks increase the organization and/or processing fees, known as interchange fees that they charge. Under our processing agreements with our customers, we are permitted to pass along these fee increases to our customers through corresponding increases in our processing fees. Passing along such increases could result in some of our customers canceling their contracts with us. Consequently, it is possible that competitive pressures will result in our Company absorbing some or all of the increases in the future, which would increase our operating costs, reduce our gross profit and adversely affect our business.. During the term of the Visa Agreement, the Company does not anticipate accepting any debit cards with interchange fees that are higher than the rates provided under the Visa Agreement. The Company will continue to accept Visa- and MasterCard- branded debit cards in addition to all major credit cards, including Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express at its current processing rates. If the Visa or MasterCard Agreements are not extended, our financial results would be materially adversely affected unless we are able to pass these significant additional charges to our customers.. The ability to recruit, retain and develop qualified personnel is critical to the Company's success and growth.. For the Company to successfully compete and grow, it must retain, recruit and develop the necessary personnel who can provide the needed expertise required in its business. In addition, the Company must develop its personnel to provide succession plans capable of maintaining continuity in the midst of the inevitable unpredictability of human capital. However, the market for qualified personnel is competitive and the Company may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors.

We incur chargeback liability when our customers refuse or cannot reimburse chargebacks resolved in favor of consumers. Any increase in chargebacks not paid by our customers may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. In the event a dispute between a cardholder and a customer is not resolved in favor of the customer, the transaction is normally charged back to the customer and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder. If we are unable to collect such amounts from the customer's account, or if the customer refuses or is unable, due to closure, bankruptcy or other reasons, to reimburse us for a chargeback, we bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder. We may experience significant losses from chargebacks in the future.
