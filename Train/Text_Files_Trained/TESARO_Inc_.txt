[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk.  You should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the information in our financial statements and the related notes, and the other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur.  These risks, or other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial, may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.. Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs. We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the future.. We are a biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history.  Investment in biopharmaceutical product development and commercialization is highly speculative because, among other things, it entails substantial up-front capital expenditures and significant risk that product candidates will fail to gain regulatory approval or approved products will fail to become commercially successful.  We have recognized limited revenue from product sales to date, and we continue to incur significant development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations.  As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in each period since our inception in 2010.  We reported a net loss of $496.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and had an accumulated deficit of $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2017.. Although we have obtained approval from regulatory authorities and launched ZEJULA® (niraparib) in the U.S. and European Union, or the EU, VARUBI® (rolapitant) IV and tablets in the United States and VARUBY® (rolapitant) tablets in the EU, we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.  These losses may increase as we continue to invest in product development and commercialization activities for our products and continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, all of our product candidates.  We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business.  The size of our future net losses will depend, in large part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses, and our ability to generate and continue to grow revenues from our products and any product candidates.  Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, including the risk that our product candidates may not advance through development or achieve the endpoints of applicable clinical trials, we are unable to predict with certainty the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability.  Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.  Our prior losses and expected future losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders' equity and working capital.. We have recognized limited revenues from sales of our products, and we may never become profitable.. To date, we have recognized limited product revenues from sales of ZEJULA and VARUBI/VARUBY, and we have not generated any revenues from sales of any other product candidates.  Our ability to continue to generate revenue and become profitable depends upon our ability to successfully commercialize our products, including ZEJULA, and our other product candidates, including niraparib in additional indications as both a monotherapy and in combination with other assets, including our own immuno-oncology assets.  Even if we are able to successfully achieve regulatory approval for additional product candidates, we do not know when any of those product candidates will generate revenue for us, if at all.. In addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, including the risk that our product candidates may not advance through development or achieve the endpoints of applicable clinical trials, we are unable to predict with certainty the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability.  Even if we are able to obtain approval for our product candidates, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing these products.. Even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of our current and future products, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations.  If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.. 31. Table of Contents. We may require additional capital to fund our operations, and if we fail to obtain necessary financing, we may be unable to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates.. Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception.  We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to advance the development of our product candidates, including niraparib as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutics, and our immuno-oncology assets, and to continue to commercialize ZEJULA and VARUBI/VARUBY.  We also may spend substantial amounts for any additional product candidates that we may acquire or in-license in the future.  We may require additional capital for these and other needs.  If additional capital is needed and not obtained on a timely basis, we would be required to change our current operating plans to reduce our future expenses.. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from our products, if ever, we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity or debt offerings and facilities, including potentially an additional draw under our existing term loan agreement, and we may seek additional capital through arrangements with strategic partners or from other sources.  Additional capital may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all.  If we are unable to raise additional needed capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our products or product candidates and/or other areas of our business.  Raising additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders, increased fixed payment obligations, or both.  Furthermore, these securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.  Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.  Our future funding requirements, both short and long-term, will depend on many factors, including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to generate sufficient revenues from sales of ZEJULA and, if approved, our other product candidates;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of continuing to expand our development and commercial capabilities for our products and our product candidates, both in the U.S. and in certain foreign markets, including Europe;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities and the potential that the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials for our current product candidates and any future product candidates we may in-license;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost and timing of preclinical and clinical development and manufacturing activities associated with our immuno-oncology antibody product candidates;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour obligations to make milestone payments, royalty payments, or both under our in-licensing agreements;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of in-licensing or acquiring additional product candidates;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights that we own or control;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe amount and timing of potential conversion requests, if any, and interest expense associated with our 3.00% convertible senior notes due October 1, 2021, or the Convertible Notes; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour need to repay amounts due under our loan agreement dated November 21, 2017, or the Loan Agreement.. Servicing our debt will require significant amounts of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt.. 32. Table of Contents. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, to pay any cash due upon conversion of, or to refinance, our indebtedness, including the Convertible Notes and borrowings under the Loan Agreement, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.  Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures.  If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.  Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time.  We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry. Our current business plan relies heavily on our ability to successfully commercialize ZEJULA.  Our products may not achieve market acceptance or be commercially successful.. Our ability to successfully commercialize our current products and product candidates, including ZEJULA as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutics, including our immuno-oncology assets, is critical to the execution of our business strategy.  Our products and product candidates may not achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, and third-party payors, and may not be commercially successful.  The degree of market acceptance and commercial success of our approved products and our product candidates, including ZEJULA as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutics, including our immuno-oncology assets, if approved, will depend on a number of factors, including the following:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe acceptance of our products by patients and the medical community and the availability, perceived advantages and relative cost, safety and efficacy of alternative and competing treatments;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe effectiveness of our marketing, sales and distribution strategy and operations;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability of our third-party manufacturers to manufacture sufficient commercial supplies of our products, to remain in good standing with regulatory agencies, and to develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are, to the extent required, compliant with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe degree to which the approved labeling supports promotional initiatives for commercial success;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of reimbursement from managed care plans and other third-party payors and the willingness and ability of patients to pay for our products;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta continued acceptable safety profile of our products and product candidates;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany new or unexpected results from additional clinical trials or further analysis of clinical data of completed clinical trials by us or our competitors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to enforce our intellectual property rights;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to avoid third-party patent interference or patent infringement claims; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to maintain compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements.. As many of these factors are beyond our control, we cannot assure you that we will ever be able to generate meaningful revenue through product sales.  Any inability on our part to successfully commercialize our products in the United States or any foreign territories where they may be approved, or any significant delay in such approvals, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to execute upon our business strategy and our future business prospects.. Our future success is dependent primarily on our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize our product candidates, including additional indications for niraparib as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutics, including our immuno-oncology assets.. 33. Table of Contents. The success of our business depends heavily upon our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates.  We have recognized only limited product revenue from sales of ZEJULA and VARUBI/VARUBY, and our only later clinical-stage programs include niraparib as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutics, including our own immuno-oncology assets.. We cannot commercialize product candidates, including niraparib in additional indications as a monotherapy or in combination with other therapeutics, in the United States without first obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA.  Similarly, we cannot commercialize product candidates outside of the United States without obtaining regulatory approval from comparable foreign regulatory authorities.  Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate, including any combination, for a target indication, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in preclinical and well-controlled clinical studies, and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the FDA, that the product candidate or combination is safe and effective for use for that target indication and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate.  The process to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize product candidates is long, complex and costly both inside and outside of the United States.  Even if a product candidate or combination were to successfully obtain approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, any approval might contain significant limitations, including use restrictions for certain patient populations; warnings, precautions or contraindications; or burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements.. Despite the results reported in clinical trials for niraparib, we do not know whether the clinical trials we are continuing to conduct or may in the future conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval for niraparib in any additional indications, as a monotherapy or in combination with other assets, or in any particular jurisdiction or jurisdictions other than those for which niraparib has already been approved.  If we do not obtain regulatory approvals for niraparib in the various additional indications and/or combinations for which it is being developed, or do not obtain such approvals in a timely manner, it would negatively affect our ability to generate revenue in the future, our ability to become profitable, and our growth prospects.. We face substantial competition for our marketed products, ZEJULA and VARUBI/VARUBY, which could limit our ability to generate significant product sales.. The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive.  Many of our competitors are more established companies and may therefore have competitive advantages due to their size, cash flows, and institutional experience.  We may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products that compete or we expect will compete with ZEJULA.  There are currently two commercially available PARP inhibitors other than ZEJULA.  AstraZeneca Plc's LYNPARZATM (olaparib) was initially approved by the FDA for use by ovarian cancer patients with a germline BRCA mutation, and was granted a new approval in August 2017 by the FDA for use as a maintenance treatment for recurrent, epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal adult cancer who are in response to platinum-based chemotherapy, regardless of BRCA status.    In February 2018, LYNPARZA received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for a new tablet formulation and a broad maintenance label, which is expected to lead to an EC marketing authorization in the near future.  In addition, Clovis Oncology, Inc.'s RUBRACATM (rucaparib) was approved in December 2016 by the FDA for use as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) associated advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies.  Clovis has filed with the FDA for expanded approval of RUBRACA as a second-line and later maintenance treatment for all women with ovarian cancer who have responded to their latest treatment with platinum chemotherapy, regardless of BRCA status, and has filed for initial approval with the European Commission as a third-line treatment in advanced ovarian cancer patients with a deleterious BRCA-mutation.  In February 2018, the CHMP communicated a positive trend vote (meaning more voted yes than no) for RUBRACA to be authorized for the treatment of a subpopulation of platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients who also harbor a BRCA mutation.  A final vote will occur at the CHMP's March 2018 meeting.  We believe there are also several additional products in clinical development targeting the PARP pathway, as detailed in Part I, Item 1, \"Business  -  Competition\".  Both LYNPARZA and rucaparib have received \"orphan drug designation\" from the EMA, which provides certain benefits including market exclusivity for up to ten years in the approved indication post-approval.  In addition to other PARP inhibitors, ZEJULA also competes with AVASTINTM (bevacizumab), Roche's angiogenesis inhibitor.  AVASTIN is FDA- and EMA-approved in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer following platinum-containing chemotherapy (platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant) and has been. 34. Table of Contents. approved by the EMA, in combination with chemotherapy, for front-line treatment.  In the U.S., it is currently under FDA review for the front-line setting.. We also face substantial competition with respect to oral and IV formulations of VARUBI and with respect to VARUBY.  VARUBI/VARUBY competes with EMEND, an NK-1 receptor antagonist marketed by Merck, as well as AKYNZEO, an oral combination NK-1 receptor antagonist and 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (netupitant plus ALOXI (palonosetron HCl)) that is marketed by Helsinn Healthcare, and Sandoz's generic version of aprepitant.  Additionally, Heron Therapeutics recently received FDA approval, and launched marketing of, its aprepitant IV formulation product, CINVANTITM.  VARUBI/VARUBY would face additional competition if additional generics are introduced to the market, or other products are developed and approved, for the treatment and prevention of CINV, or if an IV formulation of AKYNZEO is developed.. We are aware of several companies that have antibody-based products on the market or in clinical development that are directed at the same biological targets as some of our immuno-oncology programs.  There are currently two anti-PD-1 antibody products and three anti-PD-L1 antibody products being marketed.  OPDIVO® (nivolumab, marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb) is approved in a number of indications as a monotherapy or in combination with other products; KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab, marketed by Merck) is approved in a number of indications; TECENTRIQ® (atezolizumab, marketed by Roche) is approved in patients with various forms of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma or metastatic NSCLC; IMFINZI® (durvalumab, marketed by AstraZeneca) was approved in 2017 for patients with various forms of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma; and BAVENCIO® (avelumab, co-marketed by Merck KGa and Pfizer) was approved in 2017 for adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma and for patients with various forms of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.  Although there are currently no anti-TIM-3 antibody products or anti-LAG-3 antibody products being marketed, we are aware that two companies, Novartis and Eli Lilly, have anti-TIM-3 modulator antibodies in Phase 1/2 clinical development for various indications.  We are also aware of several companies that have anti-LAG-3 modulators in development for various indications, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, which has an anti-LAG-3 antibody in Phase 2 clinical development; Novartis, which has an anti-LAG-3 antibody in Phase 1/2 and Phase 2 clinical development; and Merck, Boehringer Ingelheim and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, each of which has an anti-LAG-3 antibody in Phase 1 clinical development.. For further detail on the specific competition that VARUBI/VARUBY, ZEJULA and our immuno-oncology antibody product candidates face, see Part I, Item 1, \"Business  -  Competition\".. Many of the approved drugs with which our products or product candidates may compete are well-established therapies or products and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors.  Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products.  Any of our product candidates that are approved may be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.. Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we are able to or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates.  Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more widely used and less costly than ours, and may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.. Even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.. Even after regulatory approval is obtained, products are still subject to ongoing requirements of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including requirements related to manufacturing, quality control, further development, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, import, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information.. In addition, manufacturers of drug and biological products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA, other regulatory authorities or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP requirements.  If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with a facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.. 35. Table of Contents. If we, our approved products or product candidates, or the manufacturing facilities for our approved products or product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tissue warning letters or untitled letters;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequire us to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuspend, vary or withdraw regulatory approval;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuspend any ongoing clinical studies;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; and/or. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tseize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall.. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue.. Advertising and promotion of our products and any product candidate that obtains approval in the United States will be heavily scrutinized by the FDA, the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, or the HHS OIG, state attorneys general, members of Congress, and the public.  Violations of applicable advertising and promotion laws and regulations, including promotion of our products for unapproved (or off-label) uses, are subject to enforcement letters, inquiries and investigations, and civil and criminal sanctions by the FDA.  Advertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval outside of the United States will be heavily scrutinized by comparable foreign regulatory authorities.  In the United States, engaging in impermissible promotion of approved products for off-label uses can also subject us to false claims litigation under federal and state statutes, which can lead to civil and criminal penalties and fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products.   Advertising and promotion of our products are similarly subject to close scrutiny in the EU.. Because the results of preclinical testing or clinical studies are not necessarily predictive of future results, product candidates we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval for any particular use, if at all.. Success in preclinical testing or human clinical studies does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug, or the safety, purity, and potency of an investigational biological product for any particular use, or at all.  A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including many with greater resources and experience than us, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after seeing promising results in prior clinical trials.  For example, we do not know whether the clinical trials we are currently conducting or may in the future conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety, or safety to result in regulatory approval for ZEJULA in additional indications as a monotherapy or in combination with other therapeutics, including our own immuno-oncology assets.  If we do not obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, or do not obtain such approval in a timely manner or for anticipated patient populations, it would negatively affect our ability to generate significant revenue and our growth prospects.. Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome.. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain.  Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process.  We have various ongoing clinical trials related to our development. 36. Table of Contents. programs for ZEJULA and our various immuno-oncology assets including in various combinations with each other and other assets.  We may experience delays in our ongoing or future clinical trials, and we do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin or enroll subjects on time, need to be redesigned, or be completed on schedule, if at all.  Clinical trials may be delayed, suspended or prematurely terminated for a variety of reasons, including the rate of patient enrollment, and other factors, such as:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelay or failure in reaching agreement with the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities on a trial design that we are able to execute;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelay or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelay or failure in obtaining institutional review board, or IRB, approval or the approval of other reviewing entities, including comparable foreign entities, to conduct a clinical trial at each site;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twithdrawal of clinical trial sites from our clinical trials as a result of changing standards of care or the inability of a site to participate due to prior engagement in other clinical trial programs, including some that may be for the same indication;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelay or failure in recruiting and enrolling suitable subjects and having subjects complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tambiguous or negative interim results, or results that are inconsistent with earlier results;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfeedback from the FDA, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board, or comparable foreign entities; or results from earlier stage or concurrent preclinical and clinical studies, that might require modification to the protocol for a given study;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunacceptable risk-benefit profile or unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug or biologic;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmanufacturing issues, including problems with manufacturing or obtaining from third parties sufficient quantities of raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients or product candidates for use in clinical trials; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.. If we experience delays in the completion of, or the termination of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed.  In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues.  Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.  In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.. The regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.. The time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for a product candidate is unpredictable, but typically takes many years following the commencement of preclinical studies and clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of regulatory authorities.  In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate's clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions.  Although we have obtained FDA and EMA regulatory approval for ZEJULA and VARUBI/VARUBY, we may not ever obtain regulatory approval for our current product. 37. Table of Contents. candidates or any other product candidates, including ZEJULA in additional indications, as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutics, including our immuno-oncology assets.. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require more information, including additional preclinical or clinical data or trials, to support approval, which may delay or prevent approval and our commercialization plans, or we may decide to abandon the development program.  If we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a product candidate with a label that is not desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate.  In addition, if our product candidate produces undesirable side effects or safety issues, the FDA may require the establishment of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require the establishment of similar strategies, that may, for instance, restrict distribution of our product or otherwise impose burdensome implementation requirements on us.  Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects of our product candidates, including ZEJULA in additional indications, as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutics, including our immuno-oncology assets.. Certain of our product candidates, including ZEJULA in additional indications, as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutics, including our immuno-oncology assets, could be approved or deemed approvable by the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory authorities only in combination with a diagnostic test for certain uses, which could increase the risk that the product candidate does not receive approval by the relevant regulatory authorities, or receives approval under conditions that adversely impact the commercial potential of the product candidate.. Certain clinical trials that we have conducted in the past, are currently conducting, or may in the future conduct for certain of our therapeutic product candidates, such as ZEJULA, included or may include the use of a diagnostic test to help identify patients who may be more likely to respond to the product candidate for certain uses.. If the FDA or any equivalent foreign regulatory authority determines that any of our product candidates can be approved for use only with an approved companion diagnostic test, we may have difficulty receiving regulatory approval for such product candidate in those uses if the relevant diagnostic test is not also cleared or approved for use by the applicable regulatory authority.  Diagnostic tests, including companion diagnostics, are subject to regulation by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities as medical devices and require separate regulatory clearance or approval prior to commercialization.  We do not develop diagnostic tests internally.  We are therefore dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of third-party collaborators in developing and obtaining approval for these tests.  For example, the diagnostic tests that are being utilized in our completed and ongoing ZEJULA clinical studies are owned and administered by a third party.  If clearance or approval of these diagnostic tests is required by the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory authorities, this third party may encounter difficulties in obtaining clearance or approval for the applicable tests, or may fail to support the clinical development of ZEJULA in additional indications as a monotherapy or in combination with other therapeutics, including our immuno-oncology assets, as we expect, or may fail to keep the test on the market even if it is cleared or approved.  Any such delay or failure could delay or prevent approval or adoption in additional indications of ZEJULA, or other products we may later acquire with similar characteristics.. In addition, if any product candidate is approved in a particular indication for use only in connection with such a companion diagnostic test by the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory agencies, the commercial opportunity for such product candidate may be more limited, and we may have difficulty achieving adoption of the product candidate, if the diagnostic test is not commercially available or if the diagnostic test is restricted in its use by payors or other market forces.. Any one of our products or product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent its regulatory approval, limit its commercial viability, or result in significant negative consequences following any marketing approval.. The safety profile of our products will continue to be closely monitored by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities after approval.  If we, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities become aware of new safety information about any of our products or product candidates after approval, we or those authorities may issue labeling changes, or the authorities may require the establishment of a REMS, or similar strategy, impose restrictions on a product's indicated uses or marketing, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance.  For example, in January 2018, after post-marketing events of anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, and other serious hypersensitivity reactions, some requiring hospitalization were reported to us following the commercial launch of VARUBI IV, we updated the package insert for the IV formulation of VARUBI in collaboration with the FDA to include certain warnings. 38. Table of Contents. and precautions with respect to these events.  We also issued what is commonly referred to as a \"Dear Healthcare Professional Letter\" in connection with the updates to the package insert to inform healthcare providers of these changes.  In February 2018, we determined that we would cease marketing and distribution of VARUBI IV and pursue strategic alternatives for the VARUBI brand, including potentially out-licensing the VARUBI product line.. Undesirable side effects caused by any of our products or product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, could result in a more restrictive label, or could result in the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities.  Drug-related side effects could also affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled subjects to complete a clinical trial, and could result in potential product liability claims.  Such side effects, such as those experienced with VARUBI IV following the commercial introduction of the product, could also materially limit the commercial potential for such product, especially if competing products are not associated with similar side effects.  Any of these occurrences may harm our ability to generate revenues from the affected product and adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects.. Additionally, if we or others identify undesirable side effects caused by our marketed products, such as those we have observed with VARUBI IV, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may suspend marketing of such product;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be obliged to conduct a product recall or product withdrawal;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label for such product;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be required to develop a REMS for such product or, if a REMS is already in place, to incorporate additional requirements under the REMS, or to develop a similar strategy as required by a comparable foreign regulatory authority;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be required to conduct additional post-market studies;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may record significant inventory impairment charges to write down the value of inventories to estimated net realizable value;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may experience significant product returns;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to subjects or patients; or. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour reputation may suffer.. Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product or product candidate, and could significantly harm our ability to generate revenues from sales of such product and our business, results of operations and prospects.. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad.. In order to market and sell any of our product candidates in Europe or any other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements.  The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing.  The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval.  The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval.  In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country.  We or our licensees may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all.  Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA.  We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in. 39. Table of Contents. any market.  If we are unable to obtain approval of any of our product candidates by regulatory authorities in Europe or other foreign territories, the commercial prospects of that product candidate may be diminished and our business prospects could be adversely impacted.. Our products and any product candidates we are able to commercialize may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or pricing pressure due to healthcare reform initiatives, which could harm our business.. Our ability to successfully market and commercialize our current and future products will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations.  If these third-party payors do not sufficiently cover and reimburse the cost of our products and related procedures or services or these products are considered too costly for general use, physicians may prescribe them less frequently, adversely affecting our future revenues and profitability.. The Medicare program and certain government pricing programs, including the Medicaid drug rebate program, the Public Health Service's 340B Drug Pricing Program, or the 340B program, and the pricing program under Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or the VHCA, impact the revenues we may derive from current and future products that we may commercialize.  Any future legislation or regulatory actions altering these programs or imposing new compliance requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our business. Any such measures could indirectly impact demand for pharmaceutical products because they can cause payors and providers to apply heightened scrutiny and/or austerity actions to their entire operations, including pharmacy budgets.. Also, the trend toward managed health care in the U.S., as well as the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, together the ACA, and the concurrent growth of organizations such as managed care organizations, accountable care organizations and integrated delivery networks, may result in increased pricing pressures for pharmaceutical products, including any products that may be offered by us in the future.  Moreover, legislative and regulatory changes to the ACA, including a possible repeal, remain possible under the Trump Administration.  Certain changes, such as the removal of the ACA's individual health insurance mandate, have already been made by Congress via the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and the effects of such legislative changes to the ACA are unknown.  In addition, third-party payors are increasingly making patients responsible for a higher percentage of the total cost of drugs in the outpatient setting.  This can lower the demand for our products if the increased patient cost sharing obligations are more than they can afford.  We are unable to predict what changes in legislation or regulation relating to the health care industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement, including possible repeal of the ACA, may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business.. There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement our products, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities.  Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacturing, selling and distribution costs.  Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may only be temporary.. If we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under U.S. governmental pricing and contracting programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.. We are required to calculate and report certain pricing data to the U.S. federal government in connection with federal drug pricing programs as a pre-condition to: (i) the availability of federal funds to pay for our products under Medicaid and Medicare Part B; and (ii) procurement of our products by the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the VA, and by covered entities under the 340B program.  Pharmaceutical manufacturers have been prosecuted under federal and state false claims laws for submitting inaccurate and/or incomplete pricing information to the government.  The rules governing the calculation of certain reported prices are highly complex.  Although it is our intention to maintain and follow strict procedures to ensure the maximum possible integrity for our federal price calculations, the process for making the required calculations involves subjective judgments and the risk of errors always exists, which creates the potential for exposure under the false claims laws.  We cannot assure you that our pricing submissions will not be found to be incomplete or incorrect.  Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid.. 40. Table of Contents. The Medicaid rebate amount for each manufacturer is computed each quarter based on the manufacturer's submission to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, of its current average manufacturer price, or AMP, and, in the case of innovator products like ZEJULA and VARUBI, best price figures, for the quarter.  If we become aware that our AMP or best price reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed, we are obligated to resubmit the corrected data, increasing our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid drug rebate program.  Any corrections to our rebate calculations could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction.  Price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at which we would be required to offer our products to certain covered entities, such as safety-net providers, under the 340B program.. We are liable for errors associated with our submission of average sales price, or ASP, pricing data under Medicare Part B.  In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false AMP, ASP, or best price information to the government, we may be liable for significant civil monetary penalties.  Such failure also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we participate in the Medicaid program and receive federal payments under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs.. To be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs as well as to be purchased by certain federal agencies and certain federal grantees, we also must participate in the VA FSS pricing program.  To participate, we are required to enter into an FSS contract with the VA, under which we must make our innovator \"covered drugs\" available at pricing that is based on a weighted average wholesaler price known as the Non-FAMP.  Knowing provision of false information in connection with a Non-FAMP filing or failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can subject us to substantial penalties for each item of false information as well as allegations against us under the False Claims Act and other laws and regulations.  Unexpected refunds to the government, and responding to a government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.. Our relationships with customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, exclusion, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.. Healthcare providers, specialty distributors, specialty pharmacies, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the distribution, recommendation and prescription of any pharmaceutical product for which we obtain marketing approval.  Our arrangements with third-party payors and customers are governed by applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, including the following:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal civil False Claims Act;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tanalogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsimilar restrictions imposed on the promotion and marketing of medicinal products in Europe and other foreign territories, including restrictions prohibiting the promotion of a compound prior to its approval.. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare or pharmaceutical company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements.  Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs.  If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.  Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of. 41. Table of Contents. significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our financial condition and divert resources and the attention of our management from operating our business.. Our ability to successfully commercialize our products and generate revenues outside of the U.S. depends heavily on the availability of adequate pricing and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.. Outside the U.S., certain countries, including a number of EU Member States and other European countries, set prices and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, or medicinal products as they are commonly referred to in the EU, with limited participation from the marketing authorization holders.  We cannot be sure that such prices and reimbursement will be acceptable to us or our collaborators.  If the regulatory authorities in these foreign jurisdictions set prices or reimbursement levels that are not commercially attractive for us or our collaborators, our revenues from sales by us or our collaborators, and the potential profitability and commercial viability of our drug products, in those countries would be negatively affected.  An increasing number of countries are taking initiatives to attempt to reduce large budget deficits by focusing cost-cutting efforts on pharmaceuticals for their state-run health care systems.  These international price control efforts have impacted all regions of the world, but have been most drastic in the EU.. Additionally, some countries require approval of the sale price of a product before it can be marketed.  In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted.  As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which could negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that particular country.. If we breach the license agreements for our products or product candidates, we could lose the ability to continue the development and commercialization of our product candidates.. If we fail to meet our obligations under our agreements with our licensors, including Merck, OPKO and AnaptysBio, our licensors have the right to terminate our exclusive licenses and re-obtain the licensed technology as well as aspects of any intellectual property controlled by us and developed during the period the agreements were in force that relate to the licensed technology.  This means that our licensors could effectively take control of the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates after an uncured, material breach of our license agreements by us.  This would also generally be the case if we voluntarily terminated the agreements.  While we would expect to exercise all rights and remedies available to us, including seeking to cure any breach by us, and otherwise seek to preserve our rights under the patents licensed to us, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, at an acceptable cost or at all.  Any uncured, material breach under the licenses could result in our loss of exclusive rights and may lead to a complete termination of our product development and any commercialization efforts for the applicable product or product candidate.. We may not be successful in obtaining necessary rights to additional product candidates for our development pipeline through acquisitions and in-licenses.. We generally do not intend to develop product candidates from our own original research.  Our business model is predicated, in part, on our ability to successfully identify and acquire or in-license product candidates for the treatment and support of cancer patients.  However, we may be unable to acquire or in-license any product candidates from third parties for various reasons, including because we are focusing on a specific area of care, and we may be unable to identify product candidates that we believe are an appropriate strategic fit for our company.. The in-licensing and acquisition of product candidates is a competitive area, and many more established companies are also pursuing strategies to in-license or acquire product candidates that we may consider attractive.  These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, financial resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities.  Furthermore, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us.  We also may be unable to in-license or acquire the relevant product candidate on terms that would allow us to generate an appropriate return on our investment.. In addition, we expect that competition for the in-licensing or acquisition of product candidates that are attractive to us may increase in the future, which may mean fewer suitable opportunities for us as well as higher acquisition or licensing prices.  If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to suitable product candidates, our business, financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer.. 42. Table of Contents. Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.. We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure in connection with the commercialization of ZEJULA, VARUBI/VARUBY, and any of our current or future product candidates and in connection with the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials.  Product liability claims may be brought against us by patients, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling our products, or subjects enrolled in our clinical trials.  If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities and financial and reputational harm, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsubstantial monetary awards to patients or trial subjects;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of revenue; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations.. We currently hold what we believe to be a commercially reasonable amount of product liability insurance coverage, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur.  Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive.  A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could consume significant amounts of our cash and adversely affect our business.. We market our products in certain countries and territories outside of the United States, including Europe, and are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the United States, but we have limited experience operating internationally.. We only recently initiated our operations outside of the United States, including the addition of international employees in the EU and other European countries.  Because we market ZEJULA, VARUBY, and if approved, our other product candidates, outside of the United States, we will need to continue to grow our international operations over the next several years.  Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, including our own limited experience operating internationally, the cost and time required to develop an international sales, marketing and distribution organization, changes in a specific country's or region's political, cultural or economic condition, unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations, inadequate intellectual property protection in foreign countries, difficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions, and significant adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates.. In addition to FDA and related regulatory requirements in the U.S. and abroad, we are subject to extensive additional federal, state and foreign anti-bribery regulation, which include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, and similar laws in other countries outside of the U.S.  We have developed and implemented a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are current best practices in the pharmaceutical industry for companies similar to ours, but we cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our consultants or our third-party contractors are or will be in compliance with all federal, state and foreign regulations regarding bribery and corruption.  Moreover, our partners and third-party contractors located outside the U.S. may have inadequate compliance programs or may fail to respect the laws and guidance of the territories in which they operate.  Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change,\" generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards, and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income or tax liabilities may be limited.  We have completed several financings since our inception, which we believe have resulted in a change in control as defined by IRC Section 382.  We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership.  As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to. 43. Table of Contents. limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.  In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOL carryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.. Taxing authorities could challenge our historical and future tax positions or our allocation of taxable income among our subsidiaries, and tax laws to which we are subject could change in a manner adverse to us.. We operate through various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world.  Consequently, we are subject to tax laws, treaties, and regulations in the countries in which we operate, and these laws and treaties are subject to interpretation.  We have taken, and will continue to take, tax positions based on our interpretation of such tax laws.  Our transfer pricing arrangements are not generally binding on applicable tax authorities.  The price charged for products, services, or the royalty rates and other amounts paid for intellectual property rights, could be challenged by the various tax authorities, resulting in additional tax liability, interest, and/or penalties.  There can be no assurance that a taxing authority will not have a different interpretation of applicable law and assess us with additional taxes.  If we are assessed with additional taxes, this may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or financial condition.  For further discussion related to income taxes, refer to Note 10, \"Income Taxes,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\", in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.. Any changes to existing accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may cause adverse fluctuations in our reported results of operations or affect how we conduct our business.. A change in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective.  New accounting pronouncements, taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation rules have occurred in the past and may occur in the future.  The change to existing rules, future changes, if any, or the need for us to modify a current tax or accounting position may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.. We will need to continue to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.. As of December 31, 2017, we had 715 full-time employees compared to 446 at the end of 2016.  As our development and commercialization plans and strategies for our existing products and product candidates continue to develop, we will need to continue to add managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources.  The management, personnel and systems that we currently have in place may not be adequate to support our recent or future growth.  Such growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management.. As our operations expand, we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties in both the United States and in foreign territories, including Europe.  Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our current and future products and product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage our growth effectively.  To that end, we must be able to manage our development and commercialization efforts effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management, administrative, sales, and marketing personnel.  We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company.. If we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to grow effectively.. Our future growth and success depend on our ability to recruit, retain, manage and motivate our employees.  Because of the specialized scientific nature of our business, we rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel.  Our ability to compete and grow depends in large part upon the continued service of our senior management team, including our co-founders, Leon O. Moulder, Jr., our Chief Executive Officer, and Mary Lynne Hedley, Ph.D., our President and Chief Operating Officer.  The loss of one or more of our senior executive officers could be detrimental to us if we cannot recruit suitable replacements in a timely manner.  The competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense and as a result, we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel.  Although we have letter agreements with our key executives, these agreements are at will and do not prevent them from terminating their employment with us at any time.  We do not maintain \"key person\" insurance for any of our executives or other employees.. 44. Table of Contents. In addition to in-licensing or acquiring product candidates, we may engage in future acquisitions that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders and harm our financial condition and operating results.. From time to time, we evaluate acquisition opportunities and may, in the future, make acquisitions of, or investments in, companies that we believe have products or capabilities that are a strategic or commercial fit with our current product candidates and business or otherwise offer opportunities for our company.  In connection with these acquisitions or investments, we may issue stock that would dilute our stockholders' percentage of ownership, incur debt and assume liabilities, incur amortization expenses related to intangible assets, or incur large and immediate write-offs.    We may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all.  If we do complete an acquisition, we cannot assure you that it will ultimately strengthen our competitive position, that it will not be viewed negatively by customers, financial markets or investors, or that we can effectively integrate the operations, products or personnel gained through any such acquisition without a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of our collaborators, our CROs and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures.  If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs and business operations.  For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts for our product candidates and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data.  To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed or our commercial operations could be impacted.. Our failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and adversely impact our operating results.. We are subject to U.S. data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security) at both the federal and state levels.  The legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection continues to evolve, and in recent years there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data security issues which may affect our business.  Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information.  Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (which could include civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our business.  Finally, a data breach affecting sensitive personal information, including health information, could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.. EU Member States, Switzerland and other countries have also adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations and impose substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules.  Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may interpret the various laws and regulations differently and impose additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU.  The various laws and regulations will increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new data protection rules.  Our failure to comply with these laws, or changes in the way in which these laws are implemented, could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and adversely impact our operating results.. The results of the United Kingdom's referendum on withdrawal from the EU may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.. In June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom, or the UK, elected to withdraw from the EU in a national referendum.  The UK government initiated the formal withdrawal procedure on March 29, 2017.  The procedure involves a two-year negotiation period in which the UK and the EU must agree to terms of the UK's withdrawal and arrangements for the UK's future relationship with the EU.  This negotiation period could be extended by a unanimous decision of the European Council, in agreement with the UK.  The referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between. 45. Table of Contents. the UK and the EU, including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal.  From a regulatory perspective, the UK's withdrawal could bear significant complexity and risks.  A basic requirement related to the grant of a marketing authorization for a medicinal product in the EU is that the applicant is established in the EU.  Following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, marketing authorizations previously granted to applicants established in the UK may no longer be valid.  We currently hold the European marketing authorizations for both ZEJULA and VARUBY through a subsidiary in the UK.. Depending upon the exact terms of the UK's withdrawal, the scope of a marketing authorization for a medicinal product granted by the European Commission pursuant to the centralized procedure might not, in the future, include the UK.  In these circumstances, an authorization granted by competent UK authorities would be required to place medicinal products on the UK market.  In addition, the laws and regulations that will apply after the UK withdraws from the EU would affect the manufacturing sites that hold a certification issued by the UK competent authorities.  Our capability to rely on these manufacturing sites for products intended for the EU market would also depend upon the exact terms of the UK withdrawal.. The referendum has also given rise to calls for the governments of other EU Member States to consider withdrawal from the EU.  These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets.  Any of these factors could significantly increase the complexity of our activities in the EU and in the UK, could depress our economic activity and restrict our access to capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the price of our common stock.. We derive, and may continue to derive, a substantial amount of our product revenue from a limited number of customers and the loss of one or more of these customers or a decline in revenue from one or more of these customers could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.. In the U.S., we currently sell our products principally to a limited number of specialty distributors and specialty pharmacy providers and therefore a significant portion of our net product revenue is generated by a small number of customers.  Three customers accounted for 93% of our net product revenue during 2017 and two customers accounted for 80% of our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2017.  The loss of, material reduction in sales volume to, or a significant adverse change in our relationship with any of our key wholesalers or customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue in any given period and may result in significant annual or quarterly revenue fluctuations.. Wholesaler and distributor buying patterns and other factors may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate, and these fluctuations may adversely affect our short-term results.. Our results of operations, including, in particular, net product revenues, may vary from period to period due to a variety of factors, including the buying patterns of our U.S. wholesalers and distributors, which vary from quarter to quarter.  In the event wholesalers and distributors with which we do business determine to limit their purchases, product sales could be adversely affected.  For example, in advance of an anticipated price increase or a reduction in expected rebates or discounts, customers may order product in larger than normal quantities, which could cause product sales of to be lower in subsequent quarters than they would have been otherwise.  Further, any changes in purchasing patterns, inventory levels, increases in returns, delays in purchasing products or delays in payment for products by one of our wholesalers or distributors could also have a negative impact on our revenue and results of operations.. Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties. We have no manufacturing facilities, and we are dependent on a limited number of third-party manufacturers for the manufacture and supply of ZEJULA, VARUBI (oral and IV), VARUBY and our product candidates, including our immuno-oncology assets.  If we experience problems with any of these third parties, the manufacturing of our products or our product candidates could be delayed, which could harm our ability to generate revenues from our approved products, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, and our results of operations.. We do not own or operate facilities for the manufacture of our products or product candidates.  Our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our products and our product candidates will require us to establish large scale manufacturing capabilities through our contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs.  We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities.  We currently work with two CMOs for the production of. 46. Table of Contents. ZEJULA drug substance, and one other CMO, for ZEJULA drug product supply, for our clinical and commercial needs.  We currently work with one CMO for the production of rolapitant drug substance used for VARUBI (oral and IV) and VARUBY, one CMO for commercial production of VARUBI (oral) and VARUBY, and one other CMO for commercial production of VARUBI IV.. As our drug development pipeline matures and we continue to commercialize ZEJULA and VARUBI/VARUBY and, if approved, our other product candidates, including our immuno-oncology assets, we will have a greater need for both clinical study supply and commercial manufacturing capacity.  We have limited experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products on a commercial scale, and some of our suppliers will need to continue to increase their scale of production to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing.  Manufacturing commercial quantities of our products to meet our projections may require our third-party manufacturers to invest substantial additional funds to increase capacity and to hire and retain additional personnel who have applicable large-scale commercial manufacturing experience.  Our third-party manufacturers may not successfully complete any required increase to existing manufacturing capacity in a timely manner, or at all.  Because of the complex nature of our compounds, our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture our compounds at an acceptable cost or in sufficient quantities or in a timely manner necessary to make commercially successful products, or may require us to pay significant costs, including for capital improvements to their facilities.  If our contract manufacturers or other third parties fail to deliver our products for commercial sale on a timely basis, with sufficient quality, and at commercially reasonable prices, and we fail to find replacement manufacturers or to develop our own manufacturing capabilities, we may be required to delay or suspend commercialization of our current products or other potential future products.. For development of our immuno-oncology antibody product candidates, we currently work with one CMO for the production of biologics.  For each of our product candidates, we may elect to pursue arrangements with other CMOs for manufacturing clinical supplies for later-stage trials and for commercialization.  We have not yet qualified alternate suppliers in the event the current CMOs we utilize are unable to scale production, or if we otherwise experience any problems with them.  If we are unable to arrange for alternative third-party manufacturing sources, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, we may not be able to complete development of our product candidates, or market or distribute them.. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates or products ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control (including a failure to synthesize and manufacture our product candidates or any products we may eventually commercialize in accordance with our specifications) and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us.  In addition, the FDA and similar foreign authorities require that our product candidates and approved products be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards.  Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of product candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our product candidates.  In addition, such failure could be the basis for the FDA or an equivalent foreign regulatory authority to issue a warning or untitled letter, withdraw approvals previously granted to us for our products or product candidates, or take other regulatory or legal action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, detention of product, refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunction, or imposition of civil and criminal penalties.. Any significant disruption in our supplier relationships could harm our business.  We source key materials from third parties, either directly through agreements with suppliers or indirectly through our manufacturers who have agreements with suppliers.  For example, we source key raw materials for ZEJULA drug substance from one supplier.  Such suppliers may not sell these key materials to us or our manufacturers at the times we need them or on commercially reasonable terms.  In certain cases, we do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these key materials by our manufacturers.  Any significant delay in the supply of a product or product candidate or its key materials for an ongoing clinical study could considerably delay completion of our clinical studies, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates.  If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these key materials for products or product candidates after regulatory approval, the commercial launch of our product candidates could be delayed or there could be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products and product candidates.. We rely on third parties to conduct preclinical and clinical trials.  If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize, our product candidates, and our business could be substantially harmed.. 47. Table of Contents. We have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-parties, including CROs, to execute, monitor, and manage data for our ongoing preclinical and clinical programs.  We rely on these parties for execution of our preclinical and clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities.  Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on collaborators and CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.  We also rely on these third parties to assist in conducting our preclinical studies in accordance with good laboratory practices and Animal Welfare Act requirements.  We and our collaborators and CROs are required to comply with good clinical practices, or GCP, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the competent authorities of the member countries of the EEA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our products in clinical development.  Regulatory authorities enforce GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites.  If we or any of our collaborators or CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications.  We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with GCP requirements.  Failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat preclinical and clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process and our ability to generate and grow revenues.. The individuals at our third-party collaborators and CROs who conduct work on our behalf are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical, nonclinical and preclinical programs.  If our collaborators and CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our preclinical and clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates.  As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.. Because we have relied and plan to continue to rely on third parties for the foregoing preclinical and clinical functions, our internal capacity to perform these functions is limited.  Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost, requires management time and focus, and could result in substantial delays in our development programs.  Identifying, qualifying and managing the performance of third-party service providers can be difficult, time consuming and cause delays in our development programs.  In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work and the new CRO may not provide the same type or level of services as the original provider.  If any of our relationships with our third-party CROs terminates, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or do so on commercially reasonable terms.. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed, and we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.. We depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology.  We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality, licensing and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection.  Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products.  Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the legal life of patents in the various countries.  The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage.  We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business.  The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation.  As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patents, including those patent rights licensed to us by third parties, are highly uncertain.. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, both inside and outside the United States.  The rights already granted under any of our currently issued patents and those that may be granted under future issued patents may not provide us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages we are seeking.  If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficient, our. 48. Table of Contents. competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or superior to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.  Further, under our agreement with Merck for niraparib, Merck is responsible, subject to certain exceptions, for prosecuting the licensed patents, and we are reliant on them to do so in a diligent fashion, subject to our right to review and approve their prosecution activities.  If Merck fails to conduct such activities diligently, does not take approved actions, or otherwise fails to adequately protect our licensed patent rights, we may not obtain or maintain broad proprietary protection for niraparib.. With respect to patent rights, we do not know whether any of the pending patent applications for any of our products or product candidates will result in the issuance of patents that protect our technology or products, or whether they will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products.  Although we have a number of issued patents that we own or that we license under our licensing agreements covering our technology, our pending applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications.  Further, our licensors, including Merck with respect to the licensed niraparib patents, may be responsible, subject to certain exceptions, for prosecuting the patents covering our products, and we are reliant on them to do so in a diligent fashion, subject to our right to review and approve their prosecution activities.  If they fail to conduct such activities diligently, do not take approved actions, or otherwise fail to adequately protect our licensed patent rights, we may not obtain or maintain broad proprietary protection for our products.  Further, the examination process may require us or our licensors (where applicable) to narrow the claims, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained.  As the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, issued patents that we own or have licensed from third parties may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad.  Such challenges may result in the loss of patent protection, the narrowing of claims in such patents, or the invalidity or unenforceability of such patents, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection for our technology and products.  Protecting against the unauthorized use of our patented technology, trademarks and other intellectual property rights is expensive, difficult and, may in some cases not be possible.  In some cases, it may be difficult or impossible to detect third-party infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, even in relation to issued patent claims, and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult.. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we or our licensors (where applicable) may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner.  It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of our development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them.  Further, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized.  We expect to seek extensions of patent terms where they are available in any countries where we are prosecuting patents.  This includes in the United States under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent.  However, the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request.  If this occurs, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.  Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.  The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and these foreign laws may also be subject to change.  Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature lag behind actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions typically are not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all.  Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.. Previously, in the United States, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first to make the claimed invention was entitled to the patent.  Outside the United States, the first to file a patent application is entitled to the patent.  In March 2013, the United States transitioned to a 'first to file' system in which the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent.  Under either the previous or current system, third parties will be allowed to submit prior art prior to the issuance of a patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, and may become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, post-grant review proceedings or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others.  For example, in March 2017, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. filed an opposition in the EPO seeking revocation of European Patent No. 20046464, or the '464 patent, covering the crystalline hydrochloride sale of. 49. Table of Contents. rolapitant, the active ingredient in VARUBY.  The natural term of the '464 patent is set to expire in April 2027.  In December 2017, the Opposition Division of the EPO issued a summons to attend oral proceedings on this case, which are scheduled for June 2018.  An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, which could adversely affect our competitive position with respect to third parties.. We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.. Competitors may infringe our patents or misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights.  To counter infringement or unauthorized use, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of our own intellectual property rights or the proprietary rights of others.  This can be expensive and time consuming.  Many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to defend their intellectual property rights than we can.  Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.  Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could harm our business and financial results.  In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent owned by or licensed to us is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question.  An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly.  In the U.S., the Hatch-Waxman Act provides generic companies valuable incentives to seek to invalidate patents for human pharmaceutical products approved under an NDA.  As a result, it is likely that our U.S. patents covering approved drugs such as ZEJULA and VARUBI will be challenged in Hatch-Waxman litigation and administrative proceedings, and may not be upheld.  We may face generic manufacturer challenges to our patents outside the U.S. as well.  The entry of generic competitors typically results in a rapid decline in sales.. Third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.. Our commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates, and to use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.  The patent landscape for our products and product candidates is continuously evolving due in part to the fact that patent applications in the United States and many other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for at least 18 months following their earliest filing date.  We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference proceedings before the USPTO.  Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future.  For example, we are aware of third-party patents that contain claims potentially relevant to certain therapeutic uses of immune checkpoint inhibitors, and we are also aware of ongoing litigation involving third parties in the area, in each case which could impact the development of the various assets in our immuno-oncology portfolio.  If we are found to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and commercializing our products and technology, which could impact the profitability of our products.  However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all.  Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us.  We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product.  In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be found liable for monetary damages.  A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business.  Any claims by third parties that we have misappropriated their confidential information or trade secrets could have a similar negative impact on our business.. If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.. In addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and products, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position.  We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties.  We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants.  Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches.  Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the. 50. Table of Contents. outcome is unpredictable.  In addition, some courts both within and outside the United States may be less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets.  If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position.. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock. The price of our stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.. The trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control.  From January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017, the price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ranged from $29.51 per share to $192.94 per share.  In addition to the factors discussed in this \"Risk Factors\" section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, these factors include:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe success of competitive products or technologies;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory actions with respect to our products or our competitors' products;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactual or anticipated changes in our product revenue growth rate relative to our competitors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tresults of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelopments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe results of our efforts to in-license or acquire additional product candidates or products;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncement or expectation of additional financing efforts;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe publication of inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, end of coverage, or failure to publish reports regularly on us, in each case by any securities or industry analysts who publish research on us; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic, industry and market conditions.. 51. Table of Contents. In addition, the stock market in general, and the NASDAQ Global Select Market and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies.  Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.  The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in these Risk Factors, could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.. Forecasting sales of ZEJULA, VARUBI/VARUBY, and if approved our other product candidates, may be difficult, and if our revenue projections are inaccurate, our business may be harmed and our stock price may decline.. Our sales of ZEJULA and VARUBI/VARUBY are difficult to forecast, and we expect sales of any future products would also be difficult to forecast.  Factors that increase the difficulty of forecasting sales of each of our current and future products include the following:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost and availability of reimbursement for the product;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttreatment guidelines issued by government and non-government agencies;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing of market entry relative to competitive products;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of alternative therapies;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe price of the product relative to alternative therapies, including generic versions of products that compete with our product;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe rates of returns and rebates;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tuncertainty about the pace of acceptance of the product;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability of our third-party manufacturers to manufacture and deliver the product in commercially sufficient quantities;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability of our third-party distributors and wholesalers to process orders in a timely manner and satisfy their obligations to us;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe extent and success of our marketing efforts; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning our product or similar products.. The extent to which any of these or other factors individually or in the aggregate may impact future sales of our products is uncertain and difficult to predict.  Our management must make forecasting decisions regarding future revenue in the course of business planning despite this uncertainty, and actual results of operations may deviate materially from projected results.  If our revenues from product sales are lower than we anticipate, we will incur costs in the short term that will result in losses that are unavoidable.  A shortfall in revenue would have a direct impact on our expected cash flow, our stock price and on our business generally.  Furthermore, to the extent that any projections we disclosed publicly regarding future product sales or our financial performance are incorrect, including as a result of the challenges in forecasting such sales, our stock price could be adversely affected, and we could be subject to an increased risk of litigation.  In addition, fluctuations in our quarterly results can adversely and significantly affect the market price of our common stock.. An adverse determination in any securities class action lawsuit against us could have a material adverse effect on us.. A putative class action complaint was filed on January 17, 2018 in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, entitled Roger Bowers v. TESARO Incorporated (sic), et. al., Case No. 18-10086.  The complaint alleges that we and our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer violated certain federal securities laws, specifically under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our common stock between March 14,. 52. Table of Contents. 2016 and January 12, 2018.  We believe that the allegations contained in the complaint are without merit and intend to defend the case vigorously.  However, whether or not the plaintiff's claims are successful, this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect the operation of our business.  If we are ultimately required to pay significant defense costs, damages or settlement amounts, such payments could adversely affect our operations.. We may be the target of similar litigation in the future.  Any future litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources, which could cause serious harm to our business, operating results and financial condition.  We maintain liability insurance; however, if any costs or expenses associated with this or any other litigation exceed our insurance coverage, we may be forced to bear some or all of these costs and expenses directly, which could be substantial.. Our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and are collectively able to exert significant influence over matters subject to stockholder approval.. Our executive officers, directors and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 29.7% of our voting stock as of December 31, 2017.  This group of stockholders has the potential ability to control us through their ownership position.  Acting together, these stockholders may be able to influence the outcomes of certain matters requiring stockholder approval.  For example, this group may be able to influence elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction.  This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.  The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders, and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.  We are required, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish an annual report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.  This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting.  A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also generally requires an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.. Our compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts.  We have limited experience complying with Section 404, and if in the future we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.  Furthermore, we cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future.  For example, in 2017, we began to implement an enterprise resource planning, or ERP system, which automated many of our internal controls over financial reporting.  Because the ERP is a new system and we have no prior experience with it, there is an increased risk that one or more of our financial controls may fail.  Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  If our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NASDAQ, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities.  Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.. Because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.. 53. Table of Contents. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock.  We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business.  In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends.  As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.. As of December 31, 2017, we had 54,464,039 shares of common stock outstanding.  Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other securities in the public market or in private placements could occur at any time.  These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.  Of these outstanding shares, 16,187,911 are currently held by directors, executive officers and other parties that may be deemed to be their affiliates and are available for sale subject to volume limitations and other restrictions under securities laws.  We also have registered shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans.  These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates.. Furthermore, certain persons who were stockholders prior to our initial public offering are entitled to registration rights under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Act, with respect to shares they hold, which includes 12,727,272  shares held by our directors, executive officers and other parties that may be deemed to be their affiliates.  Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in such shares becoming freely tradable without restrictions under the Securities Act, except with respect to shares purchased by affiliates.  Any sales of shares by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.. Our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.. We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.  We design our disclosure controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information we are required to disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.  We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.    These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.  Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by an unauthorized override of the controls.  Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosure due to error or fraud may occur and we may not detect them.. Future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.. We may need additional capital in the future to continue our planned operations.  To raise capital, we may sell substantial amounts of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock.  These future issuances of common stock or common stock-related securities, together with the exercise of outstanding stock options, the vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, and any additional shares issued in connection with acquisitions, if any, may result in material dilution to our investors.  Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.. Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, our compensation committee is authorized to grant equity-based incentive awards to our directors, executive officers and other employees and service providers, including officers, employees and service providers of our subsidiaries and affiliates.  As of December 31, 2017, there were 1,810,240 shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan and 198,433 shares of our common stock available for future grant under our 2015 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan.  Future stock option grants and issuances of common stock under our equity plans may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.. 54. Table of Contents. Some provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, or remove our current management.  These provisions include:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tauthorizing the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow for less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.. These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management.  Because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders.  Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction.  Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness. Despite our current debt levels, we may still incur additional debt.  If we incur substantial additional debt, these higher levels of debt may affect our ability to pay the principal of and interest on the Convertible Notes and our borrowings under the Loan Agreement.. In addition to our obligations to make payments on our existing indebtedness as discussed above, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, some of which may be secured debt.  The indenture governing the Convertible Notes and the Loan Agreement allow us to incur additional indebtedness, subject to certain limitations, and do not restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity.  If we incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, these higher levels of indebtedness may affect our ability to pay the principal of and interest on the Convertible Notes or our Loan Agreement, or to make payments under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes in connection with any fundamental change or pay any cash due upon conversion.. The conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.. In the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of notes will be entitled to convert their notes at any time during specified periods at their option.  If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, unless we satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we would be required to settle all or a portion of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity.  In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required. 55. Table of Contents. under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.. The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Convertible Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.. Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer's economic interest cost.  The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Convertible Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital caption of stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Convertible Notes.  As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Convertible Notes to their face amount over the term of the Convertible Notes.  We will report greater losses in our financial statements because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period's amortization of the debt discount and the instrument's coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the Convertible Notes.. In addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Convertible Notes exceeds their principal amount.  Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued.  We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method.  If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.. To the extent we issue shares of our common stock to satisfy all or a portion of our conversion obligation, conversions of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders.. Upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, we have the option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, either cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock.  To the extent we issue shares of our common stock to satisfy all or a portion of our conversion obligation, the conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.  Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.  In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Notes could depress the price of our common stock.. The fundamental change purchase feature of the Convertible Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our Company.. The terms of the Convertible Notes require us to offer to purchase the Convertible Notes for cash in the event of a fundamental change.  A non-stock takeover of our Company may trigger the requirement that we purchase the Convertible Notes.  This feature may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our Company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.. The terms of our Loan Agreement place restrictions on our operating flexibility.. The terms of our Loan Agreement contain customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to transfer currently owned U.S. intellectual property rights related to ZEJULA and VARUBI (the collateral under the Loan Agreement), incur additional indebtedness, incur additional liens and security interests on the collateral granted under the Loan Agreement, pay or make dividends, share repurchases and other distributions, and prepay subordinated indebtedness (other than the Convertible Notes). These terms may restrict our ability to operate our business in the manner we deem most effective or desirable, and may restrict our ability to fund our operations.. 56. Table of Contents. Nonpayment of principal, interest and other amounts, failure to comply with covenants, the occurrence of a material adverse change in our ability to perform our obligations, the rendering of judgments or orders or the acceleration or payment default by us in respect of other indebtedness in excess of $10 million, or bankruptcy could constitute an event of default that, if continued beyond the cure period, would allow the Collateral Agent, at the request of the lenders holding a majority of the outstanding principal amount under the Loan Agreement, to stop advancing money or extending credit for our benefit under the Loan Agreement and to declare all of our obligations under the Loan Agreement immediately due and payable, either of which would harm our business.. Our ability to comply with the various terms and conditions in the future may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions.. 57.
