[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. We are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to or arising out of the nature of our businesses, operations and investments, and general business, economic, financing, legal, regulatory, and other factors and conditions. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to either predict all risk factors or assess all potential impacts of any factor, or combination of factors, on BBX Capital Corporation or its subsidiaries, including with respect to their operations, results and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. BBX Capital relies on dividends from Bluegreen to fund operations.. <U+FEFF>. BBX Capital has relied and continues to rely primarily on dividends from Bluegreen in order to fund its operations and investments. Dividends from Bluegreen may not be paid to BBX Capital in the amounts previously paid or when anticipated or at all. Bluegreen paid dividends totaling $40.0 million during 2017 and $70.0 million during 2016. The payment of dividends by Bluegreen is subject to compliance with financial covenants under its credit facilities and certain of Bluegreen's credit facilities contain terms which may limit the payment of cash dividends without the lender's consent or waiver. Additionally, the payment of dividends by Bluegreen will be at the discretion of Bluegreen's board of directors.  Decisions with respect to dividends by Bluegreen are generally based on, among other things, Bluegreen's operating results, financial condition, cash flow, and liquidity needs. Dividend payments to BBX Capital by any of its subsidiaries, including Bluegreen, could, in certain circumstances, be subject to claims made by creditors of such subsidiary.. <U+FEFF>. If cash flow is not sufficient to fund BBX Capital's liquidity needs or BBX Capital otherwise determines it is advisable to do so, BBX Capital might seek to liquidate some of its investments or seek to fund its operations with the proceeds of additional equity or debt financing. Such financing may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and if BBX Capital chooses to liquidate its investments, it may be forced to do so at depressed prices.. <U+FEFF>. BBX Capital's acquisitions may reduce earnings, require it to obtain additional financing and expose it to additional risks.. <U+FEFF>. BBX Capital's business strategy includes investments in or acquisitions of operating companies, such as its acquisition of Renin and the acquisitions of businesses by BBX Sweet Holdings in the confectionery industry.  BBX Capital may also seek to make opportunistic investments outside of its existing portfolio. Some of these investments and acquisitions may be material. While BBX Capital is seeking investments and acquisitions primarily in companies that provide opportunities for growth, it may not be successful in identifying these opportunities. Investments or acquisitions that it completes may not prove to be successful or, even if successful, may not initially generate income, or may generate income on an irregular basis or over a long time period. Accordingly, our results of operations may vary significantly on a quarterly basis and from year to year as a result of acquisitions. Acquisitions and investments will also expose BBX Capital, or increase BBX Capital's exposure in the case of acquisitions of or additional investments in its portfolio companies, to the risks of any business acquired or invested in. Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDifficulties in integrating and assimilating acquired management, acquired company founders, and operations;.  \t\t\tRisks associated with achieving profitability;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe incurrence of significant due diligence expenses relating to acquisitions, including with respect to those that are not completed;.  \t\t\tUnforeseen expenses and losses;.  \t\t\tRisks associated with entering new markets in which it has no or limited prior experience;.  \t\t\tThe potential loss of key employees or founders of acquired organizations; and.  \t\t\tRisks associated with transferred assets and liabilities.. <U+FEFF>. BBX Capital may not be able to acquire or profitably manage additional businesses, or to integrate successfully any acquired businesses, including Renin, MOD restaurants and the BBX Sweet Holdings' operating businesses, without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial difficulties, including difficulties in integrating information systems and personnel and establishing control environment processes across acquired businesses. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to. 30. the extent that operating businesses are acquired outside the United States or the State of Florida, there will be additional risks related to compliance with foreign regulations and laws including tax laws, labor laws, currency fluctuations and geographic economic conditions.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, there is significant competition for investments and acquisitions, which could increase the costs associated with the investment or acquisition. Substantial costs are incurred in connection with the evaluation of potential acquisition and investment opportunities whether or not the acquisition or investment is ultimately consummated. Further, funding such investments or acquisitions may rely on additional debt or equity financing, which will subject BBX Capital to the risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors with respect to those activities in the immediately following risk factors. If BBX Capital requires additional financing in the future, the financing may not be available when needed or on favorable terms, if at all. Additionally, BBX Capital does not intend to seek shareholder approval of any investments or acquisitions unless required by law or regulation, or by BBX Capital's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, BBX Capital from time to time may consider transactions involving the sale of its subsidiaries or investments or other transactions which would result in a decrease in BBX Capital's ownership interest in its subsidiaries, and there is no assurance that any such transactions, if pursued and consummated, will generate a profit or otherwise be advantageous to BBX Capital.. <U+FEFF>. We may issue additional securities and incur additional indebtedness at BBX Capital or its subsidiaries.. <U+FEFF>. BBX Capital may in the future seek to raise funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities. There is generally no restriction on BBX Capital's ability to issue debt or equity securities which are pari passu or have a preference over its Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Authorized but unissued shares of BBX Capital's capital stock are available for issuance from time to time at the discretion of BBX Capital's board of directors, and any such issuance may be dilutive to BBX Capital's shareholders.. <U+FEFF>. Further, BBX Capital and its subsidiaries have in the past and may in the future incur significant amounts of debt, including at Bluegreen. Any indebtedness, including indebtedness incurred in the future could have several important effects on BBX Capital or its subsidiaries, including, without limitation, that BBX Capital or its subsidiaries may be required to use available cash for the payment of principal and interest due on its debt and that the outstanding indebtedness and leverage at BBX Capital or its subsidiaries will impact liquidity, and any negative changes in general economic and industry conditions will increase such impact.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen is subject to the business, financial and operating risks inherent to the vacation ownership industry, any of which could adversely impact its business, prospects and results.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen is subject to a number of business, financial and operating risks inherent to the vacation ownership industry, including, without limitation:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSignificant competition from other vacation ownership businesses and hospitality providers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tMarket and/or consumer perception of vacation ownership companies and the industry in general;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIncreases in operating and other costs (as a result of inflation or otherwise), including marketing costs, employee compensation and benefits, interest expense and insurance, which may not be offset by price or fee increases in Bluegreen's business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in taxes and governmental regulations, including those that influence or set wages, prices, interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe costs and efforts associated with complying with applicable laws and regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisks related to the development or acquisition of resorts, including delays in, or cancellations of, planned or future resort development or acquisition activities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tShortages of labor or labor disruptions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe availability and cost of capital necessary for Bluegreen and third-party developers with whom Bluegreen does business to fund investments, capital expenditures and service debt obligations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tBluegreen's ability to securitize the receivables that it originates in connection with VOI sales;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe financial condition of third-party developers with whom Bluegreen does business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRelationships with third-party developers, Bluegreen's Vacation Club members and HOAs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in the supply and demand for products and services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPrivate resales of VOIs and the sale of VOIs in the secondary market; and. 31.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tUnlawful or deceptive third-party VOI resale, cease and desist, or vacation package sales schemes, and reputational risk associated therewith.. <U+FEFF>. Any of these factors could increase costs, limit or reduce the prices Bluegreen is able to charge for its products and services or Bluegreen's ability to develop or acquire new resorts or source VOI supply from third parties, or otherwise adversely impact Bluegreen's business, prospects or results.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen's business and operations, including its ability to market VOIs, may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and the availability of financing.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen's business is subject to risks related to general economic and industry conditions and trends.   Bluegreen's results, operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by unfavorable general economic and industry conditions, such as high unemployment rates and job insecurity, declines in discretionary spending, declines in real estate values and the occurrence of geopolitical conflicts, including if these or other factors adversely impact the availability of financing for Bluegreen or Bluegreen's customers or the ability of Bluegreen's customers' to otherwise pay amounts owed under notes receivable. Further, adverse changes affecting the vacation ownership industry, such as an oversupply of vacation ownership units, a reduction in demand for such units, changes in travel and other consumer preferences, demographic and vacation patterns, changes in governmental regulation of the industry, imposition of increased taxes by governmental authorities, the declaration of bankruptcy and/or credit defaults by other vacation ownership companies and negative publicity for the industry, could also have a material adverse effect on Bluegreen's business. In addition, Bluegreen's operations and results may be negatively impacted if Bluegreen is unable to update its business strategy over time and from time to time in response to changing economic and industry conditions.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen may not be able to develop or acquire VOI inventory or enter into and maintain fee-based service agreements or other arrangements to source VOI inventory, which may cause its business and results to be adversely impacted.. <U+FEFF>. In addition to developed VOI sales, Bluegreen sources VOIs as part of its capital-light business strategy through fee-based service agreements with third-party developers and through JIT and secondary market arrangements. If Bluegreen is unable to develop or acquire resorts at the levels or in the time frame anticipated, or is unsuccessful in entering into agreements with third-party developers or others to source VOI inventory in connection with its capital-light business strategy, Bluegreen may experience a decline in VOI supply, which could result in a decrease in its revenues. In addition, a decline in VOI supply could result in a decrease of financing revenues that are generated when VOIs are sold and fee and rental revenues that are generated by Bluegreen's management services.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen's business and properties are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies. Changes in these laws, regulations and policies, as well as the cost of maintaining compliance with new or existing laws, regulations and policies and the imposition of additional taxes on operations, could adversely affect Bluegreen's business.  In addition, results of audits of its tax returns or those of its subsidiaries may have a material adverse impact on Bluegreen's financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. The federal government and the state and local jurisdictions in which Bluegreen operates have enacted extensive regulations that affect the manner in which Bluegreen markets and sells VOIs and conducts its other business operations.  In addition, many states have adopted specific laws and regulations regarding the sale of VOIs.  Many states, including Florida and South Carolina, where certain of Bluegreen's resorts are located, extensively regulate the creation and management of timeshare resorts, the marketing and sale of timeshare properties, the escrow of purchaser funds prior to the completion of construction and closing, the content and use of advertising materials and promotional offers, the delivery of an offering memorandum and the creation and operation of exchange programs and multi-site timeshare plan reservation systems. Moreover, with regard to sales conducted in South Carolina, the closing of real estate and mortgage loan transactions must be conducted under the supervision of an attorney licensed in South Carolina and otherwise in accordance with South Carolina's Time Sharing Transaction Procedures Act.  Most states also have other laws that are applicable to Bluegreen's activities, such as timeshare project registration laws, real estate licensure laws, mortgage licensure laws, sellers of travel licensure laws, anti-fraud laws, consumer protection laws, telemarketing laws, prize, gift and sweepstakes laws, and consumer credit laws.  Bluegreen's management of, and dealings with, HOAs, including Bluegreen's purchase of defaulted inventory from HOAs in connection with its secondary market sales, is also subject to state laws and resort rules and regulations, including those with respect to the establishment of budgets and expenditures, rule-making, and the imposition of maintenance assessments.. 32. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen currently is authorized to market and sell VOIs in all locations at which its marketing and sales are conducted.  If Bluegreen's agents or employees violate applicable regulations or licensing requirements, their acts or omissions could cause the states where the violations occurred to revoke or refuse to renew Bluegreen's licenses, render Bluegreen's sales contracts void or voidable, or impose fines on Bluegreen based on past activities.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, the federal government and the state and local jurisdictions in which Bluegreen conducts business have generally enacted extensive regulations relating to direct marketing and telemarketing, including the federal government's national \"do not call\" list, the making of marketing and related calls to cell phone users, a significant development in light of cell phone usage rapidly becoming the primary method of communication, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003.  These regulations, as well as international data protection laws, have impacted Bluegreen's marketing of VOIs. While Bluegreen has taken steps designed to ensure compliance with these new applicable regulations, these steps have increased and are expected to continue to increase Bluegreen's marketing costs and may not prevent failures in compliance. Additionally, adoption of new state or federal laws regulating marketing and solicitation, and changes to existing laws, could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause Bluegreen to change its marketing strategy.  If this occurs, Bluegreen may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies, which could affect the amount and timing of its VOI sales.  Bluegreen cannot predict the impact that these legislative initiatives or any other legislative measures that may be proposed or enacted in the future may have on Bluegreen's marketing strategies and results.  Further, from time to time, complaints are filed against Bluegreen by individuals claiming that they received calls in violation of applicable regulations. See \"Item 3  -  Legal Proceedings\" for a description of litigation brought against Bluegreen and Choice Hotels in January 2018 related to Bluegreen's telemarketing sales activities.. <U+FEFF>. Most states have taxed VOIs as real estate, imposing property taxes that are billed to the respective HOAs that maintain the related resorts and have not sought to impose sales tax upon the sale of the VOI or accommodations tax upon the use of the VOI.  From time to time, however, various states have attempted to promulgate new laws or apply existing laws impacting the taxation of VOIs to require that sales or accommodations taxes be collected.  Should new state or local laws be implemented or interpreted to impose sales or accommodations taxes on VOIs, Bluegreen's business could be materially adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. From time to time, consumers file complaints against Bluegreen in the ordinary course of Bluegreen's business.  Bluegreen could be required to incur significant costs to resolve these complaints or enter into consents with regulators regarding its activities, including that it may be required to refund all or a portion of the purchase price paid by the customer for the VOI.  Bluegreen may not remain in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, and violations of applicable laws may have adverse implications on Bluegreen, including negative publicity, potential litigation and regulatory sanctions. The expense, negative publicity and potential sanctions associated with any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on Bluegreen's results of operations or financial position.. <U+FEFF>. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Accessibility Guidelines promulgated thereunder (collectively, the \"ADA\"), all public accommodations, including properties, must meet various federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with the ADA's requirements could require removal of access barriers or other renovations, and non-compliance could result in the imposition of fines or penalties, or awards of damages, against Bluegreen. Bluegreen's properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. Further, various laws govern resort management activities, including laws and regulations regarding community association management, public lodging, food and beverage services, liquor licensing, labor, employment, health care, health and safety, accessibility, discrimination, immigration, and the environment (including climate change).. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen's lending activities are also subject to a number of laws and regulations, including laws and regulations related to consumer loans, retail installment contracts, mortgage lending, fair debt collection and credit reporting practices, consumer collection practices, contacting debtors by telephone, mortgage disclosure, lender licenses and money laundering. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, created under the Dodd-Frank Act, has emphasized new regulatory focus on areas of business such as consumer mortgage servicing and debt collection, credit reporting and consumer financial disclosures, all of which affect the manner in which Bluegreen may provide financing to the purchasers of VOIs and conduct lending and loan servicing operations.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, VOIs may in the future be deemed to be securities under federal or state law and therefore subject to applicable securities regulation, which could have a material adverse effect on Bluegreen due to, among other things, the cost of compliance with such regulations.. 33. <U+FEFF>. The vacation ownership and hospitality industries are highly competitive, and Bluegreen may not be able to compete successfully.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen competes with various high profile and well-established operators, many of which have greater liquidity and financial resources than Bluegreen.  Many of the world's most recognized lodging, hospitality and entertainment companies develop and sell timeshare units or VOIs in resort properties.  Bluegreen also competes with numerous smaller owners and operators of vacation ownership resorts and also faces competition from alternative lodging options available to consumers through both traditional methods of delivery as well as new web portals and applications, including private rentals of homes or apartments or condominium units, which have increased in popularity in recent years. Bluegreen's ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain customers depends on its customers' satisfaction with its products and services as well as on distinguishing the quality, value, and efficiency of its products and services from those offered by its competitors.  Customer dissatisfaction with experiences at its resorts or otherwise as a member of the Bluegreen Vacation Club owner, including due to an inability to use points for desired stays, could result in negative publicity and/or a decrease in sales, or otherwise adversely impact Bluegreen's ability to successfully compete in the vacation ownership and hospitality industries. Bluegreen may not be able to timely and sufficiently identify and remediate the cause of customer dissatisfaction. Any of these events could materially and adversely impact Bluegreen's operating results and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen's business and profitability may be impacted if financing is not available on favorable terms, or at all.. <U+FEFF>. In connection with sales of VOIs, Bluegreen generally offers financing to the purchaser of up to 90% of the purchase price of the VOI. However, Bluegreen incurs selling, marketing and administrative cash expenses prior to and concurrent with the sale.  These costs, along with the cost of the underlying VOI, generally exceed the down payment Bluegreen receives at the time of the sale. Accordingly, Bluegreen's ability to borrow against or sell its notes receivable has historically been a critical factor in Bluegreen's continued liquidity, and Bluegreen therefore has depended on funds from its credit facilities and securitization transactions to finance its operations.  If Bluegreen's pledged receivables facilities terminate or expire and Bluegreen is unable to extend them or replace them with comparable facilities, or if Bluegreen is unable to continue to participate in securitization-type transactions and \"warehouse\" facilities on acceptable terms, Bluegreen's liquidity, cash flow and profitability would be materially and adversely affected.  Credit market disruptions have in the past adversely impacted the willingness of banks and other finance companies to provide \"warehouse\" lines of credit for VOI notes receivable and resulted from time to time in the term securitization market being unavailable. Future credit market disruptions may have similar effects or otherwise make obtaining additional and replacement external sources of liquidity more difficult and costly.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, financing for real estate acquisition and development and the capital markets for corporate debt is cyclical.  While Bluegreen has increased its focus on expanding its fee-based service business and encouraging higher down payments in connection with sales, there is no assurance that these initiatives will enhance Bluegreen's financial position or otherwise be successful in the long term.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen anticipates that it will continue to seek and use external sources of liquidity, including funds that Bluegreen obtains pursuant to additional borrowings under its existing credit facilities, under credit facilities that Bluegreen may obtain in the future, under securitizations in which Bluegreen may participate in the future or pursuant to other borrowing arrangements, to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSupport Bluegreen's operations and, subject to declaration by its board of directors and contractual limitations, including limitations contained in its credit facilities, pay dividends;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFinance the acquisition and development of VOI inventory or property and equipment;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFinance a substantial percentage of Bluegreen's sales; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSatisfy Bluegreen's debt and other obligations.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen's ability to service or refinance its indebtedness or to obtain additional financing (including its ability to consummate future term securitizations) depends on the credit markets and on Bluegreen's future performance, which is subject to a number of factors, including the success of Bluegreen's business, results of operations, leverage, financial condition and business prospects, prevailing interest rates, general economic conditions, the performance of Bluegreen's receivables portfolio, and perceptions about the vacation ownership and real estate industries.. <U+FEFF>. As of December 31, 2017, Bluegreen had $19.9 million of indebtedness scheduled to become due during 2018.  Historically, much of Bluegreen's debt has been renewed or refinanced in the ordinary course of business.  However, there is no assurance that Bluegreen will in the future be able to obtain sufficient external sources of liquidity on. 34. attractive terms, or at all, or otherwise renew, extend or refinance all or any portion of its outstanding debt.  Any of these occurrences may have a material adverse impact on Bluegreen's liquidity and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, Bluegreen has and intends to continue to enter into arrangements with third-party developers pursuant to which it will sell their VOI inventory for a fee. These arrangements enable Bluegreen to generate fees from the marketing and sales services provided, and in certain cases from provisions of management services, without requiring it to fund development and acquisition costs. If these third-party developers are not able to obtain or maintain financing necessary for their development activities or other operations, Bluegreen may not be able to enter into these fee-based arrangements or have access to their VOI inventory when anticipated, which would adversely impact results.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen would suffer substantial losses and its liquidity position could be adversely impacted if an increasing number of customers to whom Bluegreen provides financing default on their obligations.. <U+FEFF>. Adverse conditions in the mortgage industry, including credit availability, borrowers' financial profiles, prepayment rates and other factors, including those outside Bluegreen's control, may increase the default rates Bluegreen experiences or otherwise negatively impact the performance of its notes receivable. In addition, in recent years, external parties have been discouraging certain borrowers from staying current on their note payments.  Although in many cases Bluegreen may have recourse against a buyer for the unpaid purchase price, certain states have laws that limit Bluegreen's ability to recover personal judgments against customers who have defaulted on their loans or Bluegreen may determine that the cost of doing so may not be justified.  Historically, Bluegreen has generally not pursued such recourse against its customers.  In the case of Bluegreen's notes receivable secured by VOIs, if Bluegreen is unable to collect the defaulted amount due, Bluegreen traditionally has terminated the customer's interest in the Bluegreen Vacation Club and then remarketed the recovered VOI.  Irrespective of Bluegreen's remedy in the event of a default, Bluegreen cannot recover the marketing, selling and administrative costs associated with the original sale, and such costs generally exceed the cash received by Bluegreen from the buyer at the time of the sale.  In addition, Bluegreen will need to incur such costs again in order to resell the VOI.  Bluegreen updates its estimate of such future losses each quarter, and consequently, the charge against sales in a particular period may be impacted, favorably or unfavorably, by a change in expected losses related to notes originated in prior periods.  In addition, defaults may cause buyers of, or lenders whose loans are secured by, Bluegreen's VOI notes receivable to reduce the amount of availability or advance rates under receivables purchase and credit facilities, or to result in an increase the interest costs associated with such facilities.  In such an event, the cost of financing may increase, and Bluegreen may not be able to secure replacement or alternative financing on terms acceptable to Bluegreen, if at all, which would adversely affect Bluegreen's earnings, financial position and liquidity.. <U+FEFF>. As described above, Bluegreen's VOI notes receivable financing facilities could be adversely affected if a particular VOI note receivable pool fails to meet certain performance ratios, which could occur if the default rate or other credit metrics of the underlying VOI notes receivable deteriorate. In addition, if Bluegreen offers financing to purchasers of VOIs with terms longer than those generally offered in the industry, Bluegreen may not be able to securitize those VOI financing receivables. Bluegreen's ability to sell securities backed by Bluegreen's VOI notes receivable depends on the continued ability and willingness of capital market participants to invest in such securities. Asset-backed securities issued in Bluegreen's term securitization transactions could be downgraded by credit agencies in the future. If a downgrade occurs, Bluegreen's ability to complete other securitization transactions on acceptable terms or at all could be jeopardized, and Bluegreen could be forced to rely on other potentially more expensive and less attractive funding sources, to the extent available. Similarly, if other operators of vacation ownership products were to experience significant financial difficulties, or if the vacation ownership industry as a whole were to contract, Bluegreen could experience difficulty in securing funding on acceptable terms. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely impact Bluegreen's business and results, including, without limitation, by reducing the amount of financing Bluegreen is able to provide to VOI purchasers, which in turn may result in a reduction in VOI sales.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, under the terms of Bluegreen's pledge and receivable sale facilities, Bluegreen may be required, under certain circumstances, to replace receivables or to pay down the loan to within permitted loan-to-value ratios.  Additionally, the terms of Bluegreen's securitization transactions require Bluegreen to repurchase or replace loans if Bluegreen breached any of the representations and warranties Bluegreen made at the time Bluegreen sold the receivables. These agreements also often include terms providing that, in the event of defaults or delinquencies by customers in excess of stated thresholds, or if other performance thresholds are not met, substantially all of Bluegreen's cash flow from its retained interest in the receivable portfolios sold will be required to be paid to the parties who purchased the receivables from Bluegreen.. <U+FEFF>. 35. Bluegreen's existing indebtedness, or indebtedness that it may incur in the future, could adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations, and the terms of Bluegreen's indebtedness may limit its activities.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen's level of debt and debt service requirements have several important effects on Bluegreen's operations.  Significant debt service cash requirements reduce the funds available for operations and future business opportunities and increase Bluegreen's vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, as well as conditions in the credit markets generally. In addition, Bluegreen's leverage position increases its vulnerability to economic and competitive pressures and may limit funds available for acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, and other general corporate purposes. Further, the financial covenants and other restrictions contained in indentures, credit agreements and other agreements relating to Bluegreen's indebtedness require Bluegreen to meet certain financial tests and restrict its ability to, among other things, pay dividends, borrow additional funds, dispose of assets or make investments. If Bluegreen fails to comply with the terms of its debt instruments, such debt may become due and payable immediately, which would have a material adverse impact on Bluegreen's cash position and financial condition. Significant resources may be required to monitor Bluegreen's compliance with its debt instruments (from a quantitative and qualitative perspective), and such monitoring efforts may not be effective in all cases. Bluegreen may also incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. If new debt or other liabilities are added to its current debt levels, the related risks that it now faces, as described above, could intensify.. <U+FEFF>. To the extent inflationary trends, tightened credit markets or other factors affect interest rates, Bluegreen's debt service costs may increase. If interest rates increased one percentage point, the effect on interest expense related to Bluegreen's variable-rate debt would be an annual increase of $2.1 million, based on balances as of December 31, 2017.. <U+FEFF>. The ratings of third-party rating agencies could adversely impact Bluegreen's ability to obtain, renew or extend credit facilities, or otherwise raise funds.. <U+FEFF>. Rating agencies from time to time review prior corporate and specific transaction ratings in light of tightened ratings criteria.  In December 2017, Standard & Poor's Rating Services affirmed Bluegreen's 'B+' credit rating.  Bluegreen's corporate credit rating is also based, in part, on rating agencies' speculation about Bluegreen's potential future debt and dividend levels.  If rating agencies were to downgrade Bluegreen's corporate credit ratings, Bluegreen's ability to raise funds on favorable terms, or at all, and Bluegreen's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. See \"Bluegreen would suffer substantial losses and Bluegreen's liquidity position could be adversely impacted if an increasing number of customers to whom Bluegreen provides financing default on their obligations\" above. In addition, if rating agencies downgraded their original ratings on certain bond classes in Bluegreen's securitizations, holders of such bonds may be required to sell bonds in the marketplace, and such sales could occur at a discount, which could impact the perceived value of the bonds and Bluegreen's ability to sell future bonds on favorable terms or at all.  While Bluegreen is not aware of any reasonably likely downgrades to its corporate credit rating or the ratings of bond classes in its securitizations, such ratings changes can occur without advance notice.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen's future success depends on its ability to market its products and services successfully and efficiently, and Bluegreen's marketing expenses have increased and may continue to increase in the future.. <U+FEFF>. As previously described, Bluegreen competes for customers with hotel and resort properties, other vacation ownership resorts and alternative lodging options, including private rentals of homes and apartments or condominium units.  The identification of sales prospects and leads and the marketing of Bluegreen's products and services to them are essential to Bluegreen's success. Bluegreen incurs expenses associated with marketing programs in advance of the closing of sales. If Bluegreen's lead identification and marketing efforts do not yield enough leads or Bluegreen is unable to successfully convert sales leads to sales, Bluegreen may be unable to recover the expense of its marketing programs and systems and its business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. In addition, Bluegreen is currently focusing and has increased its marketing efforts on selling to new customers, which typically involves a relatively higher marketing cost compared to sales to existing owners and therefore has increased and is expected to continue to increase Bluegreen's sales and marketing expenses.  If Bluegreen is not successful in offsetting the cost increase with greater sales revenue, Bluegreen's operating results and financial condition would be adversely impacted.  In addition, Bluegreen's marketing efforts are subject to the risk of changing consumer behavior. Changes in consumer behavior may adversely impact the effectiveness of marketing efforts and strategies which Bluegreen has in place, and Bluegreen may not be able to timely and effectively respond to such changes.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen generates a significant portion of its new sales prospects and leads through its arrangements with various third parties, including Bass Pro and Choice Hotels. VOI sales to prospects and leads generated by Bluegreen's marketing arrangement with Bass Pro accounted for approximately 15% and 16% of its VOI sales volume during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If this arrangement with BassPro, or any other significant. 36. marketing arrangement, does not generate a sufficient number of prospects and leads or is terminated or limited and not replaced by another source of sales prospects and leads, Bluegreen may not be able to successfully market and sell its products and services at current sales levels, at anticipated levels or at levels required in order to offset the costs associated with its marketing efforts. On October 9, 2017, Bass Pro raised an issue regarding the computation of the sales commissions paid to it on the sale of VOIs. While Bluegreen believes that the amount paid was consistent with the terms and intent of the parties' agreements, the resolution of that issue could in the future result in an increase in its marketing costs and adversely impact the Company's operating results and financial condition. The Company recognized approximately $4.8 million in selling, general and administrative expense related to this matter during the fourth quarter of 2017.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen may not be successful in maintaining or expanding its capital-light business relationships, or its capital-light activities, including fee-based sales and marketing arrangements, and JIT and secondary market sales activities, and such activities may not be profitable, which may have an adverse impact on Bluegreen's results of operations and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen offers fee-based marketing, sales, resort management and other services to third-party developers.  Bluegreen has over the last several years continued to expand its capital-light business strategy, which Bluegreen believes enables it to leverage its expertise in sales and marketing, resort management, mortgage servicing, construction management and title services. Bluegreen currently intends to continue its focus on its capital-light business activities as such activities generally produce positive cash flow and typically require less capital investment than Bluegreen's traditional vacation ownership business. Bluegreen has attempted to structure these activities to cover its costs and generate a profit.  Sales of third party developers' VOIs must generate sufficient cash to comply with the terms of their financing obligations as well as to pay the fees or commissions due to Bluegreen.  The third party developers may not be able to obtain or maintain financing necessary to meet the developer's requirements, which could impact Bluegreen's ability to sell the developers' inventory. While Bluegreen could attempt to utilize other arrangements, including JIT arrangements, where Bluegreen would utilize its receivable credit facilities in order to provide fee-based marketing and sales services, this would reduce the credit otherwise available to Bluegreen and impact profitability.  Bluegreen commenced its capital-light activities largely during the recession in response to poor economic conditions, and Bluegreen's fee-based and other capital-light business activities in the future may be adversely impacted by changes in economic conditions. While Bluegreen performs fee-based sales and marketing services, Bluegreen sells VOIs in a resort developed by a third party as an interest in the Bluegreen Vacation Club.  This subjects Bluegreen to a number of risks typically associated with selling products developed by others under its own brand name, including litigation risks.  Further, these arrangements may expose Bluegreen to additional risk as it will not control development activities or timing of development completion. If third parties with whom Bluegreen enters into agreements are not able to fulfill their obligations to Bluegreen, the inventory expected to be acquired or marketed and sold on their behalf may not be available when expected or at all, or may not otherwise be within agreed-upon specifications. Further, if these third parties do not perform as expected and Bluegreen does not have access to the expected inventory or ability to obtain access to inventory from alternative sources on a timely basis, its ability to maintain or increase sales levels would be adversely impacted.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen also sells VOI inventory through secondary market arrangements which require low levels of capital deployment.  In connection with secondary market sales, Bluegreen acquires VOI inventory from its resorts' HOAs on a non-committed basis in close proximity to the timing of when Bluegreen intends to sell such VOIs. VOIs purchased from HOAs are typically obtained by the HOAs through foreclosure in connection with maintenance fee defaults and are generally acquired by Bluegreen at a discount. While Bluegreen intends to increase its secondary market sales efforts in the future, Bluegreen may not be successful in doing so, and these efforts may not result in Bluegreen achieving anticipated results.  Further, Bluegreen's secondary market sale activities may subject Bluegreen to negative publicity, which could adversely impact its reputation and business.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen's results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted if Bluegreen does not continue to participate in exchange networks and other strategic alliances with third parties or if Bluegreen's customers are not satisfied with the networks in which Bluegreen participates or Bluegreen's strategic alliances.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen believes that its participation in exchange networks and other strategic alliances and its Traveler Plus\231 program make ownership of Bluegreen VOIs more attractive by providing owners with the ability to take advantage of vacation experiences in addition to stays at Bluegreen's resorts. A VOI owner's participation in the RCI exchange network allows Vacation Club owners to use their points to stay at over 4,300 participating resorts, based upon availability and the payment of a variable exchange fee.  During the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 8% of Vacation Club owners utilized the RCI exchange network for a stay of two or more nights.  Bluegreen also has. 37. an exclusive strategic arrangement with Choice Hotels pursuant to which, subject to payments and conditions, certain of Bluegreen's resorts have been branded as part of Choice Hotels' Ascend Hotel Collection. For a nominal annual fee and transactional fee, Vacation Club owners may also participate in Bluegreen's Traveler Plus program, which enables them to use their points to access an additional 44 direct exchange resorts, for other vacation experiences such as cruises. Vacation Club owners can convert their Vacation Club points into Choice Privileges points. Choice Privileges points can be used for stays at Choice Hotels. In addition, Traveler Plus members can directly use their Vacation Club points for stays at Choice Hotels' Ascend Hotel Collection properties, a network of historic and boutique hotels in the United States, Canada, Scandinavia and Latin America. Bluegreen may not be able to or desire to continue to participate in the RCI or direct exchange networks in the future or maintain or extend its other marketing and strategic networks, alliances and relationships. In addition, these networks, alliances and relationships, and Bluegreen's Traveler Plus program, may not continue to operate effectively, and its customers may not be satisfied with them. In addition, Bluegreen may not be successful in identifying or entering into new strategic relationships in the future. If any of these events should occur, Bluegreen's results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen is subject to certain risks associated with its management of resort properties.. <U+FEFF>. Through management of resorts and ownership of VOIs, Bluegreen is subject to certain risks related to the physical condition and operation of the managed resort properties in its network, including:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe presence of construction or repair defects or other structural or building damage at any of these resorts, including resorts Bluegreen may develop in the future;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAny noncompliance with or liabilities under applicable environmental, health or safety regulations or requirements or building permit requirements relating to these resorts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAny damage resulting from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods and windstorms, which may increase in frequency or severity due to climate change or other factors; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tClaims by employees, members and their guests for injuries sustained on these resort properties.. <U+FEFF>. Some of these risks may be more significant in connection with the properties for which Bluegreen recently acquired management agreements, particularly those management agreements which were acquired from operators in financial distress. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs as a result of any of the foregoing, Bluegreen may be subject to significant costs.. <U+FEFF>. Additionally, a number of U.S. federal, state and local laws, including the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the ADA, impose requirements related to access to and use by disabled persons of a variety of public accommodations and facilities. A determination that managed resorts are subject to, and that they are not in compliance with, these accessibility laws could result in a judicial order requiring compliance, imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. If one of Bluegreen's managed resorts was required to make significant improvements as a result of non-compliance with these accessibility laws, assessments might be needed to fund such improvements, which additional costs may cause its VOI owners to default on their consumer loans from Bluegreen or cease making required maintenance fee or assessment payments. Also, to the extent that Bluegreen holds interests in a particular resort, it would be responsible for the pro rata share of the costs of such improvements. In addition, any new legislation may impose further burdens or restrictions on property owners with respect to access by disabled persons.. <U+FEFF>. The resort properties that Bluegreen manages are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, natural resources and worker health and safety, including laws and regulations governing and creating liability relating to the management, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and other regulated materials and the cleanup of contaminated sites. The resorts are also subject to various environmental laws and regulations that govern certain aspects of their ongoing operations. These laws and regulations control such things as the nature and volume of wastewater discharges, quality of water supply and waste management practices. To the extent that Bluegreen holds interests in a particular resort, it would be responsible for the pro rata share of losses sustained by such resort as a result of a violation of any such laws and regulations.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, Bluegreen may from time to time have disagreements with VOI owners and HOAs resulting from its provision of management services. Failure to resolve such disagreements may result in litigation. Further, disagreements with HOAs could also result in the loss of management contracts, which would negatively affect Bluegreen's revenues and results and may also have an adverse impact on its ability to generate sales from existing VOI owners.. <U+FEFF>. 38. Bluegreen's management contracts are typically structured as \"cost-plus,\" with an initial term of three years and automatic one-year renewals. If a management contract is terminated or not renewed on favorable terms or is renegotiated in a manner adverse to Bluegreen, its revenues and cash flows would be adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. Maintenance fees at Bluegreen's resorts and/or Vacation Club dues may be required to be increased, which could cause its product to become less attractive and could harm business.. <U+FEFF>. The maintenance fees, special assessments and Vacation Club dues that are levied by HOAs and the Vacation Club on VOI owners may increase as the costs to maintain and refurbish properties, and to keep properties in compliance with Bluegreen's standards, increase. Increases in such fees, assessments or dues could negatively affect customer satisfaction with Bluegreen's Vacation Club or otherwise adversely impact VOI sales to both new customers and existing VOI owners.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen's strategic transactions may not be successful and may divert its management's attention and consume significant resources.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen intends to continue its strategy of selectively pursuing complementary strategic transactions. Bluegreen may also purchase management contracts, including from resort operators facing financial distress, and purchase VOI inventory at resorts that it does not manage, with the goal of acquiring sufficient VOI ownership at such a resort to become the manager of that resort. The successful execution of this strategy will depend on Bluegreen's ability to identify and enter into the agreements necessary to take advantage of these potential opportunities, and to obtain any necessary financing. Bluegreen may not be able to do so successfully. In addition, Bluegreen's management may be required to devote substantial time and resources to pursue these opportunities, which may impact their ability to manage its operations effectively.. <U+FEFF>. Acquisitions involve numerous additional risks, including: (i) difficulty in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business or assets; (ii) potential disruption of ongoing business and the distraction of management from day-to-day operations; (iii) difficulty entering markets in which Bluegreen has limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have a stronger market position; (iv) difficulty maintaining the quality of services that Bluegreen has historically provided across new acquisitions; (v) potential legal and financial responsibility for liabilities of the acquired business or assets; (vi) potential overpayment for the acquired business or assets; (vii) increased expenses associated with completing an acquisition and amortizing any acquired intangible assets; (viii) risks associated with any debt incurred in connection with the financing of the transaction; and (ix) challenges in implementing uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies throughout an acquired business.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen is dependent on the managers of its affiliated resorts to ensure that those properties meet its customers' expectations.. <U+FEFF>. In addition to stays at Bluegreen resorts, Vacation Club owners have access to other resorts and hotels as a result of participation in exchange programs and other strategic alliances. Accordingly, Vacation Club owners have access to resorts that Bluegreen does not manage, own or operate. If the managers of a significant number of those properties were to fail to maintain them in a manner consistent with Bluegreen's standards of quality, Bluegreen may be subject to customer complaints and its reputation and brand could be damaged. In addition, Bluegreen's agreements with these resorts or their owners may expire, be terminated or not be renewed, or may be renegotiated in a manner adverse to Bluegreen, and Bluegreen may be unable to enter into new agreements that provide Vacation Club owners with equivalent access to additional resorts, any or all of which could materially adversely impact Bluegreen's business, operating results and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. The resale market for VOIs could adversely affect Bluegreen's business.. <U+FEFF>. Based on Bluegreen's experience at its resorts and at resorts owned by third parties, Bluegreen believes that resales of VOIs in the secondary market generally are made at net sales prices below the original customer purchase prices.  The relatively lower sales prices are partly attributable to the high marketing and sales costs associated with the initial sales of such VOIs.  Accordingly, the initial purchase price of a VOI may be less attractive to prospective buyers, and Bluegreen competes with buyers who seek to resell their VOIs.  While VOI resale clearing houses or brokers currently do not have a material impact on Bluegreen's business, the availability of resale VOIs at lower prices, particularly if an organized and liquid secondary market develops, could adversely affect Bluegreen's level of sales and sales prices, which in turn would adversely affect Bluegreen's business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. 39. Bluegreen is subject to the risks of the real estate market and the risks associated with real estate development, including a decline in real estate values and a deterioration of other conditions relating to the real estate market and real estate development.. <U+FEFF>. Real estate markets are cyclical in nature and highly sensitive to changes in national and regional economic conditions, including:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tLevels of unemployment;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tLevels of discretionary disposable income;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tLevels of consumer confidence;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe availability of financing;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOverbuilding or decreases in demand;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tInterest rates; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFederal, state and local taxation methods.. <U+FEFF>. A deterioration in general economic conditions or in the real estate market would have a material adverse effect on Bluegreen's business.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen expects to seek to acquire more real estate inventory in the future, and the availability of land for development of resort properties at favorable prices will be critical to Bluegreen's profitability and the ability to cover its significant selling, general and administrative expenses, cost of capital and other expenses.  If Bluegreen is unable to acquire such land or resort properties at a favorable cost, Bluegreen's results of operations may be materially, adversely impacted. The profitability of Bluegreen's real estate development activities is also impacted by the cost of construction, including the costs of materials and labor and other services. Should the cost of construction materials and services rise, the ultimate cost of Bluegreen's future resorts inventory when developed could increase and have a material, adverse impact on Bluegreen's results of operations. Bluegreen is also exposed to other risks associated with development activities, including, without limitation:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAdverse conditions in the capital markets may limit Bluegreen's ability to raise capital for completion of projects or for development of future properties;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tConstruction delays, zoning and other local, state or federal governmental approvals, cost overruns, lender financial defaults, or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, volcanic eruptions and oil spills, increasing overall construction costs, affecting timing of project completion or resulting in project cancellations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAny liability or alleged liability or resulting delays associated with latent defects in design or construction of projects Bluegreen has developed or that Bluegreen constructs in the future adversely affecting Bluegreen's business, financial condition and reputation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFailure by third-party contractors to perform for any reason, exposing Bluegreen to operational, reputational and financial harm; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe existence of any title defects in properties Bluegreen acquires.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, the third-party developers from whom Bluegreen sources VOI inventory as part of its capital-light business strategy are exposed to such development-related risks and, therefore, the occurrence of such risks may adversely impact its ability to acquire VOI inventory from them when expected or at all.. <U+FEFF>. Environmental liabilities, including claims with respect to mold or hazardous or toxic substances, could have a material adverse impact on Bluegreen's financial condition and operating results.. <U+FEFF>. Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, as well as common law, Bluegreen may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances, including mold, located on, in or emanating from property that Bluegreen owns, leases or operates, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage at such property.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether Bluegreen knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect Bluegreen's ability to sell or lease its property or to borrow money using such property or receivables generated from the sale of such property as collateral.  Noncompliance with environmental, health or safety requirements may require Bluegreen to cease or alter operations at one or more of its properties.  Further, Bluegreen may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from violations of environmental regulations or from contamination associated with one or more of Bluegreen's properties.. 40. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen's insurance policies may not cover all potential losses.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen maintains insurance coverage for liability, property and other risks with respect to its operations and activities. While Bluegreen has comprehensive property and liability insurance policies with coverage features and insured limits that it believes are customary, market forces beyond Bluegreen's control may limit the scope of the insurance coverage it can obtain or ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates. The cost of insurance may increase and coverage levels may decrease, which may affect Bluegreen's ability to maintain customary insurance coverage and deductibles at acceptable costs. There is a limit as well as various sub-limits on the amount of insurance proceeds Bluegreen will receive in excess of applicable deductibles. If an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of its properties, the claims from each affected property may be considered together per policy provisions to determine whether the per occurrence limit, annual aggregate limit or sub-limits, depending on the type of claim, have been reached. If the limits or sub-limits are exceeded, each affected property may only receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy. Further, certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, terrorist acts, and certain environmental matters, may be outside the general coverage limits of Bluegreen's policies, subject to large deductibles, deemed uninsurable or too cost-prohibitive to justify insuring against. In addition, in the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage Bluegreen carries may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of the affected resort or in some cases may not provide a recovery for any part of a loss. As a result, Bluegreen could lose some or all of the capital it has invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future marketing, sales or revenue opportunities from the property. Further, Bluegreen could remain obligated under guarantees or other financial obligations related to the property despite the loss of product inventory, and its VOI owners could be required to contribute toward deductibles to help cover losses.. <U+FEFF>. Adverse outcomes in legal or other regulatory proceedings, including claims of non-compliance with applicable regulations or development-related defects could adversely affect Bluegreen's financial condition and operating results.. <U+FEFF>. In the ordinary course of business, Bluegreen is subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which result in significant expenses and devotion of time. In addition, litigation is inherently uncertain, and adverse outcomes in the litigation and other proceedings to which Bluegreen is or may be subject could adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. In addition, liabilities related to Bluegreen's former Bluegreen Communities business that were not assumed by Southstar Development Partners, Inc. (\"Southstar\") in connection with Southstar's purchase of substantially all of the assets which comprised Bluegreen Communities during May 2012, including those relating to Bluegreen Communities' operations prior to the closing of the transaction, remain Bluegreen's responsibility.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen engages third-party contractors to construct its resorts. Bluegreen also historically engaged third-party contractors to develop the communities within its former Bluegreen Communities business.  However, Bluegreen's customers may assert claims against Bluegreen for construction defects or other perceived development defects, including, without limitation, structural integrity, the presence of mold as a result of leaks or other defects, water intrusion, asbestos, electrical issues, plumbing issues, road construction, water and sewer defects and defects in the engineering of amenities. In addition, certain state and local laws may impose liability on property developers with respect to development defects discovered in the future.  Bluegreen could have to accrue a significant portion of the cost to repair such defects in the quarter when such defects arise or when the repair costs are reasonably estimable.. <U+FEFF>. Costs associated with litigation, including claims for development-related defects, and the outcomes thereof could adversely affect Bluegreen's liquidity, financial condition and operating results.. <U+FEFF>. Failure to maintain the integrity of Bluegreen's internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions or operational inefficiencies, damage Bluegreen's reputation and/or subject Bluegreen to costs, fines, or lawsuits.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen collects and retains large volumes of internal and customer data, including social security numbers, credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of its customers in various internal information systems and information systems of its service providers. Bluegreen also maintains personally identifiable information about its employees. The integrity and protection of that customer, employee and company data is critical to Bluegreen and faulty decisions could be made if that data is inaccurate or incomplete. Bluegreen's customers and employees also have a high expectation that Bluegreen and its service providers will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment as well as the requirements imposed on Bluegreen by the payment card industry surrounding information, security and privacy is also increasingly demanding, in both the United States and other jurisdictions in which Bluegreen operates. Bluegreen's systems may be unable to satisfy changing regulatory and. 41. payment card industry requirements and employee and customer expectations, or may require significant additional investments or time in order to do so.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen's information systems and records, including those it maintains with its service providers, may be subject to security breaches, cyber attacks, system failures, viruses, operator error or inadvertent releases of data. A significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, employee or company data maintained by Bluegreen or by a service provider could adversely impact Bluegreen's reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses, fines or litigation. A breach in the security of Bluegreen's information systems or those of its service providers could lead to an interruption in the operation of Bluegreen's systems, resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits.. <U+FEFF>. The proliferation and global reach of social media continues to expand rapidly and could cause Bluegreen to suffer reputational harm. The continuing evolution of social media presents new challenges and requires it to keep pace with new developments, technology and trends. Negative posts or comments about Bluegreen, the properties it manages or its brands on any social networking or user-generated review website, including travel and vacation property websites, could affect consumer opinions of Bluegreen and its products, and Bluegreen cannot guarantee that it will timely or adequately redress such instances. Inadequate or failed technologies could lead to interruptions in Bluegreen's operations, which may materially adversely affect its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, conversions to new information technology systems require effective change management processes and may result in cost overruns, delays or business interruptions. If Bluegreen's information technology systems are disrupted, become obsolete or do not adequately support its strategic, operational or compliance needs, its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen's technology requires updating, the cost involved in updating the technology may be significant, and the failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair Bluegreen's operations or competitive position.. <U+FEFF>. The vacation ownership and hospitality industries require the utilization of technology and systems, including technology utilized for sales and marketing, mortgage servicing, property management, brand assurance and compliance, and reservation systems. This technology requires continuous updating and refinements, including technology required to remain competitive and to comply with the legal requirements such as privacy regulations and requirements established by third parties. Bluegreen is taking steps to update its information technology platform, which has required, and is likely to continue to require, significant capital expenditures. Older systems which have not yet been updated may increase the risk of operational inefficiencies, financial loss and non-compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, and Bluegreen may not be successful in updating such systems in the time frame or at the cost anticipated. Further, as a result of the rapidly changing technological environment, systems which Bluegreen has put in place or expects to put in place in the near term may become outdated, requiring new technology, and Bluegreen may not be able to replace those systems as quickly as its competition or within budgeted costs and time frames.  Further, Bluegreen may not achieve the benefits that may have been anticipated from any new technology or system.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen's intellectual property rights, and the intellectual property rights of its business partners, are valuable, and the failure to protect those rights could adversely affect its business.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen's intellectual property rights, including existing and future trademarks, trade secrets and copyrights, are and will continue to be valuable and important assets of its business. Bluegreen believes that its proprietary technology, as well as its other technologies and business practices, are competitive advantages and that any duplication by competitors would harm Bluegreen's business. Measures taken to protect Bluegreen's intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. Additionally, intellectual property laws and contractual restrictions may not prevent misappropriation of Bluegreen's intellectual property. Finally, even if Bluegreen is able to successfully protect its intellectual property, others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to Bluegreen's technology. Bluegreen also generates a significant portion of new sales prospects and leads through arrangements with third parties, including Bass Pro. The failure by these third parties to protect their intellectual property rights could also harm Bluegreen's business.. <U+FEFF>. The loss of the services of Bluegreen's key management and personnel could adversely affect its business.. <U+FEFF>. Bluegreen's ability to successfully implement its business strategy will depend on its ability to attract and retain experienced and knowledgeable management and other professional staff, and Bluegreen may not be successful in doing so. If efforts to retain and attract key management and other personnel are unsuccessful, Bluegreen's business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted.. 42. <U+FEFF>. BBX Capital and its subsidiaries are subject to environmental laws related to their real estate activities and the cost of compliance could adversely affect our businesses.. <U+FEFF>. As current or previous owners or operators of real property, BBX Capital and its subsidiaries, including Bluegreen, may be liable under federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in the property. These laws often impose liability whether or not we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The cost of investigating, remediating or removing such hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial.. <U+FEFF>. In connection with the sale of BankAtlantic to BB&T during July 2012, we acquired nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate, and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if these criticized assets are monetized below their current book values.. <U+FEFF>. As a result of the BankAtlantic Sale, we maintain and manage a portfolio of foreclosed real estate and non-performing loans. As a consequence, our financial condition and results of operations will be dependent on our ability to successfully manage and monetize these legacy assets. Further, our loan portfolio and real estate may not be easily salable in the event we decide to liquidate an asset through a sale transaction. If the legacy assets are not monetized at or near the current book values ascribed to them, or if these assets are liquidated for amounts less than book value, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.  Because a majority of these legacy assets do not generate income on a regular basis, we do not expect to generate significant revenue or income with respect to these assets until such time as an asset is monetized through repayments or we consummate transactions involving the sale, joint venture or development of the underlying real estate or investments.. <U+FEFF>. Some of our operations are through unconsolidated joint ventures with unaffiliated third parties, and we may be adversely impacted by a joint venture partner's failure to fulfill its obligations.. <U+FEFF>. By entering into joint ventures, we may be successful in reducing the amount we invest in the ownership and development of real estate properties. However, joint venture partners may become financially unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture agreements. Most joint ventures borrow money to help finance their activities, and although recourse on the loans is generally limited to the managing members, joint ventures and their properties, we have in some cases and may in the future provide ongoing financial support or guarantees. If joint venture partners do not meet their obligations to the joint venture, we may be required to make significant expenditures, which may have an adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. We have in the past and may in the future hold investments in a number of different joint ventures with the same or related developers, which could increase the adverse effects of any failures by such developer to fulfil its obligations.. <U+FEFF>. Investments by BBX Capital's real estate division in real estate developments directly or through joint ventures expose us to market and economic risks inherent in the real estate construction and development industry.. <U+FEFF>. The real estate construction and development industry is highly competitive and subject to numerous risks which in many cases are beyond management's control. The success of our investments in real estate developments is dependent on many factors, including:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDemand for or oversupply of new homes, finished lots, rental apartments and commercial real estate;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDemand for commercial real estate tenants;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tReal estate market values;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in capitalization rates impacting real estate values;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tInventory of foreclosed homes negatively impacting selling prices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAvailability and reasonable pricing of skilled labor;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAvailability and reasonable pricing of construction materials, such as lumber, framing, concrete and other building materials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in laws and regulations for new construction and land entitlements, including environmental and zoning laws and regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tNatural disasters and severe weather conditions increasing costs, delaying construction, causing uninsured losses or reducing demand for new homes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAvailability and cost of mortgage financing for potential purchasers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tMortgage loan interest rates;. 43.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAvailability, delays and costs associated with obtaining permits, approvals or licenses necessary to develop property;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tConstruction defects and product liability claims; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tGeneral economic conditions.. <U+FEFF>. Any of these factors could give rise to delays in the start or completion of a project, increase the cost of developing a project, or could result in reduced prices and values for BBX Capital's developments, including developments underlying its joint venture investments.. <U+FEFF>. A significant portion of our loans and real estate assets are located in Florida, and economic conditions in the Florida real estate market could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. The legacy assets retained by us in the BankAtlantic Sale and the real estate investments made by us are primarily in Florida, and adverse changes to the Florida economy or the real estate market may negatively impact our earnings and financial condition. Our real estate investment business is primarily concentrated in Florida. As a result, we are exposed to geographic risks of high unemployment rates, declines in the housing industry and declines in the real estate market in Florida. Adverse changes in laws and regulations 'in Florida would have a negative impact on our revenues, financial condition and business. Declines in the Florida housing markets may negatively impact the credit performance of our loans and result in significant asset impairments. Further, the State of Florida is subject to the risks of natural disasters, such as tropical storms and hurricanes, which may disrupt our operations, adversely impact the ability of our borrowers to timely repay their loans, adversely impact the value of any collateral securing loans and our portfolio of real estate, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations. The severity and impact of tropical storms, hurricanes and other weather related events are unpredictable.. <U+FEFF>. Renin's sales are concentrated with two significant customers, and there is significant competition in the industry.. <U+FEFF>. A significant amount of Renin's sales are to big-box home centers. These home centers in many instances have significant negotiating leverage with their vendors, including Renin, and are able to affect the prices of the products sold and the terms and conditions of conducting business with them.  These home centers may also reduce the number of vendors they purchase from or make significant changes in their volume of purchases. Although homebuilders, dealers and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for Renin's products, the loss of a home center customer or reduced sales volume at any of these home centers would have a material adverse effect on Renin's business. Further, Renin has substantial competition from overseas manufacturers of products similar to those sold by Renin.. <U+FEFF>. A significant portion of Renin's business relies on home improvement and new home construction activity, both of which are cyclical and outside of management's control.. <U+FEFF>. A significant portion of Renin's business is dependent on the levels of home improvement activity, including spending on repair and remodeling projects, and new home construction activity. Macroeconomic conditions, including consumer confidence levels, fluctuations in home prices, unemployment and underemployment levels, interest rates, regulatory initiatives, and the availability of home equity loans and mortgage financing affect both discretionary spending on home improvement projects as well as new home construction activity. Adverse changes in these factors or uncertainty regarding these macroeconomic conditions could result in a decline in spending on home improvement projects and a decline in demand for new home construction, both of which could adversely affect Renin's results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. The operating results of Renin and BBX Sweet Holdings would be negatively impacted if they experience increased commodity costs or a limited availability of commodities.. <U+FEFF>. Our middle market operating businesses purchase various commodities to manufacture products, including steel, aluminum, glass and mirror in the case of Renin, and sugar and cocoa in the case of BBX Sweet Holdings. Fluctuations in the availability and prices of these commodities could increase the cost to manufacture products. Further, increases in energy costs could increase production costs as well as transportation costs, each of which could negatively affect their operating results.  Renin's and BBX Sweet Holdings' existing arrangements with customers, competitive considerations and the relative negotiating power and resistance of home center customers and big-box retailers to price increases make it difficult to increase selling prices to absorb increased production costs. If Renin and BBX Sweet Holdings are not able to increase the prices of its products or achieve other cost savings or productivity improvements to offset any increased commodity and production costs, our operating results could be negatively impacted. Many of the raw materials purchased by Renin and BBX Sweet Holdings are sourced from China, Mexico. 44. and other countries.  Changes in United States trade practices, or taxes levied on these imports, could significantly impact the results of these operating companies.. <U+FEFF>. Market demand for chocolate and candy products could decline.. <U+FEFF>. BBX Sweet Holdings and its acquired businesses operate in highly competitive markets and compete with larger companies that have greater resources. The success of these businesses is impacted by many factors, including the following:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tEffective retail execution;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tEffective and cost efficient advertising campaigns and marketing programs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAdequate supply of commodities at a reasonable cost;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOversight of product safety;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAbility to sell manufactured products at competitive prices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tResponse to changes in consumer preferences and tastes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in consumer health concerns, including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients and;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tConcerns related to effects of sugar or other ingredients which may be used to make its products.. <U+FEFF>. A decline in market demand for chocolate and candy products could negatively affect operating results.. <U+FEFF>. BBX Sweet Holdings may experience product recalls or product liability claims.. <U+FEFF>. Selling products for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks, including product contamination, spoilage, product tampering, allergens, or other adulteration. BBX Sweet Holdings could decide or be required to destroy inventory, recall products or lose sales in connection with contamination, tampering, adulteration or other deficiencies. These events could result in significant losses and may damage BBX Sweet Holdings' reputation, and discourage consumers from buying products, or cause production and delivery disruptions which would adversely affect BBX Sweet Holdings' financial condition and results of operations.  BBX Sweet Holdings may also incur losses if products cause injury, illness or death. A significant product liability claim may adversely affect both reputation and profitability, even if the claim is unsuccessful.. <U+FEFF>. FFTRG operations require ongoing compliance with its area development and franchise agreements with MOD.. <U+FEFF>. The Company's area development agreement with MOD provides the Company with the exclusive right to open MOD franchised pizza restaurant locations in the state of Florida. The agreement requires the Company to open its restaurant locations based on a predetermined development schedule, and failure to comply with the schedule gives MOD the right to terminate the agreement. In connection with such a termination, the Company will have no right to open additional MOD franchised pizza restaurant locations, and MOD may grant franchise rights to competitors in the state of Florida. As a result, to remain compliant with the development schedule, the Company may decide to develop restaurants in less desirable locations. Furthermore, if the Company lost its exclusive development rights, our inability to open additional locations could prevent us from scaling our infrastructure and operations, and our existing locations may face increased competition from additional MOD locations.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, the Company's franchise agreements with MOD require the Company to comply with various operating programs designed and established by MOD. These programs include the adoption of price discounts and promotions, the implementation of menu changes, and the funding of various ongoing operating expenses and capital expenditures, including the requirement to periodically remodel restaurant locations.. <U+FEFF>. These requirements and the related risks of compliance could ultimately have an adverse effect on the operating results of the Company's MOD franchise operations.. <U+FEFF>. Information technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.. <U+FEFF>. The Company relies on information technology (IT) systems, including Internet sites, data hosting facilities and other hardware and platforms, some of which are hosted by third parties. These IT systems, like those of most companies, may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, telecommunications failures, hackers, and other security issues. Moreover, the Company's computer systems, like those of most companies, may become subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, and to cyber or phishing-attacks. Although administrative and technical controls have been implemented which attempt to minimize the risk of cyber. 45. incidents, computer intrusion efforts are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and any enhanced controls installed might be breached. If the IT systems cease to function properly, the Company could suffer interruptions in its operations. If the cyber-security is breached, unauthorized persons may gain access to our proprietary or confidential information, including information about borrowers, employees or investments. This could require the Company to incur significant costs to comply with legally required protocols and to repair or restore the security of its systems.. <U+FEFF>. Substantial sales of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock could adversely affect the market prices of such securities.. <U+FEFF>. Substantial sales of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, including sales of shares by controlling shareholders and management, could adversely affect the market prices of such securities. Management has in the past and may in the future enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans pursuant to which a significant number of shares are sold into the open market.. <U+FEFF>. Alan B. Levan and John E. Abdo's control position may adversely affect the market price of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.. <U+FEFF>. Alan B. Levan, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BBX Capital, and John E. Abdo, the Vice Chairman of BBX Capital, collectively beneficially own shares of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representing approximately 77% of the general voting power of BBX Capital. In addition, each of Mr. Alan Levan and Mr. Abdo has been granted restricted securities of BBX Capital which are scheduled to vest over time. Further, Mr. Alan Levan and Mr. Abdo are parties to an agreement pursuant to which Mr. Alan Levan has agreed to vote his shares of BBX Capital's Class B Common Stock in favor of the election of Mr. Abdo to BBX Capital's board of directors for so long as he is willing and able to serve as a director of BBX Capital, and Mr. Abdo has agreed to vote the shares of BBX Capital's Class B Common Stock he owns in the same manner that Mr. Alan Levan votes his shares of BBX Capital's Class B Common Stock. Mr. Abdo has also agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to transfer certain of his shares of BBX Capital's Class B Common Stock and to obtain the consent of Mr. Alan Levan prior to the conversion of certain of his shares of BBX Capital's Class B Common Stock into shares of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock. Because BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock vote as a single class on most matters, Mr. Alan Levan and Mr. Abdo effectively have the voting power to elect the members of BBX Capital's board of directors and to control the outcome of any other vote of BBX Capital's shareholders, except in those limited circumstances where Florida law mandates that the holders of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock vote as a separate class. Mr. Alan Levan's and Mr. Abdo's control position may have an adverse effect on the market price of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. In addition, their interests may conflict with the interests of BBX Capital's other shareholders.. <U+FEFF>. Provisions in BBX Capital's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as BBX Capital's shareholder rights plan, may make it difficult for a third party to acquire BBX Capital and could impact the price of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.. <U+FEFF>. BBX Capital's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that could delay, defer or prevent a change of control of BBX Capital or its management. These provisions could make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock. These provisions include:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe provisions in BBX Capital's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation regarding the special voting rights of BBX Capital 's Class B Common Stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSubject to the special class voting rights of holders of BBX Capital's Class B Common Stock under certain circumstances, the authority of BBX Capital's board of directors to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock and to fix the relative rights and preferences of the preferred stock without additional shareholder approval; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAdvance notice procedures to be complied with by shareholders in order to make shareholder proposals or nominate directors.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, BBX Capital's rights agreement, which was adopted and is designed to preserve certain tax benefits available to BBX Capital, may have an anti-takeover effect because the rights agreement provides a deterrent to investors from acquiring a 5% or greater ownership interest in BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.. <U+FEFF>. 46. Holders of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock may not receive dividends in the amounts anticipated, when anticipated, or at all.. <U+FEFF>. During each of March 2017, June 2017, September 2017 and December 2017, BBX Capital's board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.0075 per share on BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. BBX Capital has indicated its intention to declare regular quarterly dividends on its Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. However, future dividends are subject to approval and declaration by BBX Capital's board of directors and, accordingly, BBX Capital may not make dividend payments in the future, whether in the amount anticipated, on a regular basis or as anticipated, or at all. The payment of dividends, if any, by BBX Capital will depend on many factors considered by its board of directors, including, without limitation, our financial condition and results of operations, liquidity requirements, market opportunities, and contractual constraints. Further, over time, the Company's cash needs may change significantly from its current needs, which could affect whether BBX Capital pays dividends and the amount of any dividends it may pay in the future. The terms of BBX Capital's indebtedness may also restrict it from paying cash dividends on its stock under certain circumstances. In addition, BBX Capital pays regular quarterly cash dividends of $187,500 with respect to its outstanding 5% Cumulative Preferred Stock. BBX Capital may not pay or set apart for payment any dividend or other distribution (other than a dividend or distribution payable solely in common stock) on its Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock until such time as all accrued and unpaid dividends on BBX Capital's 5% Cumulative Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are declared or paid and a sum is set apart sufficient for payment of such accrued and unpaid dividends.. <U+FEFF>. The provisional tax impacts resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are based on interpretations and assumptions the Company has made. Any changes in interpretations and assumptions or the issuance of additional regulatory guidance may have a material adverse impact on our tax rate in fiscal years 2018 and beyond.. <U+FEFF>. On December 22, 2017, U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Reform Act\"), was signed into law, significantly changing the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. These changes include, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate, subjecting certain future foreign subsidiary earnings, whether or not distributed, to U.S. tax under a Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income provision, imposing a new alternative \"Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax\" on U.S. corporations that limits deductions for certain amounts payable to foreign affiliates, imposing significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest payable to related and unrelated lenders, further limiting deductible executive compensation, and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries through the end of 2017. We continue to analyze how the Tax Reform Act may impact our results of operations.  The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") to address the application of GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. The Company has recognized the provisional tax impacts related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Reform Act. This continued analysis and resulting uncertainty, along with many of the changes effected pursuant to the Tax Reform Act, may have an adverse or volatile effect on our tax rate in fiscal years 2018 and beyond, thereby affecting our results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. There are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions used could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results.. <U+FEFF>. The consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports we file with the SEC, including this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets (including goodwill and other intangible assets), liabilities and related reserves, revenues, expenses and income. This includes estimates, judgments and assumptions for assessing the amortization/accretion of purchase accounting fair value differences and the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets pursuant to applicable accounting guidance. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are often not readily apparent from other sources. However, estimates, judgments and assumptions can be highly uncertain and are subject to change in the future, and our estimates, judgments and assumptions may prove to be incorrect and our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.. 47. If any estimates, judgments or assumptions change in the future, or our actual results differ from our estimates or assumptions, we may be required to record additional expenses or impairment charges, which would be recorded as a charge against our earnings and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.  Our goodwill was tested for impairment on December 31, 2017 (annual testing date) and the goodwill assigned to one of BBX Sweet Holdings reporting units was determined to be impaired.  The goodwill assigned to another BBX Sweet Holdings reporting unit was determined not to be impaired.  If BBX Sweet Holdings' reporting units do not meet expectations or if there is a downturn in the confectionery industry, we may recognize goodwill impairment charges in future periods.. <U+FEFF>. Unexpected events, such as natural disasters, severe weather and terrorist activities, may disrupt the Company's operations and increase our costs.. <U+FEFF>. The occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather or terrorist activities in countries or regions in which our assets, suppliers or our operating businesses are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.. <U+FEFF>. Natural disasters, acts or threats of war or terrorism, or other unexpected events could result in temporary or long-term disruption in the delivery or supply of necessary raw materials and component products from suppliers, which would disrupt production capabilities and likely increase our cost of doing business.. <U+FEFF>. Legal proceedings and the impact of any finding of liability or damages could adversely impact us and our financial condition and operating results.. <U+FEFF>. BBX Capital and its subsidiaries have in the past and may in the future be subject to legal proceedings, including numerous legal proceedings against Bluegreen with respect to its operations. The impact of any finding of liability or damages could adversely impact the Company's financial condition and operating results and the costs of defending pending or threatened legal proceedings could be significant.. <U+FEFF>. The loss of the services of key management and personnel could adversely affect the Company's business.. <U+FEFF>. The Company's ability to successfully implement its business strategy will depend on the ability to attract and retain experienced and knowledgeable management and other professional staff. If the Company is unable to retain and motivate its existing employees and efforts to retain and attract key management and other personnel are unsuccessful, the Company's results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted.. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. 48. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>"
