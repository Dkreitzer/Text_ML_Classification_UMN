[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our business is subject to numerous risks. You should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this Annual Report, as well as general economic and business risks, together with any other documents we file with the SEC. If any of the following events actually occur or risks actually materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.. Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs. We have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses over the next several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability.. We have a limited operating history. Since inception, we have incurred significant net losses. We incurred net losses of $68.5 million and $48.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $159.4 million. We have financed our operations since inception from sales of our convertible preferred stock and, beginning with our initial public offering in October 2015, from public offerings and a private placement of our common stock.  We currently have only one product, ESKATA, approved for commercialization and have never generated any revenue from product sales.. We have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to date to the development of our drug candidates, including preclinical studies and clinical trials. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbegin to commercialize ESKATA in the United States;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpursue marketing approval for ESKATA in the European Union for the treatment of SK;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontinue our ongoing clinical trials evaluating A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of common warts and pursue marketing approvals for A-101 45% Topical Solution and for any other drug candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinitiate and continue clinical trials of our other drug candidates, including ATI-501 and ATI-502 for the treatment of AA, vitiligo and AGA;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tseek to discover and develop additional drug candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablish a commercialization infrastructure and scale up external manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize ESKATA and any other drug candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tseek to in-license or acquire additional drug candidates for other dermatological conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadapt our regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed drugs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thire additional clinical, manufacturing and scientific personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadd operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our drug development and planned future expanded commercialization efforts; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur additional legal, accounting, investor relations and other administrative expenses in operating as a public company.. To become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and eventually commercializing drug candidates that generate significant revenue. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our drug candidates, obtaining marketing approval, and manufacturing, marketing and selling any drug candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval, as well as discovering and developing additional drug candidates. We are only in the early stages of most of these activities. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenue that is significant enough to achieve profitability.. 27. Table of Contents. For ESKATA and for any other drug candidates for which we are successful in obtaining marketing approval, our revenue will be dependent, in part, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain marketing approval, the accepted price for the product, the ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement, if any, and whether we own the commercial rights for that territory. If the number of our addressable patients is not as significant as we estimate, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than we expect, or the treatment population is narrowed by competition, physician choice or treatment guidelines, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of such drug products, even if approved.. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. If we are required by regulatory authorities to perform studies in addition to those expected, or if there are any delays in the initiation and completion of our clinical trials or the development of any of our drug candidates, our expenses could increase.. Even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our development efforts, obtain marketing approvals for our drugs, diversify our offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.. We will need substantial additional funding to meet our financial obligations and to pursue our business objectives. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to curtail our planned operations and the pursuit of our growth strategy.. Identifying potential drug candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years as we begin to commercialize ESKATA and conduct clinical trials of and seek marketing approval for our drug candidates.  In addition, ESKATA, and our other drug candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Though ESKATA has been approved by the FDA, we do not expect to generate substantial revenue from sales of ESKATA in the near term, if at all.  In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of common warts or any other drug candidates that we develop, we expect to incur additional significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing. We also expect an increase in our expenses associated with creating additional infrastructure to support our continuing operations as a public company.. 28. Table of Contents. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $208.9 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of the date of this Annual Report will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for a period greater than 12 months from the date of this report based on our current operating assumptions. These assumptions may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Changes may occur beyond our control that would cause us to consume our available capital before that time, including changes in and progress of our development activities, acquisitions of additional drug candidates, and changes in regulation. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe progress and success of commercializing ESKATA for the treatment of raised SKs in the United States;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe progress of obtaining marketing approval for ESKATA in the European Union;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe progress and results of the Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating A-101 45% Topical Solution as a potential treatment for common warts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our other drug candidates, including ATI-501 and ATI-502;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe extent to which we in-license or acquire other drug candidates and technologies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe number and development requirements of other drug candidates that we may pursue;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our drug candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including drug manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our drug candidates for which we receive marketing approval;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe revenue received from commercial sales of ESKATA and any of our other drug candidates for which we receive marketing approval;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to establish collaborations to commercialize ESKATA outside the United States; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims.. In connection with the commercial launch of ESKATA in the United States, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution.  We also expect that we will require additional capital to complete the clinical trials for and potentially commercialize A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of common warts.  Additional funds may not be available on a timely basis, on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, and such funds, if raised, may not be sufficient to enable us to continue to implement our long-term business strategy. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital, we could be forced to curtail our planned operations and the pursuit of our growth strategy.. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates.. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue, we may finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and license and collaboration agreements. We do not currently have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or drug candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our drug development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.. 29. Table of Contents. We have a limited operating history and no history of commercializing drugs, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.. We commenced operations in 2012, and our operations to date have been largely focused on raising capital, developing ESKATA for the treatment of raised SKs, including undertaking preclinical studies and conducting clinical trials, and acquiring new drug candidates and related intellectual property. ESKATA, A-101 45% Topical Solution and ATI-501 are our only product and drug candidates for which we have completed clinical trials. We have not yet demonstrated our ability to successfully manufacture a drug on a commercial scale, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or a history of successfully developing and commercializing drugs.. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known or unknown factors in achieving our business objectives. We will need to transition at some point from a company with a development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We may not be successful in such a transition.. Risks Related to the Development of Our Drug Candidates. If we are unable to successfully develop, receive marketing approval for and commercialize our drug candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be harmed.. We currently only have one product that is approved for commercial sale. We have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources in the development of ESKATA for the treatment of raised SKs, as well as the development of our other drug candidates and the identification of potential drug candidates. Our ability to generate substantial revenue from our drug candidates, which we do not expect will occur in the near term, will depend heavily on their successful development, marketing approval and eventual commercialization of these drug candidates. The success of ESKATA and any drug candidates that we develop, including A-101 45% Topical Solution, ATI-501 and ATI-502, will depend on several factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuccessful completion of preclinical studies and our clinical trials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuccessful development of our manufacturing processes for ESKATA and for any of our drug candidates that receive marketing approval;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treceipt of timely approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcommercial launch of ESKATA and, if approved, our other drug candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacceptance of ESKATA and our drug candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors, and willingness of patients to pay out of pocket for procedures using our drug candidates when third-party payor coverage and reimbursement is limited or unavailable;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour success in educating physicians and patients about the benefits, administration and use of ESKATA or, if approved, any other drug candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe prevalence and severity of adverse events experienced with our other drug candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability, perceived advantages, cost, safety and efficacy of alternative treatments for SK and common warts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtaining and maintaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our drug candidates and otherwise protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmaintaining compliance with regulatory requirements, including current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompeting effectively with other treatment procedures; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmaintaining a continued acceptable safety, tolerability and efficacy profile of our drugs following approval.. Whether marketing approval will be granted is unpredictable and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. Our drug candidates' success in clinical trials will not guarantee marketing approval. If, following submission, our NDA for any drug candidate is not accepted for substantive review, or even if it is accepted for substantive review, the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require that we conduct additional studies or clinical trials, provide additional data, take additional manufacturing steps, or require other conditions before they will reconsider or approve our application. If the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities require additional studies, clinical trials or data, we would incur increased costs and delays in the marketing. 30. Table of Contents. approval process, which may require us to expend more resources than we have available. In addition, the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not consider sufficient any additional required studies, clinical trials, data or information that we perform and complete or generate, or we may decide to abandon the program.. It is possible that our drug candidates currently in development will never obtain marketing approval, even if we expend substantial time and resources seeking such approval. If we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our drug candidates, which would harm our business.. Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our drug candidates.. The risk of failure for our drug candidates is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our drug candidates other than ESKATA will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive marketing approval. Before obtaining approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any drug candidate, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is inherently uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their drug candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their drugs.. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during or as a result of clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our drug candidates, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites or prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tclinical trials of our drug candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, including failure to demonstrate statistical significance, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon drug development programs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe number of patients required for clinical trials of our drug candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, or participants may drop out of these clinical trials or fail to return for post-treatment follow-up at a higher rate than we anticipate;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour drug candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators or institutional review boards to suspend or terminate the trials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical development for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of clinical trials of our drug candidates may be greater than we anticipate; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe supply or quality of our drug candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our drug candidates may be insufficient or inadequate.. We could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the institutional review boards of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by the data safety monitoring board for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may impose such a suspension or termination due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using. 31. Table of Contents. a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.  If we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of our drug candidates, the commercial prospects of our drug candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these drug candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our drug candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of our drug candidates. If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our drug candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our drug candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not favorable or if there are safety concerns, we may:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our drug candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnot obtain marketing approval at all;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtain marketing approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtain marketing approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thave the drug removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.. Our drug development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether any of our preclinical studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical study or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our drug candidates or allow our competitors to bring drugs to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our drug candidates.. If we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary marketing approvals could be delayed or prevented.. Successful and timely completion of clinical trials will require that we enroll a sufficient number of patients. Patient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population. Trials may be subject to delays as a result of patient enrollment taking longer than anticipated or patient withdrawal. We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our drug candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. We cannot predict how successful we will be at enrolling subjects in future clinical trials. Subject enrollment is affected by other factors including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe eligibility criteria for the trial in question;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe perceived risks and benefits of the drug candidate in the trial;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of drugs approved to treat the skin disease in the trial;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe patient referral practices of physicians;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us or them to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in these clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our drug candidates, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. Furthermore, we rely on and expect to continue to rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and we will have limited influence over their performance.. 32. Table of Contents. Our clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates, or serious adverse or unacceptable side effects may be identified during the development of our drug candidates, which could prevent or delay marketing approval and commercialization, increase our costs or necessitate the abandonment or limitation of the development of some of our drug candidates.. Before obtaining marketing approvals for the commercial sale of our drug candidates, we must demonstrate through lengthy, complex and expensive preclinical testing and clinical trials that our drug candidates are both safe and effective for use in each target indication, and failures can occur at any stage of testing. Clinical trials often fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the drug candidate studied for the target indication.. If our drug candidates are associated with side effects in clinical trials or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to more narrow uses in which the side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. The FDA or an institutional review board may also require that we suspend, discontinue, or limit our clinical trials based on safety information. Such findings could further result in regulatory authorities failing to provide marketing authorization for our drug candidates. Many drug candidates that initially showed promise in early stage testing have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the drug candidate.. Additionally, if we or others identify undesirable side effects caused by our drugs, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory authorities may withdraw approval to market such product;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the labels;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour reputation and physician or patient acceptance of our products may suffer.. Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular drug candidate and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.. Changes in methods of drug candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in additional costs or delay.. As drug candidates are developed through preclinical studies to late-stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods and formulation, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives, and may also require additional testing, FDA notification or FDA approval.  Any of these changes could cause our drug candidates to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials conducted with the altered materials.  This could delay completion of clinical trials, require the conduct of bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our drug candidates and jeopardize our ability to commence sales and generate revenue.. We may not be successful in our efforts to increase our pipeline of drug candidates, including by in-licensing or acquiring additional drug candidates for other dermatological conditions.. A key element of our strategy is to build and expand our pipeline of drug candidates. In addition, we intend to in-license or acquire additional drug candidates for other dermatological conditions to build a fully integrated dermatology company. We may not be able to identify or develop drug candidates that are safe, tolerable and effective. Even if we are successful in continuing to build our pipeline, the potential drug candidates that we identify, in-license or acquire may not be suitable for clinical development, including as a result of being shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be drugs that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance.. 33. Table of Contents. We may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular drug candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on drug candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.. Because we have limited financial and management resources, we focus on development programs and drug candidates that we identify for specific indications. As such, we are currently primarily focused on the commercialization of ESKATA and the development of A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of common warts. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other drug candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial drugs or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future development programs and drug candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable drugs. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular drug candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that drug candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such drug candidate.. Risks Related to the Commercialization of Our Drug Candidates. ESKATA, and any of our drug candidates that receive marketing approval, may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.. ESKATA, and any of our drug candidates that receive marketing approval, may fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. If ESKATA and our drug candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant revenue and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of ESKATA and, if approved, any drug candidate, will depend on a number of factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe efficacy, safety and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to offer our products for sale at competitive prices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe willingness of the target patient population to try new treatments and of physicians to prescribe these treatments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to hire and retain a sales force in the United States;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe strength of marketing and distribution support;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe willingness of patients to pay out of pocket for procedures using ESKATA for the treatment of raised SKs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe prevalence and severity of any side effects; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications.. If we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for ESKATA, or a drug candidate that may receive marketing approval, we may not be successful in commercializing ESKATA or those drug candidates if and when they are approved.. To achieve commercial success for ESKATA and any other drug candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval, we will need to build a focused sales and marketing infrastructure to market or co-promote ESKATA and, if approved, some of our drug candidates in the United States.  We have begun this process, but there are risks involved with establishing our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any drug launch. If the commercial launch of a drug candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.  Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our drugs on our own include:. 34. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future drugs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe lack of complementary drugs to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.. If we are unable to establish our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and enter into arrangements with third parties to perform these services, our revenue and our profitability, if any, are likely to be lower than if we were to sell, market and distribute any drugs that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell, market and distribute our drug candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our drugs effectively. If we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our drug candidates.. We face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing drugs before or more successfully than we do.. The development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current drug candidates, and will face competition with respect to any drug candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.. With respect to ESKATA for the treatment of raised SKs, we are aware of two biopharmaceutical companies developing drug candidates which target SK, and another company that currently markets a line of cosmetic products targeting skin conditions, including SK. We are also aware of early research being conducted with Akt inhibitors as a potential treatment for SK.. With respect to A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of common warts, we are aware of four companies developing drug candidates for the treatment of common warts. In addition, other drugs have been used off-label as treatments for common warts. We could also encounter competition from over-the-counter treatments for common warts.. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than ESKATA or any other drug that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our drug, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.. With respect to ATI-501 and ATI-502 for the treatment of AA, we anticipate competing with sensitizing agents such as diphencyprone, and topical, intralesional and systemic corticosteroids, which have been found to occasionally reduce symptoms of AA. Other treatments utilized for patchy AA include anthralin and minoxidil solution. We may also compete with companies developing chemical agents to be used in topical immunotherapies, as well as companies developing biologics, immunosuppressive agents, laser therapy, phototherapy, other JAK inhibitors and prostaglandin analogues to treat AA.. Many of the companies against which we are competing, or against which we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical development, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs.. 35. Table of Contents. We expect third-party payors generally will not cover the use of ESKATA for the treatment of raised SKs and, accordingly, our success will be dependent upon the willingness of patients to pay out of pocket for ESKATA.. We do not expect third-party payors to cover and reimburse providers who use ESKATA on patients for the treatment of raised SKs. Payors generally do not reimburse the provider for the product used to remove non-malignant lesions, including SK. In addition, they do not generally reimburse providers for the procedure removing such lesions, since the procedure is considered to be cosmetic in nature, unless there is a medical need to remove the lesion such as confirming a diagnosis with a biopsy or treating SK that are causing the patient physical discomfort. We anticipate that in some cases, ESKATA will be used to remove SK lesions that are inflamed and causing the patient discomfort. Any reduction in reimbursement for the procedure to remove inflamed SK may result in a higher percentage of patients needing to pay out of pocket for ESKATA. Accordingly, the commercial success of ESKATA depends on the extent to which patients will be willing to pay out of pocket for the in-office procedure.. The success of our drug candidates for the treatment of common warts will depend significantly on continued coverage and adequate reimbursement or the willingness of patients to pay for these procedures.. In the case of A-101 45% Topical Solution, if approved, for the treatment of common warts, we believe our success depends on continued coverage and adequate reimbursement for in-office wart treatment procedures or, in the absence of coverage and adequate reimbursement, on the extent to which patients will be willing to pay out of pocket for the in-office procedures that include our drug candidates.. Third-party payors determine which medical procedures they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Even if a third-party payor covers a particular procedure, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate. Patients who are treated in-office for a medical condition generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with the procedure and may be unwilling to undergo such procedures for the removal of warts in the absence of such coverage and reimbursement. Physicians may be unlikely to offer procedures for the treatment of warts if they are not covered by insurance and may be unlikely to purchase and use our product for warts unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate.. Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor's determination that a procedure is neither cosmetic, experimental, nor investigational; safe, effective, and medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; cost-effective; supported by peer-reviewed medical journals; and included in clinical practice guidelines.. Further, from time to time, typically on an annual basis, payment rates are updated and revised by third-party payors. To the extent that the procedures using our drug candidates, are covered, the cost of our products are generally recovered by the healthcare provider as part of the payment for performing a procedure and not separately reimbursed. Accordingly, these updates could impact the demand for our drug candidates. An example of payment updates is the Medicare program updates to physician payments, which is done on an annual basis. In the past, when the application of the formula resulted in lower payment, Congress has passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions.  MACRA ended the use of the statutory formula and provided for a 0.5% annual increase in payment rates under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule through 2019, but no annual update from 2020 through 2025.  MACRA also introduced a merit based incentive bonus program for Medicare physicians beginning in 2019.  At this time, it is unclear how the introduction of the merit based incentive program will impact overall physician reimbursement under the Medicare program. Any resulting decrease in payment under the merit based reimbursement system may adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. In addition, the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule has been adapted by some private payors into their plan-specific physician payment schedule. We cannot predict how pending and future healthcare legislation will impact our business, and any changes in coverage and reimbursement that further restricts coverage of our drug candidates or lowers reimbursement for procedures using our products could harm our business.. Foreign governments also have their own healthcare reimbursement systems, which vary significantly by country and region, and we cannot be sure that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be made available with respect to the treatments in which our drugs are used under any foreign reimbursement system.. There can be no assurance that our drug candidates for the treatment of common warts, if they are approved for sale in the United States or in other countries, will be considered medically reasonable and necessary, that they will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that coverage or an adequate level of reimbursement will be available, or. 36. Table of Contents. that reimbursement policies and practices in the United States and in foreign countries where our products are sold will not adversely affect our ability to sell our drugs candidates profitably if they are approved for sale.. Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any drugs that we may develop.. We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our drug candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if and when we begin commercially selling ESKATA. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our drug candidates or drugs caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdecreased demand for any drug candidates or drugs that we may develop;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twithdrawal of clinical trial participants;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsubstantial monetary awards paid to trial participants or patients;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of revenue;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability to commercialize any drugs that we may develop.. We currently hold $10 million in product liability insurance coverage in the aggregate, with a per incident limit of $10 million, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We may need to increase our insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials or if we commence commercialization of our drug candidates. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.. Our business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks or a deficiency in our cyber-security.. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our marketing approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur material legal claims and liability, damage to our reputation, and the further development or commercialization of our drug candidates could be delayed.. 37. Table of Contents. Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties. We will rely on third parties to conduct our future clinical trials for drug candidates, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.. We engage CROs to conduct clinical trials of our drug candidates. We expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct those clinical trials. If any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to timely enter into arrangements with alternative third parties or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, any third parties conducting our clinical trials will not be our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical programs. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain marketing approval for or successfully commercialize our drug candidates. Consequently, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our drug candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase substantially and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed significantly.. Switching or adding CROs involves substantial cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we intend to carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.. We rely on these parties for execution of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and generally do not control their activities. Our reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the marketing approval process.. We also rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for the commercialization of ESKATA and for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our drug candidates or commercialization of our drugs, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential revenue.. 38. Table of Contents. We contract with third parties for the manufacture of commercial quantities of ESKATA and supply of our drug candidates for preclinical and clinical testing. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of ESKATA and our drug candidates or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.. We do not have any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of commercial quantities of ESKATA and supply of our drug candidates for preclinical and clinical testing.  For example, we have entered into an exclusive, ten-year, automatically renewable supply agreement with PeroxyChem, a manufacturer of hydrogen peroxide, to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient that can be used in ESKATA for the treatment of raised SKs. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our drug candidates at an acceptable cost and/or quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our ability to timely conduct our clinical trials or our other development or commercialization efforts.. The facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our drug candidates must be approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit our NDA or comparable marketing application to the FDA or other regulatory authority. We do not have control over a supplier's or manufacturer's compliance with laws, regulations and applicable cGMP standards and other laws and regulations, such as those related to environmental health and safety matters. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to secure and maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our drug candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our drug candidates.. We may be unable to establish any agreements with future third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe possible increase in costs by PeroxyChem for the active pharmaceutical ingredient in ESKATA;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe possible increase in costs by James Alexander for the finished dosage form of ESKATA; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.. Third-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products.. Our products and drug candidates that we may develop may compete with other products and drug candidates for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us. Any performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or marketing approval. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply or a second source for the components of ESKATA.. If our current contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace such manufacturers. We may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacement.. We expect to continue to depend on third-party contract manufacturers for the foreseeable future. Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our products and drug candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any drugs that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.. 39. Table of Contents. We may seek collaborations with third parties for the development or commercialization of our drug candidates. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these drug candidates.. We may seek third-party collaborators for the development and commercialization of our drug candidates, including for the commercialization of any of our drug candidates that are approved for marketing outside the United States. Our likely collaborators for any collaboration arrangements include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. If we do enter into any such arrangements with any third parties, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our drug candidates. Our ability to generate revenue from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators' abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.. Collaborations involving our drug candidates would pose the following risks to us:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcollaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of any drug candidates that achieve marketing approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators' strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a drug candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a drug candidate for clinical testing;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or drug candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdrug candidates discovered in collaboration with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own products or drug candidates, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our drug candidates that achieve marketing approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such drug candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of drug candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to drug candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our or their intellectual property rights or may use our or their proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate such intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcollaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcollaborations may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable drug candidates.. Collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of drug candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If a present or future collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our drug development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.. 40. Table of Contents. If we are not able to establish collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.. Our drug development programs and the potential commercialization of our drug candidates will require substantial additional capital. For some of our drug candidates, we may decide to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those drug candidates.. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator's resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator's evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject drug candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such drug candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative drug candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our drug candidate. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators.. We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of such drug candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our drug candidates or bring them to market and generate revenue.. Our sublease could terminate if the master lease is terminated for any reason, thus terminating our rights to our corporate headquarters.. We sublease space for our corporate headquarters.  While the term of the sublease extends until October 2023, if for any reason the master lease is terminated or expires prior to October 2023, our sublease will also automatically terminate.  In such an event, we would need to obtain a new direct lease with the master landlord or negotiate and enter into a new lease for office space at a different location, which we may not be able to do on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property. If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our drug candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and drugs similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and drug candidates may be impaired.. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our drug candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our drug candidates.. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, however, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. We may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the rights to patents licensed to third parties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.. 41. Table of Contents. The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States or vice versa. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than U.S. law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect our technology or drugs, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and drugs. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.. Recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The United States Patent Office recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.. Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or drugs and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize drugs without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications that we own, or license is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future drug candidates.. Even if our patent applications that we own or license issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or drugs in a non-infringing manner.  For example, the patents and patent applications that we exclusively licensed from Columbia University that are primarily directed to methods of treating hair loss disorders with JAK inhibitors may not issue or may issue with claims directed to the use of specific JAK inhibitors, which may not be relevant to the JAK inhibitors we intend to commercialize or the JAK inhibitors that our competitors may commercialize.. 42. Table of Contents. In addition, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and drugs, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and drugs.  Our issued U.S. patents, with claims directed to treatment of SK and acrochordons with high-concentration hydrogen peroxide of at least 23%, including ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution, are scheduled to expire in 2022, and our issued U.S. formulation patent with claims directed to high-concentration hydrogen peroxide formulations, including ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution, and methods of use is scheduled to expire in 2035.  Certain issued U.S. patents relating to our JAK inhibitors, ATI-501 and ATI-502, are scheduled to expire in 2023 and additional U.S. patents, with claims specifically directed to such JAK inhibitors, are scheduled to expire in 2030.  The issued U.S. and Japanese patents that we exclusively licensed from Columbia University with claims directed to the use of third party JAK inhibitors for the treatment of hair loss disorders, including AA and AGA, and inducing hair growth, expire in 2031.  We currently do not have any patents issued directed to our \"soft\" JAK inhibitors, but any claims that may issue would expire in 2038.  Our issued U.S. patent covering our lead inhibitors of the MK-2 signaling pathway inhibitor, expires in 2034 and other issued patents covering different MK-2 signaling pathway inhibitors expire in 2031 and 2032. Our issued patents covering our novel inhibitors of ITK expire between 2035 and 2038.  Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new drug candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing drugs similar or identical to ours.. We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.  Further, our issued patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court.. Competitors may infringe our issued patents or other intellectual property. Our pending applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents or that our patents are invalid or unenforceable.  Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, non-enablement or insufficient written description. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before the USPTO, in post-grant proceedings such as ex parte reexaminations, inter partes review, or post-grant review, or oppositions or similar administrative proceedings outside the United States, in parallel with litigation or, even outside the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our drug candidates. Such a loss of patent protection would harm our business.. In such a proceeding, a court or administrative board may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent's claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology. An adverse result in any such proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. We may find it impractical or undesirable to enforce our intellectual property against some third parties. For instance, we are aware of third parties that have marketed high-concentration hydrogen peroxide solutions over the internet for the treatment of SK and warts. These parties do not appear to have regulatory authority, and we have not authorized them in any way to market these products. However, to date we have refrained from seeking to enforce our intellectual property rights against these third parties due to the transient nature of their activities.. Interference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms.. 43. Table of Contents. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.. With respect to ATI-501 and ATI-502, if we do not elect to exercise our first right to do so, Rigel may enforce the licensed patents relating to ATI-501 and ATI-502 against any infringing third party in the field of dermatology. In addition, Rigel has the first right, but not the obligation, to enforce the licensed patents relating to ATI-501 and ATI-502 against any infringing party outside of the field of dermatology.  With respect to the licensed patents from Columbia University, Columbia University has the first right to initiate, control and defend any proceedings related to the validity, enforceability or infringement of the licensed patent rights and in doing so, has no obligation to assert more than one licensed patent in one jurisdiction against a third party.  With respect to the licensed patents from Columbia University, if Columbia University does not elect to exercise its first right to do so, we may enforce the licensed patent rights relating to an infringement of the licensed patent rights against any infringing third party.. If we breach our license agreement with Rigel, it could compromise our development and commercialization efforts for our JAK inhibitors ATI-501 and ATI-502.. In August 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Rigel, which grants us the rights to certain patent rights and other intellectual property owned by them relating to the JAK inhibitors ATI-501 and ATI-502 in the field of dermatology. If we materially breach or fail to perform any provision under this license agreement, including failure to make payments to Rigel when due for royalties and failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a JAK inhibitor, Rigel has the right to terminate our license, and upon the effective date of such termination, our right to practice the licensed Rigel's patent rights and other intellectual property would end. Any uncured, material breach under the license agreement could result in our loss of rights to practice the patent rights and other intellectual property licensed to us under the license agreement with Rigel.. If we breach our agreement with the selling stockholders of Vixen, it could compromise our development and commercialization efforts for our JAK inhibitors.. In March 2016, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with the stockholders of Vixen, pursuant to which we purchased all of the stock of Vixen and assumed its license agreement with Columbia University.  If we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a JAK inhibitor for AA and a JAK inhibitor for AGA, the license agreement with Columbia University will be transferred to the selling stockholders of Vixen following any adverse resolution of any dispute relating thereto.  Upon the effective date of such transfer, our right to practice the licensed Columbia University patent rights and know-how would end.. If we breach our agreement with Columbia University, it could compromise our development and commercialization efforts for our JAK inhibitors.. In March 2016, as part of the Vixen acquisition, we assumed a license agreement with Columbia University, which grants us the right under certain patent rights and know-how owned by Columbia University relating to the use of JAK inhibitors to treat hair-loss disorders. If we materially breach or fail to perform any provision under this license agreement, including failure to make payments to Columbia University when due for royalties and failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a licensed product, Columbia University has the right to terminate our license, and upon the effective date of such termination, our right to practice the licensed Columbia University patent rights and know-how would end. Any uncured, material breach under the license agreement could result in our loss of rights to practice the patent rights and know-how licensed to us under the license agreement, and, to the extent such patent rights and know-how relate to our JAK inhibitors, it could compromise our development and commercialization efforts for ATI-501 or ATI-502.. 44. Table of Contents. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on our drug candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. For example, the use of ESKATA for the treatment of raised SKs is currently covered by patents in the United States, Australia, India and New Zealand, but not in the European Union or other countries. The use of A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of warts is currently covered by issued patents in the United States, Australia, India and New Zealand, but not in the European Union or other countries.  A U.S. patent is issued, and patent applications are pending in the United States, the European Union and other foreign countries directed to high-concentration hydrogen peroxide formulations, including ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution and methods of use.  Our JAK inhibitors, ATI-501 and ATI-502, are currently covered in patents and applications in the United States, the European Union, and other major foreign markets.  Additionally, U.S. and Japanese patents have issued in the patent portfolio licensed from Columbia University, which are directed to the use of certain third party JAK inhibitors for the treatment of hair loss disorders and applications are pending in the United States, the European Union, Japan and South Korea.  In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States.  Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our invention in such countries. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement rights are not as strong as those in the United States.  These products may compete with our drug candidates and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.. Many countries, including European Union countries, India, Japan and China, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled under specified circumstances to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.. We may need to license intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.. A third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development of our drug candidates. For example, we exclusively licensed intellectual property from Rigel in the field of dermatology related to our JAK inhibitors,  ATI-501 and ATI-502.  We also exclusively licensed intellectual property from Columbia University related to the use of JAK inhibitors for the treatment of hair loss disorders.  It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our drug candidates, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially.. 45. Table of Contents. Our third-party licensors may develop JAK inhibitors, including those related to our drug candidates, outside of the field of dermatology.. We exclusively licensed intellectual property from Rigel in order to develop, use, manufacture, sell and commercialize ATI-501 and ATI-502 in the field of dermatology. Rigel has retained the rights under such intellectual property to develop, use, manufacture, sell and commercialize ATI-501 and ATI-502 outside of the field of dermatology. If Rigel were to commercialize such JAK inhibitors outside the field of dermatology, such a product could possibly be used off-label for a dermatology indication, which could negatively impact sales of our drug candidates, if approved. Rigel also retained the intellectual property rights to develop, use, manufacture, sell and commercialize other structurally similar JAK inhibitors. If Rigel commercializes a structurally similar JAK inhibitor, such a product could directly compete with our drug candidates, if approved.. Third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.. Our commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our drug candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our drugs and technology, including interference or derivation proceedings before the USPTO. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing our drug candidates. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future.. If we are found to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our drugs and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or drug. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys' fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our drug candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys' fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing product or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.. We may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that we, our employees or our licensors have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.. Many of our employees and our licensor's employees were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. Although we and our licensor try to ensure that our employees and our licensors' employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we or our licensors may be subject to claims that these employees, our licensors or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee's former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.. In addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.. 46. Table of Contents. If we or our licensors fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we and our licensors are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.. Intellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources. They are, therefore, likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation longer than we could. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could harm our business. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could compromise our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our internal research programs, or in-license needed technology or other drug candidates. There could also be public announcements of the results of the hearing, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive those results to be negative, it could cause the price of shares of our common stock to decline.  Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace, including compromising our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter into development collaborations that would help us commercialize our drug candidates.. If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.. In addition to seeking patents for our drug candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.. The validity, scope and enforceability of any of our patents that cover ESKATA, A-101 45% Topical Solution or any of our other drug candidates can be challenged by competitors.. The likelihood that a third party will challenge our patents covering ESKATA is increased now that it has received marketing approval from the FDA.  The challenge may come in the form of a patent office proceeding, such as an inter partes review, challenging the validity of the patents or a district court proceeding, such as a paragraph IV litigation arising out of the filing of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA.. 47. Table of Contents. If a third party files an ANDA for a generic drug containing ESKATA, and relies in whole or in part on studies conducted by or for us, the third party will be required to certify to the FDA that either: (1) there is no patent information listed in the FDA's Orange Book with respect to our NDA for the applicable approved drug candidate; (2) the patents listed in the Orange Book have expired; (3) the listed patents have not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patents are invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the third party's generic drug. A certification that the new drug will not infringe the Orange Book-listed patents for the applicable approved drug candidate, or that such patents are invalid, is called a paragraph IV certification. If the third party submits a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, a notice of the paragraph IV certification must also be sent to us once the third party's ANDA is accepted for filing by the FDA. We may then initiate a lawsuit to defend the patents identified in the notice. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notice automatically prevents the FDA from approving the third party's ANDA until the earliest of 30 months or the date on which the patent expires, the lawsuit is settled, or the court reaches a decision in the infringement lawsuit in favor of the third party. If we do not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required 45-day period, the third party's ANDA will not be subject to the 30-month stay of FDA approval. Litigation or other proceedings to enforce or defend intellectual property rights are often very complex in nature, may be very expensive and time-consuming, may divert our management's attention from our core business, and may result in unfavorable results that could limit our ability to prevent third parties from competing with ESKATA.. If A-101 45% Topical Solution, our JAK inhibitors, or any of our other drug candidates advance through development or is approved by the FDA, one or more third parties may challenge the current patents, or patents that may issue in the future, within our portfolio covering these drug candidates. Any such challenge could result in the invalidation of, or render unenforceable, some or all of the relevant patent claims or a finding of non-infringement.. If we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act by extending the patent term and obtaining data exclusivity for our drug candidates, our business may be materially harmed.. Our commercial success will largely depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology, drug candidates and our target indications.  Our issued U.S. patent with claims directed to treatment of SK with ESKATA is scheduled to expire in 2022 and our issued U.S. formulation patent with claims directed to high-concentration hydrogen peroxide formulations, including ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution, and methods of use is scheduled to expire in 2035.  Certain issued U.S. patents relating to our JAK inhibitors, ATI-501 and ATI-502, are scheduled to expire in 2023 and additional U.S. patents, with claims specifically directed to such JAK inhibitors, are scheduled to expire in 2030.  The issued U.S. and Japanese patents licensed from Columbia University relating to the use of certain third party JAK inhibitor for the treatment of hair loss disorders, including AA and AGA, and inducing hair growth, expire in 2031.  Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new drug candidates, patents protecting our drug candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates begin to be commercialized. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms in the United States and, if available, in other countries where we are prosecuting patents.. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our drug candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, for a drug candidate. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent extension term of up to five years beyond the normal expiration of the patent as compensation for patent term lost during development and the FDA regulatory review process, which is limited to the approved indication (or any additional indications approved during the period of extension). This extension is limited to only one patent per regulatory review period that covers the approved product. However, the applicable authorities, including the FDA and the USPTO in the United States, and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. We may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. We believe that ESKATA is eligible for patent term extension and we have filed an application with the USPTO requesting patent term extension for one patent that covers ESKATA; however, the USPTO and/or the FDA may disagree with our interpretation.. 48. Table of Contents. If we are unable to extend the expiration date of our existing patents or obtain new patents with longer expiry dates, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data to obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.  For example, even if we obtain new chemical entity, or NCE, exclusivity for ESKATA, we could be subject to generic competition as early as the end of the applicable exclusivity period, if our patent portfolio does not have sufficient term or scope to prevent such generic competition.. Any trademarks we have obtained or may obtain may be infringed or successfully challenged, resulting in harm to our business.. We expect to rely on trademarks as one means to distinguish any of our drug candidates that are approved for marketing from the products of our competitors. Once we select new trademarks and apply to register them, our trademark applications may not be approved. Third parties may oppose or attempt to cancel our trademark applications or trademarks, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our drugs, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Our competitors may infringe our trademarks and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.. Outside of the United States we cannot be certain that any country's patent or trademark office will not implement new rules that could seriously affect how we draft, file, prosecute and maintain patents, trademarks and patent and trademark applications.. We cannot be certain that the patent or trademark offices of countries outside the United States will not implement new rules that increase costs for drafting, filing, prosecuting and maintaining patents, trademarks and patent and trademark applications or that any such new rules will not restrict our ability to file for patent protection. For example, we may elect not to seek patent protection in some jurisdictions or for some drug candidates in order to save costs. We may be forced to abandon or return the rights to specific patents due to a lack of financial resources.. Intellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.. The degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tothers may be able to make formulations or compositions that are the same as or similar to ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tothers may be able to make a JAK inhibitor that is similar to the JAK inhibitors we intend to commercialize that is not covered by the patents that we exclusively licensed and have the right to enforce;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe, our licensor or any collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents or pending patent applications that we own;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe, our licensor might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tit is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tissued patents that we own may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour competitors might conduct research and development activities in the United States and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights, and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.. 49. Table of Contents. Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Drug Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters. If we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our drug candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.. Our drug candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by the European Commission and EU Member State Competent Authorities and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a drug candidate will prevent us from commercializing the drug candidate. Other than the approval of ESKATA in the United States, we have not received approval to market any of our drug candidates from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction. We have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the drug candidate's safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the drug manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Our drug candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. If any of our drug candidates receive marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the approved use of our drug in this way, which could limit sales of the drug.. The process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive and may take many years if additional clinical trials are required, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the drug candidates involved. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted drug application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a drug candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved drug not commercially viable.. If we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our drug candidates, the commercial prospects for our drug candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.. Failure to obtain marketing approval in international jurisdictions would prevent our drug candidates from being marketed abroad.. In order to market and sell our drugs in the European Union and any other jurisdictions, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the drug be approved for reimbursement before the drug can be approved for sale in that country. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. However, failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may impact our ability to obtain approval elsewhere. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our drugs in any market.. 50. Table of Contents. A variety of risks associated with marketing our drug candidates internationally could harm our business.. We are seeking marketing approval for ESKATA outside of the United States, and we may also seek marketing approval for our drug candidates currently in development and, accordingly, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if we obtain the necessary approvals, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiffering regulatory requirements in foreign countries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe potential for so-called parallel importing, which is what happens when a local seller, faced with high or higher local prices, opts to import goods from a foreign market (with low or lower prices) rather than buying them locally;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforeign reimbursement, pricing and insurance regimes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 or comparable foreign regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchallenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlogistical challenges resulting from distributing ESKATA or our drug candidates to foreign countries; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.. These and other risks associated with our international operations may compromise our ability to achieve or maintain profitability.. ESKATA, or any drug candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or recall or withdrawal from the market, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our drug candidates, when and if any of them are approved.. ESKATA, or any drug candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such drug candidate, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a drug candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the drug candidate may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including the requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. If any of our drug candidates receives marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the approved use of our drug, which could limit sales of the drug.. The FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the drug. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label use and if we do not market our drugs for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.. 51. Table of Contents. In addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our drugs, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may have negative consequences, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions on such drugs, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions on the labeling or marketing of a drug;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions on drug distribution or use;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twarning letters;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trecall or withdrawal of the drugs from the market;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tclinical holds;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trefusal to permit the import or export of our drugs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdrug seizure; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.. Non-compliance with the European Union's requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of drugs for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with the European Union's requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions.. Our current and future relationships with third-party payors, health care professionals and customers in the United States and elsewhere may be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, physician payment transparency, health information privacy and security and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to significant penalties.. Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with third-party payors, health care professionals and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal civil False Claims Act, that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we sell, market and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by the federal government and by the U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation.  Further, several courts have interpreted the statute's intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated.  The intent standard was further amended by the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.  Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;. 52. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfederal civil and criminal false claims laws, including, without limitation, the federal civil False Claims Act (that can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions), and the civil monetary penalties law, which impose criminal and civil penalties, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tHIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tHIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose obligations on covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal Open Payments program, created under Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, which requires specified manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other \"transfers of value\" made to physicians, which is defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors, and teaching hospitals and applicable manufacturers to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members by the 90th day of each calendar year. All such reported information is publicly available; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state, local and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and/or that require registration of certain employees engaged in marketing activities in the location; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices, including our relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers, some of whom may recommend, purchase and/or prescribe our drug candidates, may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. By way of example, some of our consulting arrangements with physicians may not meet all of the criteria of the personal services safe harbor under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Accordingly, they may not qualify for safe harbor protection from government prosecution. A business arrangement that does not substantially comply with a safe harbor, however, is not necessarily illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute, but may be subject to additional scrutiny by the government.. 53. Table of Contents. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, it may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from participation in government healthcare programs, which could also materially affect our business.. Recently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our drug candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.. In the United States, and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our drug candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.  The Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law in March 2010, is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to our potential drug candidates are the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tan annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tan increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, which include, among other things, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for non-compliance;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (and 70% commencing January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\textension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe new requirements under the federal Open Payments program and its implementing regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.. 54. Table of Contents. Since its enactment there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to, as well efforts by the Trump Administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. As a result, there have been delays in the implementation of, and action taken to repeal or replace, certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act.  For example, since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been signed into law.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \"individual mandate\".  Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain Affordable Care Act-mandated fees, including the so-called \"Cadillac\" tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \"donut hole\".  Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or replace elements of the Affordable Care Act. We continue to evaluate the impact of the Affordable Care Act and efforts to repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act on our business.. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year that became effective on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken.  The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was signed into law in January 2013, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Any similar new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for ESKATA and, if approved, our drug candidates, and, accordingly, our financial operations.. We expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved drug. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our drugs.. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for drugs.  In addition, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump Administration's budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump Administration have both stated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing  We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our drug candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA's approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent drug labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.. 55. Table of Contents. If ESKATA is not granted NCE exclusivity from the FDA, our period of marketing exclusivity for ESKATA will be shorter than previously anticipated, and our business could be harmed.. Under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, as amended by the Hatch-Waxman Act, a drug that is granted regulatory approval may be eligible for five years of marketing exclusivity in the United States following regulatory approval if that drug is classified as an NCE.  A drug can be classified as an NCE if the FDA has not previously approved any other drug containing the same active moiety.. The FDA published a determination on the marketing exclusivity of ESKATA in a cumulative supplement to its Orange Book and determined that ESKATA is eligible for a three-year period of exclusivity for a new product, which would continue until December 14, 2020, rather than the five-year exclusivity for an NCE.  While we believe we are entitled to an NCE determination for ESKATA, to date the FDA has not agreed with our position.  We are in the process of reviewing our options as it relates to the FDA's determination.  Even if we appeal the FDA's decision, there can be no assurance that ESKATA will be granted NCE exclusivity, or that the FDA will make a determination on any such appeal of their exclusivity decision in a timely manner.. NCE marketing exclusivity, if granted, would preclude approval during the five-year exclusivity period of certain 505(b)(2) applications or abbreviated new drug applications that rely upon the FDA's findings of safety and efficacy for ESKATA.  However, such an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. In this case, we may be afforded the benefit of a 30-month stay against the launch of such a competitive product that would extend from the end of the five-year exclusivity period, and may also be afforded other extensions under applicable regulations, including a judicial extension if applicable requirements are met. If we are not able to gain or exploit the period of marketing exclusivity, we may face significant competitive threats from other manufacturers, including the manufacturers of generic alternatives. Further, even if ESKATA is considered to be an NCE and we are able to gain five-year marketing exclusivity, another company could challenge that decision to seek to overturn the FDA's determination.. ESKATA has been granted three years of new product exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. A three-year period of exclusivity is granted under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments for a drug product that contains an active moiety that has been previously approved when the application contains reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted by the sponsor that were essential to approval of the application.  Our clinical trials of ESKATA were new clinical investigations that were essential to the approval of our NDA.  We are entitled to at least three-year exclusivity even if the FDA determines that the hydrogen peroxide moiety was previously approved because our clinical investigations were essential for the approval of our new drug product, ESKATA.. Such three-year exclusivity protection precludes the FDA from approving a marketing application for 505(b)(2) NDA or ANDA for the same conditions of approval as ESKATA for a period of three years from the date of ESKATA's FDA approval, i.e., through December 14, 2020 although the FDA may accept and commence review of such applications during the exclusivity period. This three-year form of exclusivity may also not prevent the FDA from approving an NDA that relies only on its own data to support the change or innovation.  Any loss of exclusive marketing rights to ESKATA through introduction of generic or competing products would harm our financial position.. Governments outside the United States tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenue, if any.. In some countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a drug. To obtain coverage and reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our drug candidate to other available procedures. If reimbursement of our drugs is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be harmed, possibly materially.. 56. Table of Contents. If we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.. We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.. Although we maintain workers' compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our development or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.. The inherent dangers in production and transportation of hydrogen peroxide could cause disruptions and could expose us to potentially significant losses, costs or liabilities.. Our operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in the use and transport of hydrogen peroxide, the active ingredient of ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution. Hydrogen peroxide can decompose in the presence of organic materials and is categorized as an oxidizer and is corrosive. Hydrogen peroxide should be stored in cool, dry, well-ventilated areas and away from any flammable or combustible substances. The hazards and risks associated with producing and transporting hydrogen peroxide include fires, explosions, third-party interference (including terrorism) and mechanical failure of equipment at our facilities or those of our supplier of hydrogen peroxide. The occurrence of any of these events could result in production and distribution difficulties and disruptions, personal injury or wrongful death claims and other damage to properties.. We are subject to governmental economic sanctions and export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.. As a U.S. company, we are subject to U.S. import and export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations, and we are required to import and export our product and drug candidates, technology and services in compliance with those laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and economic embargo and trade sanction programs administered by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control.. U.S. economic sanctions and export control laws and regulations prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. While we are currently taking precautions to prevent doing any business, directly or indirectly, with countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions and to ensure that our drug candidates, are not exported or used by countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions, such measures may be circumvented.. Furthermore, if we export our drug candidates, the exports may require authorizations, including a license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorization. Complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Failure to comply with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may expose us to government investigations and penalties.. 57. Table of Contents. If we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or import or export control laws, it could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, including possible incarceration for those individuals responsible for the violations, the loss of export or import privileges and reputational harm.. We are subject to anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws with respect to our operations and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal and/or civil liability and harm our business.. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C.  201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. As we commercialize our drug candidates and eventually commence international sales and business, we may engage with collaborators and third-party intermediaries to sell our products abroad and to obtain necessary permits, licenses and other regulatory approvals. We or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities.. Noncompliance with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage and other collateral consequences. Responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management's attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.. Risks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Our Growth. Our future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.. We are highly dependent on the management, development, clinical, financial, legal and business development expertise of Dr. Neal Walker, our Chief Executive Officer, Christopher Powala, our Chief Regulatory and Development Officer, Dr. Stuart Shanler, our Chief Scientific Officer, Frank Ruffo, our Chief Financial Officer, Brett Fair, our Chief Commercial Officer, and Kamil Ali-Jackson, our Chief Legal Officer, as well as the other members of our scientific and clinical teams. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers, each of them may currently terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \"key person\" insurance for any of our executives or employees other than Dr. Walker and Mr. Powala.. Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and clinical personnel and, if we progress the development of our drug pipeline toward scaling up for commercialization, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel, will also be critical to our success. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain marketing approval of and commercialize drugs. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.. 58. Table of Contents. We expect to expand our development and regulatory capabilities and implement sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.. As of December 31, 2017, we had 96 full-time and part-time employees. As our development progresses, we expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of drug development, regulatory affairs, sales, marketing and distribution. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.. Our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial collaborators, principal investigators, CROs and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements.. We are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial collaborators, principal investigators, CROs and vendors may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates FDA regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA, manufacturing standards, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, and laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by these parties could also involve the improper use of individually identifiable information, including, without limitation, information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we are subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of Confluence.. In August 2017, we acquired Confluence Life Sciences, Inc., or Confluence, including several preclinical drug candidates and Confluence's contract research services business. Acquisitions are inherently risky, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Confluence.  Specifically, we are subject to the risks that:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe fail to successfully develop or integrate Confluence's preclinical drug candidates into our pipeline in order to achieve our strategic objectives;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe are unable to adequately integrate or continue operating Confluence's contract research services business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe receive inadequate or unfavorable data from preclinical studies or clinical trials evaluating the acquired preclinical drug candidates; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour due diligence processes in connection with the acquisition failed to identify significant problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of Confluence, including problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges with respect to intellectual property, product quality and safety and other known and unknown liabilities.. 59. Table of Contents. If we are unable to successfully integrate Confluence's business and employees, it could have an adverse effect on our future results and the market price of our common stock.. The success of our acquisition of Confluence will depend, in large part, on our ability to realize operating synergies from combining our business with Confluence's business. To realize these anticipated benefits, we must successfully integrate Confluence's business and employees. This integration will be complex and time-consuming.. The failure to successfully integrate and manage the challenges presented by the integration process may result in our failure to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of the merger. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcomplexities associated with managing the larger combined company with distant business locations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tintegrating personnel from the two companies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcurrent and prospective employees may experience uncertainty regarding their future roles with our company, which might adversely affect our ability to retain, recruit and motivate key personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlost revenue and customers as a result of customers of Confluence's contract research services business deciding not to do business with the combined company;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the merger; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tperformance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the diversion of management's attention caused by completing the merger and integrating the companies' operations.. If any of these events were to occur, the ability of the combined company to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and employees or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger could be adversely affected, or could reduce our future earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results and, as a result, adversely affect the market price of our common stock.. Charges to earnings resulting from the acquisition of Confluence may cause our operating results to suffer.. Under accounting principles, we will allocate the total purchase price of the merger to Confluence's net tangible assets and intangible assets based on their fair values as of the date of the merger, and we will record the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. Our management's estimates of fair value will be based upon assumptions that they believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. The following factors, among others, could result in material charges that would cause our financial results to be negatively impacted:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timpairment of goodwill;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcharges for the amortization of identifiable intangible assets and for stock-based compensation; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\taccrual of newly identified pre-merger contingent liabilities that are identified subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation.. Additional costs may include costs of employee redeployment, relocation and retention, including salary increases or bonuses, taxes and termination of contracts that provide redundant or conflicting services. Some of these costs may have to be accounted for as expenses that would negatively impact our results of operations.. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock. An active trading market for our common stock may not continue to develop or be sustained.. Prior to our initial public offering in October 2015, there was no public market for our common stock. Although our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our shares will continue to develop or be sustained. If an active market for our common stock does not continue to develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult for investors in our common stock to sell shares without depressing the market price for the shares or to sell the shares at all.. 60. Table of Contents. The trading price of the shares of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile.. Since our initial public offering, our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe commencement, enrollment or results of any clinical trials we may conduct, or changes in the development status of our drug candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany delay in our regulatory filings for any of our drug candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authority's review of such filings, including without limitation the FDA's issuance of a \"refusal to file\" letter or a request for additional information;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse results from, delays in or termination of clinical trials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive marketing approval of our drug candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of ESKATA or any other drug candidate;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconditions or trends in our industry;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstock market price and volume fluctuations of comparable companies and, in particular, those that operate in the biotechnology industry;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpublication of research reports about us or our industry or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinvestors' general perception of our company and our business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trecruitment or departure of key personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toverall performance of the equity markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttrading volume of our common stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral political and economic conditions; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.. In addition, in the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies' stock. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources from our business.. If equity research analysts do not publish research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports, about us, our business or our market, our stock price and trading volume could decline.. The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. Equity research analysts may elect not to initiate or continue to provide research coverage of our common stock, and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Even if we have equity research analyst coverage, we will not have any control over the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.. 61. Table of Contents. The issuance of additional stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plan or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors. Subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations, we may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our equity incentive plan or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the market could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. If our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.. In addition, we have filed registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act registering the issuance of shares of common stock subject to options or other equity awards issued or reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans. Shares registered under these registration statements are available for sale in the public market subject to vesting arrangements and exercise of options, and the restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act in the case of our affiliates.. Additionally, certain holders of shares of our common stock, or their transferees, have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file one or more registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. If we were to register the resale of these shares, they could be freely sold in the public market. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.. Provisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to change our management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result.. There are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change of control was considered favorable by some or all of our stockholders. For example, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The board of directors can fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change of control transaction. As a result, the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders may be adversely affected. An issuance of shares of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to other stockholders.. Our charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tonly one of our three classes of directors is elected each year;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstockholders are not entitled to remove directors other than by a 662/3% vote and only for cause;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstockholders are not permitted to take actions by written consent;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstockholders cannot call a special meeting of stockholders; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings.. In addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions by prohibiting Delaware corporations from engaging in specified business combinations with particular stockholders of those companies. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change of control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management or limit the price that investors are willing to pay for our stock.. 62. Table of Contents. Concentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers, directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.. Our executive officers, directors and current beneficial owners of 5% or more of our common stock and their respective affiliates beneficially own a substantial portion of our common stock. As a result, these persons, acting together, would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors, any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other significant corporate transactions. The interests of this group of stockholders may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders.. We are an \"emerging growth company\" and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.. We are an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of some of the exemptions from reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbeing permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" disclosure in this report;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnot being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnot being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnot being required to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) December 31, 2020, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (3) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th and (4) any date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.. Under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.. If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the stock market on which our common stock is listed. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, and perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This requires that we incur substantial additional professional fees and internal costs to expand our accounting and finance functions and that we expend significant management efforts.. We may identify weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting will. 63. Table of Contents. not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.. If we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements, and we may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. If that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities.. We might not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards.. As of December 31, 2017, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $77.2 million and $119.3 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2032.  As of December 31, 2017, we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $2.2 million which begin to expire in 2032, and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $0.1 million which begin to expire in 2022. These net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change,\" which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited.  We have completed an analysis under Section 382 for net operating loss carryforwards generated from July 13, 2012 through December 31, 2016.  Although we have experienced Section 382 ownership changes since 2012, we have concluded that we should have sufficient ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards accumulated during the periods tested.  We have not yet determined if a Section 382 ownership change has occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017, or for Confluence prior to the acquisition.  In addition, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If we determine that an ownership change has occurred and our ability to use our historical net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.. The recently passed comprehensive tax reform bill could adversely affect our business and financial condition.. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law which significantly revised the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The newly enacted federal income tax law, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits.  Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.  In addition, it is uncertain how various states will respond to the newly enacted federal tax law.  The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse.  We urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to this legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our common stock.. We have broad discretion in the use of proceeds from our equity financing transactions and may invest or spend the proceeds in ways with which you do not agree and in ways that may not increase the value of your investment.. We have broad discretion over the use of proceeds from our equity financing transactions over the last several years. You may not agree with our decisions, and our use of the proceeds may not yield any return on your investment. We expect to use the net proceeds from those transactions to fund our research and development expenses and for working capital and general corporate purposes. Our failure to apply the net proceeds effectively could compromise our ability to pursue our strategy and we might not be able to yield a significant return, if any, on our investment of these net proceeds. Stockholders will not have the opportunity to influence our decisions on how to use these net proceeds.. 64. Table of Contents. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and our stock may not appreciate in value.. We have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock to date. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of any existing or future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or that the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares will be able to be maintained.. We will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of being a public company.. As a public company listed in the United States, we have begun, and will continue, particularly after we cease to be an \"emerging growth company,\" to incur significant additional legal, accounting and other costs. These additional costs could negatively affect our financial results. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market, may increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards, we fail to comply, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.. Failure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain some types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on committees of our board of directors or as members of senior management.. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition."
