[1] "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. We operate globally in challenging and highly competitive markets, and our business is subject to a variety of risks, including the risks described below, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, projected or assumed in forward-looking statements. You should carefully consider these risks when evaluating us and our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. We are also subject to a variety of risks that affect many other companies generally, as well as additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that, as of the date of this report, we believe are not as significant as the risks described below. If any of the following risks actually occur, the accuracy of any forward-looking statements made by us, including in this report, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the trading prices of our securities, may be materially and adversely affected.. We recently emerged from bankruptcy, which could adversely affect our business and relationships.. It is possible that our having filed for bankruptcy and our recent emergence from the Chapter 11 Case could adversely affect our business and relationships with vendors, suppliers, service providers, customers, employees and other third parties. Due to uncertainties, many risks exist, including the following:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tkey suppliers or vendors could terminate their relationship with us or require additional financial assurances or enhanced performance from us;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability to renew existing contracts and compete for new business may be adversely affected;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability to attract, motivate and/or retain key executives and employees may be adversely affected;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability to attract, motivate and/or retain employees may be adversely affected;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\temployees may be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other employment opportunities; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompetitors may take business away from us, and our ability to attract and retain customers may be negatively impacted.. The occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and reputation. We cannot assure you that having been subject to bankruptcy protection will not adversely affect our business or operations in the future.. In connection with the disclosure statement we filed with the Bankruptcy Court, and the hearing to consider confirmation of the Plan, we prepared projected financial information to demonstrate to the Bankruptcy Court the feasibility of the Plan and our ability to continue operations upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Those projections were prepared solely for the purpose of the bankruptcy proceedings and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis and should not be relied upon by investors. At the time they were prepared, the projections reflected numerous assumptions concerning our anticipated future performance with respect to prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our control and that may not materialize. Projections are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and the assumptions underlying the projections and/or valuation estimates may prove to be wrong in material respects. Actual results may vary significantly from those contemplated by the projections. As a result, investors should not rely on these projections.. The continuing downturn in the oil and gas industry has had a significant negative effect on our results of operations and revenues, our customers’ ability to pay and our profitability.. Demand for our vessels and services, and therefore our results of operations, are highly dependent on the level of spending and investment in offshore exploration, development and production by the companies that operate in the energy industry. The energy industry’s level of capital spending is directly related to current and expected future demand for hydrocarbons and the prevailing commodity prices of crude oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas. Hydrocarbon supply has increased at a faster pace than hydrocarbon demand, despite a significant decrease in exploration and development spending. This has resulted in significant declines in crude oil prices. When our customers experience low commodity prices or come to believe that they will be low in the future, they generally reduce their capital spending for offshore drilling, exploration and field development. The precipitous decline in crude oil prices that began in late 2014 and reached a 12-year low of less than $30/barrel in early 2016 resulted in a decrease in the energy industry’s level of capital spending. Although crude oil prices have improved from these low levels, if prices decline further or continue to remain depressed for an extended period of time, capital spending and demand for our services may remain similarly depressed. If certain major oil producing nations do not intend to reduce crude oil output the current over-supply environment may continue for the foreseeable future unless there is a significant increase in worldwide demand, which may not occur or may occur very slowly. These market conditions negatively affected our 2017 results and are expected to continue to significantly affect future results, particularly if exploration and production activity levels and, therefore, demand for our products and services, as well as our customers’ ability to pay, remain depressed or continue to decline. The decrease in demand for offshore services could cause the industry to experience a prolonged downturn. These conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. 20. We rely on the oil and natural gas industry, and volatile oil and natural gas prices impact demand for our services.. Demand for our services depends on activity in offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production. The level of exploration, development and production activity is affected by factors such as:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprevailing oil and natural gas prices;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpectations about future prices and price volatility;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tworldwide supply and demand for oil and gas;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of economic activity in energy-consuming markets;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe worldwide economic environment, trends in international trade or other economic trends, such as recessions;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to set and maintain production levels and pricing;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of production in non-OPEC countries;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinternational sanctions on oil producing countries and the lifting of certain sanctions against Iran;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcivil unrest and the worldwide political and military environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities involving the Middle East, Russia, other oil-producing regions or other geographic areas or further acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treallocation of drilling budgets away from offshore drilling in favor of other priorities, such as shale or other land-based projects;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsale and expiration dates of available offshore leases;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdemand for petroleum products;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcurrent availability of oil and natural gas resources;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trate of discovery of new oil and natural gas reserves in offshore areas;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlocal and international political, environmental and economic conditions;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in laws and regulations;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttechnological advances;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tability of oil and natural gas companies to obtain leases and permits, or obtain funds for capital expenditures; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelopment and exploitation of alternative fuels or energy sources.. An increase in commodity demand and prices will not necessarily result in an immediate increase in offshore drilling activity since our customers’ project development times, reserve replacement needs, expectations of future commodity demand, prices and supply of available competing vessels all combine to affect demand for our vessels. The level of offshore exploration, development and production activity has historically been characterized by volatility, and that volatility is likely to continue. The decline in exploration and development of offshore areas has resulted in a decline in the demand for our offshore marine services and may continue to do so or may worsen. Any such decrease in activity is likely to reduce our day rates and our utilization rates and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. If we are unable to generate enough cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness or are unable to use future borrowings to fund other capital needs, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, which may have onerous terms or may be unavailable.. If our business does not generate cash flow from operations in the future that is sufficient to service our outstanding indebtedness and other capital needs, we cannot assure you that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other capital needs. If operational performance does not improve significantly and oil companies do not increase spending for exploration and production activities, we expect to need additional sources of liquidity as a result of an inability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our long-term capital needs. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, and if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to satisfy our debt obligations and other capital needs, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trefinancing or restructuring all or a portion of our debt;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtaining alternative financing;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tselling assets;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treducing or delaying capital investments;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tseeking to raise additional capital; or. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trevising or delaying our strategic plans.. We cannot assure you, however, that we would be able to implement alternative financing plans, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that undertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, would allow us to meet our debt obligations and capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our debt instruments. In addition, any effort to implement alternative financing plans would result in diversion of management time and focus away from operating our business and could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.. 21. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow in the future to satisfy our debt obligations or to obtain alternative financing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Any failure to make required or scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms. Further, if for any reason we are unable to satisfy our covenants, debt service or repayment obligations, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such debt, which, if not remedied or waived, would allow our creditors to declare all such outstanding indebtedness to be due and payable. The lenders under our credit agreement would have the right to terminate their commitments to loan money, and such lenders could foreclose against our assets securing their borrowings, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Condition – Emergence from Bankruptcy - Exit Credit Facility” and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.. Our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, which could make us unable to fund our capital requirements.. Our business and operations may consume resources faster than we anticipate. In the future, we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of new equity securities, debt or a combination of both. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our capital requirements. If we issue new secured debt securities, the secured debt holders would have rights senior to holders of Common Stock to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any additional debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our Common Stock. If we issue additional equity securities, existing stockholders may experience dilution. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock which could have rights and preferences senior to those of our Common Stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our security holders bear the risk of our future securities offerings reducing the market price of our Common Stock or other securities, diluting their interest or being subject to rights and preferences senior to their own.. We may be unable to maintain compliance with financial ratio covenants in our outstanding indebtedness which could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our credit agreement requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants, including the following:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tminimum liquidity covenants of at least $15,000,000 in cash and $30,000,000 minimum liquidity;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta leverage ratio (total debt to 12 months EBITDA) of not more than 5.0 to 1.0, tested quarterly beginning December 31, 2020;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta total debt to capital ratio, tested quarterly, not to exceed 0.45 to 1.0; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta collateral to commitment coverage ratio (the ratio of aggregate collateral vessels’ fair market value to the total outstanding amount, including commitments, of the facilities under our credit agreement) of at least 2.50 to 1.0.. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with our financial covenants; however, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply with such terms at all times in the future. A failure to comply with the financial covenants in our credit agreement that is not waived by our lenders or otherwise cured could lead to a termination of our credit agreement or acceleration of all amounts due under our credit agreement, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These restrictions may limit our ability to obtain future financings to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities.. Our credit agreement contains a number of covenants that limit our ability to make dispositions or investments, incur additional indebtedness and engage in other transactions, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our future goals.. Our credit agreement contains a number of covenants that limit our operational flexibility. The sale of collateral vessels that are pledged to secure our obligations under our credit agreement is subject to various restrictions and will trigger payment of a prepayment premium if made during the applicable premium payment period. Collateral vessel operations are also subject to a variety of restrictive provisions, including customary provisions related to vessel flag, registry, safety standards, environmental compliance, insurance, technical and commercial management, joint venture activities, modification limits, chartering scope limits, survey and inspection requirements, and other limitations. Proceeds of the facilities under our credit agreement may not be used to acquire vessels or finance business acquisitions generally.. 22. Under our credit agreement, we are also subject to restrictions on:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadditional indebtedness;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadditional liens on assets;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinvestments;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmergers and acquisitions;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvessel dispositions;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tjoint ventures;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvessel classification maintenance;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdistributions to equity holders;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\taffiliate transactions;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tleasing limits; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother customary matters.. Our credit agreement also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants as discussed above. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreement. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under our credit agreement would also have the right in these circumstances to cancel any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. If we are unable to repay our indebtedness when due or declared due, the lenders thereunder would also have the right to proceed against the vessels and other collateral pledged to them to secure the indebtedness. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations that the restrictive covenants under our indebtedness impose on us.. We may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts for our vessels.. We have a number of charters that will expire in 2018. Our ability to renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts, and the terms of any such contracts, will depend on various factors, including market conditions and the specific needs of our customers. Given the highly competitive and historically cyclical nature of our industry, we may not be able to renew or replace the contracts or we may be required to renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts at rates that are below, and potentially substantially below, existing day rates, or that have terms that are less favorable to us than our existing contracts, or we may be unable to secure contracts for these vessels. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. Our industry is highly competitive, which could depress vessel prices and utilization and adversely affect our financial performance.. We operate in a competitive industry. The principal competitive factors in the marine support and transportation services industry include:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprice, service and reputation of vessel operations and crews;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnational flag preference;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toperating conditions;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuitability of vessel types;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvessel availability;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttechnical capabilities of equipment and personnel;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsafety and efficiency;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcomplexity of maintaining logistical support; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcost of moving equipment from one market to another.. In addition, an expansion in the supply of vessels in the regions in which we compete, whether through new vessel construction, the refurbishment of older vessels, or the conversion of vessels, could lower charter rates, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we have. Competitive bidding and downward pressures on profits and pricing margins could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. An increase in the supply of offshore supply vessels would likely have a negative effect on charter rates for our vessels, which could reduce our earnings.. Our industry is highly competitive, with oversupply and intense price competition. Charter rates for marine supply vessels depend in part on the supply of the vessels. We could experience an increased reduction in demand as a result of the current oversupply of vessels. Excess vessel capacity has resulted from:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconstructing new vessels;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmoving vessels from one offshore market area to another;. 23. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconverting vessels formerly dedicated to services other than offshore marine services; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdeclining offshore oil and gas drilling production activities.. In the past decade, construction of vessels of the types we operate has increased. Significant new OSV construction and upgrades of existing OSVs have intensified price competition. The resulting increase in OSV supply has depressed OSV utilization and intensified price competition from both existing competitors, as well as new entrants into the offshore vessel supply market. As of the date of this report, not all of the vessels currently under construction have been contracted for future work, which may further intensify price competition as scheduled delivery dates occur. Such price competition could further reduce day rates, utilization rates and operating margins, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. As the markets recover or we change our marketing strategies or for other reasons, we may be required to incur higher than expected costs to return previously stacked vessels to class.. Stacked vessels are not maintained with the same diligence as our marketed fleet. Depending on the length of time the vessels are stacked, we may incur costs beyond normal drydock costs to return these vessels to active service. These costs are difficult to estimate and may be substantial.. We have been adversely affected by a decrease in offshore oil and gas drilling as a result of unconventional crude oil and unconventional natural gas production and the improved economics of producing natural gas and oil from shale.. The rise in production of unconventional crude oil and gas resources in North America and the commissioning of a number of new large liquefied natural gas export facilities around the world are, at least to date, primarily contributing to an over-supplied natural gas market. While production of crude oil and natural gas from unconventional sources is still a relatively small portion of the worldwide crude oil and natural gas production, production from unconventional resources is increasing because improved drilling efficiencies are lowering the costs of extraction. There is an oversupply of natural gas inventories in the United States in part due to the increased development of unconventional crude oil and natural gas resources. Prolonged increases in the worldwide supply of crude oil and natural gas, whether from conventional or unconventional sources, will likely continue to depress crude oil and natural gas prices. Prolonged periods of low natural gas prices have a negative impact on development plans of exploration and production companies, which in turn, results in a decrease in demand for offshore support vessel services. The rise in production of natural gas and oil, particularly from onshore shale, as a result of improved drilling efficiencies that are lowering the costs of extraction, has resulted in a reduction of capital invested in offshore oil and gas exploration. Because we provide vessels servicing offshore oil and gas exploration, the significant reduction in investments in offshore exploration and development has had a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.. The ownership position of our significant stockholders limits other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and could affect the price of our Common Stock.. As of March 30, 2018, based on their most recent Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G filings, Raging Capital Management, LLC beneficially owned 32.7% of our outstanding Common Stock, Captain Q, LLC beneficially owned 16.2% of our outstanding Common Stock and Canyon Capital Advisors LLC beneficially owned 15.4% of our Common Stock, which in total represents approximately 64.3% of our outstanding Common Stock. While these stockholders are not a group, these three stockholders in and of themselves have the ability to influence significantly all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other significant corporate transactions. These three stockholders may have interests that differ from other stockholders, and they may each vote in a way with which other stockholders disagree and one or more of them may be adverse in the future to the interests of other stockholders. The concentration of ownership of our Common Stock may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their Common Stock as part of a sale of our company, and may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. This concentration of ownership of our Common Stock may also have the effect of influencing the completion of a change in control that may not necessarily be in the best interests of all of our stockholders.. Due to the continuous evolution of laws and regulations in the various markets in which we operate, we may be restricted or even lose the right to operate in certain international markets where we currently have a presence.. Many of the countries in which we operate have laws, regulations and enforcement systems that are largely undeveloped, and the requirements of these systems are not always readily discernible even to experienced operators. Further, these laws, regulations and enforcement systems can be subject to frequent change or reinterpretation, sometimes with retroactive effect, and taxes, fees, fines or penalties may be sought from us based on such a reinterpretation or retroactive effect. While we endeavor to comply with applicable laws and regulations, our compliance efforts might not always be wholly successful, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions, imposition of remedial obligations or the suspension or termination of our operations in the jurisdiction. In addition, laws and regulations could be changed or be interpreted in new, unexpected ways that substantially increase our costs, which we may not be able to pass through to our customers. Any changes in laws, regulations or standards that would impose additional costs, requirements or restrictions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.. 24. A decrease in our customer base could adversely affect demand for our services and reduce our revenues.. We derive a significant amount of our revenue from a small number of offshore energy companies. Our loss of one of these significant customers, if not offset by sales to new or other existing customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in recent years, oil and natural gas companies, energy companies and drilling contractors have undergone substantial consolidation and additional consolidation is possible. Consolidation results in fewer companies to charter or contract for our services. Also, merger activity among both major and independent oil and natural gas companies affects exploration, development and production activity as the consolidated companies integrate operations to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Less promising exploration and development projects of a combined company may be dropped or delayed. Such activity may result in an exploration and development budget for a combined company that is lower than the total budget of both companies before consolidation, which could adversely affect demand for our vessels and thereby reduce our revenues.. Maintaining our current fleet size and configuration and acquiring vessels required for additional future growth require significant capital.. Expenditures required for the repair, certification and maintenance of a vessel typically increase with vessel age. These expenditures may increase to a level at which they are not economically justifiable and, therefore, to maintain our current fleet size we may seek to construct or acquire additional vessels. Also, customers may prefer modern vessels over older vessels, especially in weaker markets. The cost of adding a new vessel to our fleet can be substantial.. While we expect our cash on hand, cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our credit agreement to be adequate to fund our existing commitments, our ability to pay these amounts is dependent upon the success of our operations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Condition – Emergence from Bankruptcy - Exit Credit Facility” included in Part II, Item 7. We can give no assurance that we will have sufficient capital resources to build or acquire the vessels required to expand or to maintain our current fleet size and vessel configuration.. We are subject to hazards customary for the operation of vessels that could adversely affect our financial performance if we are not adequately insured or indemnified.. Our operations are subject to various operating hazards and risks, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcatastrophic marine disaster;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse sea and weather conditions;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmechanical failure;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnavigation errors;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcollision;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toil and hazardous substance spills, containment and clean up;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlabor shortages and strikes;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdamage to and loss of drilling rigs and production facilities;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twar, sabotage, piracy, cyber-attack and terrorism risks; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toutbreak of contagious disease.. These risks present a threat to the safety of our personnel and to our vessels, cargo, equipment under tow and other property, as well as the environment. We could be required to suspend our operations or request that others suspend their operations as a result of these hazards. In such event, we would experience loss of revenue and possibly property damage, and additionally, third parties may make significant claims against us for damages due to personal injury, death, property damage, pollution and loss of business.. We maintain insurance coverage against many of the casualty and liability risks listed above, subject to deductibles and certain exclusions. We have renewed our primary insurance program for the insurance year 2018/2019. We can provide no assurance, however, that our insurance coverage will be available beyond the renewal periods, or that it will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise. Claims covered by insurance are subject to deductibles, the aggregate amount of which could be material. Insurance policies are also subject to compliance with certain conditions, the failure of which could lead to a denial of coverage as to a particular claim or the voiding of a particular insurance policy. There also can be no assurance that existing insurance coverage can be renewed at commercially reasonable rates or that available coverage will be adequate to cover future claims. If a loss occurs that is partially or completely uninsured, we could be exposed to substantial liability that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. 25. We may not be fully indemnified by our customers for damage to their property or the property of their other contractors. Our contracts are individually negotiated, and the levels of indemnity and allocation of liabilities in them can vary from contract to contract depending on market conditions, particular customer requirements and other factors existing at the time a contract is negotiated. Additionally, the enforceability of indemnification provisions in our contracts may be limited or prohibited by applicable law or may not be enforced by courts having jurisdiction, and we could be held liable for substantial losses or damages and for fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities. The indemnification provisions of our contracts may be subject to differing interpretations, and the laws or courts of certain jurisdictions may enforce such provisions while other laws or courts may find them to be unenforceable, void or limited by public policy considerations, including when the cause of the underlying loss or damage is our gross negligence or willful misconduct, when punitive damages are attributable to us or when fines or penalties are imposed directly against us. The law with respect to the enforceability of indemnities varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Current or future litigation in particular jurisdictions, whether or not we are a party, may impact the interpretation and enforceability of indemnification provisions in our contracts. There can be no assurance that our contracts with our customers, suppliers and subcontractors will fully protect us against all hazards and risks inherent in our operations. There can also be no assurance that those parties with contractual obligations to indemnify us will be financially able to do so or will otherwise honor their contractual obligations.. Failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws may have an adverse effect on us.. Our international operations require us to comply with a number of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those involving anti-bribery and anti-corruption. We do business and may do additional business in the future in countries and regions where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may not be customary. In order to effectively operate in certain foreign jurisdictions, circumstances may require that we establish joint ventures with local operators or find strategic partners. As a U.S. company, we are subject to the regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or obtaining an improper business benefit. We have an ongoing program of proactive procedures to promote compliance with the FCPA and other similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, but we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners or agents even though these partners or agents may not themselves be subjected to the FCPA or other similar laws.  Our personnel and intermediaries, including our local operators and strategic partners, may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by government officials, political parties and officials, tribal or insurgent organizations, or private entities in the countries in which we operate or may operate in the future.  As a result, we face the risk that an unauthorized payment or offer of payment could be made by one of our employees or intermediaries, even if such parties are not always subject to our control or are not themselves subject to the FCPA or other similar laws to which we may be subject. Any allegation that we have violated the FCPA or other similar laws or any determination that we have violated the FCPA or other similar laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and cash flows.. Our Common Stock is subject to restrictions on non-U.S. Citizen ownership and possible required divestiture by non-U.S. Citizen stockholders.. Certain of our operations are conducted in the Coastwise Trade and are governed by U.S. federal laws commonly known as the Jones Act. The Jones Act restricts waterborne transportation of merchandise and passengers for hire between points in the United States to vessels owned and operated by U.S. Citizens. We could lose the privilege of owning and operating vessels in the Coastwise Trade and may become subject to penalties and risk seizure and forfeiture of our U.S.-flag vessels if non-U.S. Citizens were to own or control, in the aggregate, more than 25% of any class or series of our capital stock. Such loss would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws authorize our Board of Directors to establish with respect to any class or series of our capital stock certain rules, policies and procedures, including procedures with respect to transfer of shares, to ensure compliance with the Jones Act. In order to provide a reasonable margin for compliance with the Jones Act, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation contains provisions that limit the aggregate percentage ownership by non-U.S. Citizens of any class or series of our capital stock (including the Common Stock) to 24% of the outstanding shares of each such class or series to ensure that ownership by non-U.S. Citizens will not exceed the maximum percentage permitted by the Jones Act (presently 25%). On the Effective Date, the maximum percentage of shares of Common Stock held by non-U.S. Citizens allowable under such provisions was reached. At and during such time that the limit is reached with respect to shares of Common Stock, we will be unable to issue any further shares of Common Stock or permit transfers of Common Stock to non-U.S. Citizens. Any issuance or transfer of shares in excess of such permitted percentage shall be ineffective as against us and neither we nor our transfer agent is required to register such purported issuance or transfer of shares or required to recognize the purported transferee or owner as a stockholder of our company for any purpose whatsoever except to exercise our remedies. Any such excess shares in the hands of a non-U.S. Citizen shall not have any voting or dividend rights and are subject to redemption by our company at a redemption price that may be paid in redemption warrants, cash or promissory notes at the discretion of our Board of Directors. As a result of these provisions, a purported stockholder who is not a U.S. Citizen may not receive any return on its investment in any such excess shares. Further, we may have to incur additional indebtedness, or use available cash (if any), to fund all or a portion of such redemption, in which case our financial condition may be materially weakened. The existence and enforcement of these requirements could have an adverse impact on the liquidity or market value of our equity securities in the event that U.S. Citizens were unable to transfer shares in our company to non-U.S. Citizens. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, this ownership restriction could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company.. 26. So that we may ensure compliance with the Jones Act, provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation permit us to require that owners of any shares of our capital stock provide confirmation of their citizenship. In the event that a person does not submit such documentation to us, those provisions provide us with certain remedies, including the suspension of voting and dividend rights and treatment of such person as a non-U.S. Citizen unless and until we receive the requested documentation confirming that such person is a U.S. Citizen. As a result of non-compliance with these provisions, an owner of the shares of our Common Stock may lose significant rights associated with those shares.. Our business could be adversely affected if we do not comply with the Jones Act.. We are subject to the Jones Act, which requires that vessels carrying merchandise or passengers for hire in Coastwise Trade be owned and operated by U.S. Citizens, be built in and registered under the laws of the United States, and manned by predominantly U.S. Citizen crews. Violations of the Jones Act would result in our losing eligibility to engage in Coastwise Trade, the imposition of substantial penalties against us, including fines and seizure and forfeiture of our vessels, and/or the inability to register our vessels in the United States with coastwise endorsements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we currently believe we meet the requirements to engage in Coastwise Trade, and there are provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws that were designed to assist us in complying with these requirements, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with the Jones Act in the future.. Circumvention or repeal of the Jones Act may have an adverse impact on us.. The Jones Act’s provisions restricting Coastwise Trade to vessels owned and operated by U.S. Citizens may from time to time be circumvented by foreign interests that seek to engage in trade reserved for U.S.-flag vessels owned and operated by U.S. Citizens and otherwise qualifying for Coastwise Trade. Legal challenges against such actions are difficult, costly to pursue and are of uncertain outcome. There have also been attempts to repeal or amend the Jones Act, and these attempts are expected to continue. In addition, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security may waive the requirement for using U.S.-flag vessels with coastwise endorsements in the Coastwise Trade in the interest of national defense. Furthermore, the Jones Act restrictions on the maritime cabotage services are subject to certain exceptions under certain international trade agreements, including the General Agreement on Trade in Services and the North American Free Trade Agreement. If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the North American Free Trade Agreement or other international trade agreements, the shipping of maritime cargo between covered U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flag, foreign-built vessels or foreign-owned vessels. To the extent foreign competition is permitted from vessels built in lower-cost shipyards and crewed by non-U.S. Citizens with favorable tax regimes and with lower wages and benefits, such competition could have a material adverse effect on domestic companies, such as ours, in the offshore service vessel industry subject to the Jones Act.. Our U.S.-flag vessels may be requisitioned or purchased by the United States in the event of a national emergency or a threat to security.. We are subject to the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, which provides that, upon proclamation by the President of a national emergency or a threat to the security of the national defense, the Secretary of Transportation may requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by United States citizens (which includes United States corporations), including vessels under construction in the United States. If our vessels were purchased or requisitioned by the federal government, we would be entitled to be paid just compensation, which is generally the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or, in the case of a requisition, the fair market value of charter hire, but we would not be entitled to be compensated for any consequential damages we suffer. The purchase or the requisition for an extended period of time of one or more of our vessels could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.. We are subject to war, sabotage, piracy, cyber-attacks and terrorism risk.. War, sabotage, pirate, cyber and terrorist attacks or any similar risk may adversely affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including changes in the insurance markets, disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, production facilities, refineries, electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, offshore rigs and vessels, and communications infrastructures, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, a cyber-attack or an act of piracy or terror. War or risk of war or any such attack may also have an adverse effect on the economy, which could adversely affect activity in offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production and the demand for our services. Insurance coverage can be difficult to obtain in areas of pirate and terrorist attacks resulting in increased costs that could continue to increase. We periodically evaluate the need to maintain this insurance coverage as it applies to our fleet. Instability in the financial markets as a result of war, sabotage, piracy, cyber-attacks or terrorism could also adversely affect our ability to raise capital and could also adversely affect the oil, natural gas and power industries and restrict their future growth.. 27. A failure in our operational systems or cyber security attacks on any of our facilities, or those of third parties, may adversely affect our financial results.. Our business is dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions.  If any of our financial, operational, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be adversely affected.  Our financial results could also be adversely affected if an employee or other third party causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our operational systems.  In addition, dependence upon automated systems may further increase the risk that operational system flaws, employee or other tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.. Due to increasing technological advances, we have become more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our business.  We use computer programs to help run our financial and operations sectors, and this may subject our business to increased risks.  Any cyber security attacks that affect our facilities or operations, our customers or any financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business.  In addition, cyber-attacks on our customer and employee data may result in a financial loss and may negatively impact our reputation.  Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer such attacks or operational system failures.  Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business, result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, operations and financial results.. Our tax expense and effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could be higher if there are changes in tax legislation in countries where we operate, if we lose our tonnage tax qualifications or tax exemptions, if we increase our operations in high tax jurisdictions where we operate, if there are changes in the mix of income and losses we recognize in tax jurisdictions and/or if we elect to repatriate cash from our foreign operations in amounts higher than recent years.. Our worldwide operations are conducted through our various domestic and foreign subsidiaries and as a result we are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Any material changes in tax laws and related regulations, tax treaties or their interpretations where we have significant operations could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and a materially higher tax expense.. For example, our North Sea operations based in the U.K. and Norway have special tax incentives for qualified shipping operations, commonly referred to as tonnage tax, which provides for a tax based on the net tonnage capacity of qualified vessels, resulting in significantly lower taxes than those that would apply if we were not a qualified shipping company in those jurisdictions. There is no guarantee that current tonnage tax regimes will not be changed or modified which could, along with any of the above-mentioned factors, materially adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our business, operating results and financial condition. Our U.K. and Norway tonnage tax companies are subject to specific disqualification triggers, which, if we fail to manage them, could jeopardize our qualified tonnage tax status in those countries. Certain of the disqualification events or actions are coupled with one or more opportunities to cure or otherwise maintain the tonnage tax qualification but not all are curable. Our qualified Singapore-based vessels are exempt from Singapore taxation through December 2027, with extensions available in certain circumstances beyond 2027, but there is no assurance that extensions will be granted. The qualified Singapore vessels are also subject to specific qualification requirements which, if not met, could jeopardize our qualified status in Singapore.. In addition, our worldwide operations may change in the future such that the mix of our income and losses recognized in the various jurisdictions could change. Any such changes could reduce our ability to utilize tax benefits, such as foreign tax credits, and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and tax expense.. We may have higher than anticipated tax liabilities.. We conduct business globally and file income tax returns in various tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in income before taxes in various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanging tax laws, regulations, and/or interpretations of such tax laws in multiple jurisdictions;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teffect of tax rate on accounting for acquisitions and dispositions;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tissues arising from tax audit or examinations and any related interest or penalties; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tuncertainty in obtaining tax holiday extensions or expiration or loss of tax holidays in various jurisdictions.. 28. We report our results of operations based on our determination of the amount of taxes owed in various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation, judgment and calculations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain. Our determination of tax liability is always subject to review or examination by tax authorities in various tax jurisdictions. Any adverse outcome of such review or examination could have a negative impact on our operating results and financial condition. The results from various tax examinations and audits may differ from the liabilities recorded in our financial statements and could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows.. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the statute originally named the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the 2017 Tax Act or TCJA. The TCJA contains significant changes to U.S. federal corporate income taxation, including a reduction of the federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% for U.S. taxable income, which results in a one-time remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the newly enacted statutory rate of 21%. The 2017 Tax Act also includes a new limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, deemed repatriation resulting in one-time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates, the elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), and immediate expensing of qualified capital expenditures. We are currently evaluating the overall effect of the TCJA on our business and financial condition.. Adverse results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us.. We are subject to and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Irrespective of its merits, litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to our operations and may require significant expenditures and cause diversion of management attention. We may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could materially adversely affect a portion of our business operations or materially and adversely affect our financial position and our results of operations should we fail to prevail in such matters.. The ability to attract, recruit and retain key personnel is critical to the success of our business and may be affected by our U.S. Citizen requirements and our emergence from bankruptcy.. We depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key management personnel. There is no assurance that these individuals will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key management personnel could adversely affect our operations.. Our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that our chairman of the board and chief executive officer, by whatever title, must be U.S. Citizens. In addition, our Amended and Restated Bylaws specify that not more than a minority of directors comprising the minimum number of members of the Board of Directors necessary to constitute a quorum of the Board of Directors (or such other portion as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to comply with the Jones Act) may be non-U.S. Citizens. Our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide for similar U.S. Citizen requirements with regard to committees of the Board of Directors. As a result, we may be unable to allow a non-U.S. Citizen, who would otherwise be qualified, to serve as a director or as our chairman of the board or chief executive officer.. The ability to attract and retain key personnel may also be difficult in light of our emergence from bankruptcy, the uncertainties currently facing the business and changes we may make to the organizational structure to adjust to changing circumstances. We may need to enter into retention or other arrangements that could be costly to maintain. If executives, managers or other key personnel resign, retire or are terminated or their service is otherwise interrupted, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner and we could experience significant declines in productivity.. Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.. Certain provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders. These provisions provide for, among other things:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue, and determine the rights, powers and preferences of, one or more series of preferred stock;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadvance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimitations on convening special stockholder meetings;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability for issuance of additional shares of Common Stock; and. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions on the ability of any natural person or entity that does not satisfy the citizenship requirements of the U.S. maritime laws to own, in the aggregate, more than 24% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock.. 29. These anti-takeover provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our Common Stock and other securities. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.. We may not be able to sell vessels to improve our cash flow and liquidity because we may be unable to locate buyers with access to financing or to complete any sales on acceptable terms or within a reasonable timeframe.. We may seek to sell some of our vessels to provide liquidity and cash flow. However, given the current downturn in the oil and gas industry, there may not be sufficient activity in the market to sell our vessels and we may not be able to identify buyers with access to financing or to complete any such sales. Even if we are able to locate appropriate buyers for our vessels, any sales may occur on significantly less favorable terms than the terms that might be available in a more liquid market or at other times in the business cycle.. The early termination of contracts on our vessels could have an adverse effect on our operations and our backlog may not be converted to actual operating results for any future period.. Most of the long-term contracts for our vessels and all contracts with governmental entities and national oil companies contain early termination options in favor of the customer, in some cases permitting termination for any reason. Although some of these contracts have early termination remedies in our favor or other provisions designed to discourage the customers from exercising such options, we cannot assure you that our customers would not choose to exercise their termination rights in spite of such remedies or the threat of litigation with us. Moreover, most of the contracts for our vessels have a term of one year or less and can be terminated with 90 days or less notice. Until replacement of such business with other customers, any termination could temporarily disrupt our business or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We might not be able to replace such business or replace it on economically equivalent terms. In those circumstances, the amount of backlog could be reduced and the conversion of backlog into revenue could be impaired. Additionally, because of depressed commodity prices, restricted credit markets, economic downturns, changes in priorities or strategy or other factors beyond our control, a customer may no longer want or need a vessel that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at a lower rate. For these reasons, customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of our existing contracts, terminate our contracts without justification or repudiate or otherwise fail to perform their obligations under our contracts. In any case, an early termination of a contract may result in our vessel being idle for an extended period of time. Each of these results could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. We may be unable to collect amounts owed to us by our customers.. We typically grant our customers credit on a short-term basis. Related credit risks are inherent as we do not typically collateralize receivables due from customers. We provide estimates for uncollectible accounts based primarily on our judgment using historical losses, current economic conditions and individual evaluations of each customer as evidence supporting the receivables valuations stated on our financial statements. However, our receivables valuation estimates may not be accurate and receivables due from customers reflected in our financial statements may not be collectible. Our inability to perform under our contractual obligations, or our customers’ inability or unwillingness to fulfill their contractual commitments to us, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. Our international operations are vulnerable to currency exchange rate fluctuations and exchange rate risks.. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and exchange rate risks as a result of our foreign operations. To reduce the financial impact of these risks, we attempt to match the currency of our debt and operating costs with the currency of the revenue streams. Because we conduct a large portion of our operations in foreign currencies, any increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the value of applicable foreign currencies could adversely affect our operating revenue or construction costs when translated into U.S. Dollars.. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from our international operations which are subject to foreign government regulation and operating risks.. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from foreign sources. We therefore face risks inherent in conducting business internationally, such as:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlegal and governmental regulatory requirements;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlanguage and cultural differences;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential vessel seizure or nationalization of assets;. 30. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timport-export quotas or other trade barriers;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical and economic instability;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges to shipping tax regimes;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trisk arising from counterparty conduct;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timposition of currency exchange controls; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotentially adverse tax consequences.. We cannot predict whether any such conditions or events might develop in the future or whether they might have a material effect on our operations. Our ability to compete in international markets may be adversely affected by foreign government regulations, such as regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local competitors, or that require foreign persons to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction.. Our subsidiary structure and our operations are in part based on certain assumptions about various foreign and domestic tax laws, currency exchange requirements and capital repatriation laws. While we believe our assumptions are correct, there can be no assurance that taxing or other authorities will reach the same conclusions. If our assumptions are incorrect or if the relevant countries change or modify such laws or the current interpretation of such laws, we may suffer adverse tax and financial consequences, including the reduction of cash flow available to meet required debt service and other obligations.. U.S. federal income tax reform could adversely affect us.. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the 2017 Tax Act, which enacts a broad range of changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The 2017 Tax Act, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest and net operating losses, allows for the expensing of certain capital expenditures, and puts into effect a number of changes impacting operations outside of the United States including, but not limited to, the imposition of a one-time tax on accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income that has not previously been subject to U.S. taxation, and possible U.S. tax implications associated with the treatment of certain foreign earnings. We continue to examine the impact this tax legislation may have on our business.. The overall impact of the 2017 Tax Act on our future financial results is subject to uncertainties and our financial results could be adversely impacted by certain aspects of the 2017 Tax Act, allowing a domestic corporation an immediate deduction in U.S. taxable income for a portion of its foreign-derived intangible income, and the base erosion anti-abuse tax. These factors could result in our 2018 provisional income tax expense effective tax rate to differ from our expectations.. Doing business through joint venture operations may require us to surrender some control over our assets and may lead to disruptions in our operations and business.. We operate in several foreign areas through joint ventures with local companies, in some cases because of local laws requiring local company ownership. While the joint venture partner may provide local knowledge and experience, entering into joint ventures often requires us to surrender a measure of control over the assets and operations devoted to the joint venture, and occasions may arise when we do not agree with the business goals and objectives of our joint venture partner, or other factors may arise that make the continuation of the relationship unwise or untenable. Any such disagreements or discontinuation of the relationship could disrupt our operations, put assets dedicated to the joint venture at risk, or adversely affect the continuity of our business. If we are unable to resolve issues with a joint venture partner, we may decide to terminate the joint venture and either locate a different partner and continue to work in the area or seek opportunities for our assets in another market. The unwinding of an existing joint venture could prove to be difficult or time-consuming, and the loss of revenue related to the termination or unwinding of a joint venture and costs related to the sourcing of a new partner or the mobilization of assets to another market could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.. Vessel enhancement, repair and drydock projects are subject to risks, including delays, cost overruns, and ship yard insolvencies which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.. Our vessel enhancement, repair and drydock projects are subject to risks, including delay and cost overruns, inherent in any large construction project, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshortages of equipment;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunforeseen engineering problems;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twork stoppages;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlack of shipyard availability;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tweather interference;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunanticipated cost increases;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshortages of materials or skilled labor; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinsolvency of the ship repairer or ship builder.. 31. Significant cost overruns or delays in connection with our vessel construction, enhancement, repair and drydock projects could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Significant delays could also result, under certain circumstances, in penalties under, or the termination of, long-term contracts under which our vessels operate. The demand for vessels we construct may diminish from anticipated levels, or we may experience difficulty in acquiring new vessels or obtaining equipment to repair our older vessels due to high demand, and both circumstances may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. Recent global economic issues may increase the risk of insolvency of ship builders and ship repairers, which could adversely affect the cost of new construction and the vessel repairs and could result, under certain circumstances, in penalties under, or termination of, long-term contracts relating to vessels under construction.. The operations of our fleet may be subject to seasonal factors.. Operations in the North Sea are generally at their highest levels during the months from April through August and at their lowest levels from December through February, primarily due to lower construction activity and harsh weather conditions during the winter months affecting the movement of drilling rigs. Vessels operating offshore Southeast Asia are generally at their lowest utilization rates during the monsoon season, which moves across the Asian continent between September and early March. The monsoon season for a specific Southeast Asian location generally lasts about two months. Activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, like the North Sea, is often slower during the winter months when construction projects and other specialized jobs are most difficult, and during the hurricane season from June through November. Operations in any market may be affected by seasonality often related to unusually long or short construction seasons due to, among other things, abnormal weather conditions, as well as market demand associated with changes in drilling and development activities.. Upon our emergence from bankruptcy, the composition of our Board of Directors changed significantly.. Pursuant to the Plan, the composition of our Board of Directors changed significantly upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Our Board is now made up of seven directors, with a new non-executive Chairman of the Board, and six of whom did not previously serve on our Board. The new directors have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on our Board and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine the future of our company. There is no guarantee that the new Board will pursue, or will pursue in the same manner, our strategic plans in the same manner as our prior Board. As a result, our future strategy and plans may differ materially from those of the past.. Government regulation and environmental risks can reduce our business opportunities, increase our costs, and adversely affect the manner or feasibility of doing business.. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject. We maintain a robust compliance program to ensure that we maintain and update our programs to meet or exceed regulatory requirements in the areas which we operate. However, we are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the form of international conventions, federal, state and local laws and laws and regulations in jurisdictions where our vessels operate and are registered. The risks of incurring substantial compliance costs and liabilities and penalties for noncompliance are inherent in offshore marine service operations. Compliance with the Jones Act, as well as with environmental, occupational, health and safety, and vessel and port security laws, can reduce our business opportunities and increase our costs of doing business. Additionally, these laws and regulations are subject to frequent changes. Therefore, we are unable to predict with certainty the future costs or other future impact of these laws on our operations and our customers. We could also incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines, civil or criminal sanctions and third party claims for property damage or personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations. In addition, there can be no assurance that we can avoid significant costs, liabilities and penalties imposed on us as a result of government regulation in the future.. Growth through acquisitions and investment could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.. We routinely evaluate potential acquisitions of single vessels, vessel fleets and businesses, and we expect to continue to enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. The process of integrating an acquisition could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiversion of management time and focus away from operating our business to integrating the business;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tintegration of the acquired company’s accounting, human resources and other administrative systems and the coordination of various business functions;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timplementation of, and changes to, controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttransition of customers into our operations;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tin the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries or regions;. 32. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties.. Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions or investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business in general.. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt or contingent liabilities, an increase in amortization expenses or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition.. We can give no assurance that we will be able to identify desirable acquisition candidates or that we will have the financial resources necessary to pursue desirable acquisition candidates or be successful in entering into definitive agreements or closing any such acquisition on satisfactory terms. An inability to acquire additional vessels or businesses may limit our growth potential.. We may be unable to attract and retain qualified, skilled employees necessary to operate our business.. Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. Our inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could impair our ability to manage, maintain and grow our business. In crewing our vessels, we require skilled employees who can perform physically demanding work, often in harsh or challenging environments for extended periods of time. As a result of the volatility of the oil and gas industry and the demanding nature of the work, potential vessel employees may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive with ours. Further, we face strong competition within the broader oilfield industry for potential employees, including competition from drilling rig operators, for our fleet personnel. It is possible that we will have to raise wage rates to attract workers and to retain our current employees. If we are not able to increase our charges to our customers to compensate for wage increases, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If we are unable to recruit qualified personnel we may not be able to operate our vessels at full utilization, which would adversely affect our results of operations.. We may incur additional asset impairments as a result of reduced demand for certain vessels.. The current oversupply of vessels in offshore oil and gas exploration and production markets has resulted in numerous vessels being idled or stacked and, in some cases, retired or scrapped. We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Impairment write-offs could result if, for example, any of our vessels become obsolete or commercially less desirable or their carrying values become excessive due to the condition of the vessel, stacking the vessel, the expectation of stacking the vessel in the near future, a decision to retire or scrap the vessel, changes in technology, market demand or market expectations, or excess spending over budget on a new-build vessel. Asset impairment evaluations are, by their nature, highly subjective. The use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets, which could impact the need to record an impairment charge and the amount of any charge taken. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Intangibles” in Part II, Item 7 and Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.. We can provide no assurance that our assumptions and estimates used in our asset impairment evaluations will ultimately be realized or that the current carrying value of our property and equipment will ultimately be realized.. Our actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy may not be comparable to our historical financial information as a result of the implementation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby and our adoption of Fresh Start Accounting.. We emerged from bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on November 14, 2017. Upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted Fresh Start Accounting, as a consequence of which our assets and liabilities were adjusted to fair values and our accumulated deficit was restated to zero. Accordingly, our future financial condition and results of operations may not be comparable to the financial condition or results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements. The lack of comparable historical financial information may discourage investors from purchasing our securities. In addition, in conjunction with our emergence from bankruptcy and our adoption of Fresh Start Accounting, we adopted new accounting policies relating to drydocks and useful lives and estimated salvage values of our vessels. Prior to emergence, we expensed regulatory drydocks as they were incurred. With Fresh Start Accounting, we will capitalize the cost of regulatory drydocks and amortize such cost over 30 months, the regulatory interval between required drydocks. Prior to emergence, we depreciated the cost of each vessel over a useful life of 25 years to an estimated salvage value of 15% of original cost. Under Fresh Start Accounting, we reduced our useful life estimate of each vessel to 20 years and our salvage value estimate to 5%.. 33. We currently have no plans to pay cash dividends or other distributions on our Common Stock.. We currently do not expect to pay any cash dividends or other distributions on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay cash dividends or other distributions on our Common Stock will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and, if we elect to pay such dividends in the future, we may reduce or discontinue entirely the payment of such dividends at any time. The Board of Directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and operating results, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, agreements governing any existing and future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries may incur and other contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders, and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant.. Climate change, climate change regulations and greenhouse gas effects may adversely impact our operations and markets.. There is a concern that emissions of greenhouse gases, or GHGs, such as carbon dioxide and methane, alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that affect the global climate. Climate change, including the impact of global warming, may create physical and financial risk for organizations whose operations are affected by the climate. Some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Financial risks relating to climate change are likely to arise from increasing regulation of GHG emissions, as compliance with any new rules could be difficult and costly. For example, from time to time legislation has been proposed in the U.S. Congress to reduce GHG emissions. In addition, in the absence of federal GHG legislation, the EPA has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions. Depending on the outcome of these or other regulatory initiatives, increased energy, environmental and other costs and capital expenditures could be necessary to comply with the relevant limitations. Our vessels also operate in foreign jurisdictions that are addressing climate changes by legislation or regulation. Unless and until legislation or regulations are enacted and their terms are finalized, we cannot reasonably or reliably estimate its impact on our financial condition, operating performance or ability to compete. In addition, any GHG related legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and gas produced by our customers. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations."
