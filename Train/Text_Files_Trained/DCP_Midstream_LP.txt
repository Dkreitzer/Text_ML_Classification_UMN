[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. Limited partner interests are inherently different from capital stock of a corporation, although many of the business risks to which we are subject are similar to those that would be faced by a corporation engaged in similar businesses. You should consider carefully the following risk factors together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating an investment in our common units.. If any of the following risks were actually to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially affected. In that case, we might not be able to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on our common units, the trading price of our common units could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.. Risks Related to Our Business. Our cash flow is affected by natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices.. Our business is affected by natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices. In the past, the prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil have been volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue.. The level of drilling activity is dependent on economic and business factors beyond our control. Among the factors that impact drilling decisions are commodity prices, the liquids content of the natural gas production, drilling requirements for producers to hold leases, the cost of finding and producing natural gas and crude oil and the general condition of the financial markets. Commodity prices experienced significant volatility during 2017, as illustrated by the following table:. Year Ended December 31, 2017   December 31, 2017     Daily High   Daily Low   Commodity:             NYMEX Natural Gas ($/MMBtu)   $ 3.42     $ 2.56     $ 2.95   NGLs ($/Gallon)   $ 0.76     $ 0.50     $ 0.76   Crude Oil ($/Bbl)   $ 60.42     $ 42.53     $ 60.42. 19. During periods of natural gas price decline and/or if the price of NGLs and crude oil declines, the level of drilling activity could decrease further. When combined with a reduction of cash flow resulting from lower commodity prices, a reduction in our producers' borrowing base under reserve-based credit facilities and lack of availability of debt or equity financing for our producers may result in a significant reduction in our producers' spending for crude oil and natural gas drilling activity, which could result in lower volumes being transported on our pipeline systems. Other factors that impact production decisions include the ability of producers to obtain necessary drilling and other governmental permits and regulatory changes. Because of these factors, even if new natural gas reserves are discovered in areas served by our assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. If we are not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas to replace the declines resulting from reductions in drilling activity, throughput on our pipelines and the utilization rates of our treating and processing facilities would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows and our ability to make cash distributions.. Market conditions, including commodity prices, may impact our earnings, financial condition and cash flows.. The markets and prices for natural gas, NGLs, condensate and crude oil depend upon factors beyond our control and may not always have a close relationship. These factors include supply of and demand for these commodities, which fluctuate with changes in domestic and export markets and economic conditions and other factors, including:. • the level of domestic and offshore production;. • the availability of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil and the demand in the U.S. and globally for these commodities;. • a general downturn in economic conditions;. • the impact of weather, including abnormally mild winter or summer weather that cause lower energy usage for heating or cooling purposes, respectively, or extreme weather that may disrupt our operations or related upstream or  downstream operations;. • actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing and importing nations;. • the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems and condensate and NGL export facilities;. • the availability and marketing of competitive fuels; and. • the extent of governmental regulation and taxation.. Our primary natural gas gathering and processing arrangements that expose us to commodity price risk are our percent-of-proceeds arrangements. Under percent-of-proceeds arrangements, we generally purchase natural gas from producers for an agreed percentage of the proceeds from the sale of residue gas and/or NGLs resulting from our processing activities, and then sell the resulting residue gas and NGLs at market prices. Under these types of arrangements, our revenues and our cash flows increase or decrease, whichever is applicable, as the price of natural gas and NGLs fluctuate.. Our NGL pipelines could be adversely affected by any decrease in NGL prices relative to the price of natural gas.. The profitability of our NGL pipelines is dependent on the level of production of NGLs from processing plants. When natural gas prices are high relative to NGL prices, it is less profitable to process natural gas because of the higher value of natural gas compared to the value of NGLs and because of the increased cost (principally that of natural gas as a feedstock and fuel) of separating the NGLs from the natural gas. As a result, we may experience periods in which higher natural gas prices relative to NGL prices reduce the volume of natural gas processed at plants connected to our NGL pipelines, as well as reducing the amount of NGL extraction, which would reduce the volumes and gross margins attributable to our NGL pipelines and NGL storage facilities.. Our hedging activities and the application of fair value measurements may have a material adverse effect on our earnings, profitability, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.. We are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in commodity prices. The extent of our commodity price risk is related largely to the effectiveness and scope of our hedging activities. For example, the derivative instruments we utilize are based on posted market prices, which may differ significantly from the actual natural gas, NGL and condensate prices that we realize in our operations. To mitigate a portion of our cash flow exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas and NGLs, we have entered into derivative financial instruments relating to the future price of natural gas and NGLs, as well as crude oil. Furthermore, we have entered into derivative transactions related to only a portion of the volume of our expected natural gas supply and production of NGLs and condensate from our processing plants; as a result, we will continue to have direct commodity price risk to the portion not covered by derivative transactions. Our actual future production may be significantly higher or lower than we estimate at the time we entered into the derivative transactions for that period. If the actual amount is higher than we estimate, we will have greater commodity price risk than we intended. If the actual amount is lower than the amount that is subject to our derivative financial instruments, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative transactions without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity, reducing our liquidity.. 20. We record all of our derivative financial instruments at fair value on our balance sheet primarily using information readily observable within the marketplace. In situations where market observable information is not available, we may use a variety of data points that are market observable, or in certain instances, develop our own expectation of fair value. We will continue to use market observable information as the basis for our fair value calculations; however, there is no assurance that such information will continue to be available in the future. In such instances, we may be required to exercise a higher level of judgment in developing our own expectation of fair value, which may be significantly different from the historical fair values, and may increase the volatility of our earnings.. We will continue to evaluate whether to enter into any new derivative arrangements, but there can be no assurance that we will enter into any new derivative arrangement or that our future derivative arrangements will be on terms similar to our existing derivative arrangements. Additionally, although we enter into derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of our commodity price and interest rate risk, we also forego the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor.. Our derivative instruments may require us to post collateral based on predetermined collateral thresholds. Depending on the movement in commodity prices, the amount of posted collateral required may increase, reducing our liquidity.. Our hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend and may actually increase the volatility of our earnings and cash flows. In addition, even though our management monitors our hedging activities, these activities can result in material losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not or is unable to perform its obligations under the applicable derivative arrangement, the derivative arrangement is imperfect or ineffective, or our risk management policies and procedures are not properly followed or do not work as planned.. We could incur losses due to impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or long-lived assets.. We periodically evaluate goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment. Our impairment analyses for long-lived assets require management to apply judgment in evaluating whether events and circumstances are present that indicate an impairment may have occurred. If we believe an impairment may have occurred judgments are then applied in estimating future cash flows as well as asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets, assessing the probability of different outcomes, and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. To perform the impairment assessment for goodwill, we primarily use a discounted cash flow analysis, supplemented by a market approach analysis. Key assumptions in the analysis include the use of an appropriate discount rate, terminal year multiples, and estimated future cash flows including an estimate of operating and general and administrative costs. In estimating cash flows, we incorporate current market information (including forecasted volumes and commodity prices), as well as historical and other factors. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to impairment charges. Adverse changes in our business or the overall operating environment, such as lower commodity prices, may affect our estimate of future operating results, which could result in future impairment due to the potential impact on our operations and cash flows.. A reduction in demand for NGL products by the petrochemical, refining or other industries or by the fuel markets could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.. The NGL products we produce have a variety of applications, including as heating fuels, petrochemical feedstocks and refining blend stocks. A reduction in demand for NGL products, whether because of general or industry specific economic conditions, new government regulations, global competition, reduced demand by consumers for products made with NGL products (for example, reduced petrochemical demand observed due to lower activity in the automobile and construction industries), increased competition from petroleum-based feedstocks due to pricing differences, mild winter weather for some NGL applications or other reasons, could result in a decline in the volume of NGL products we handle or reduce the fees we charge for our services.. Volumes of natural gas dedicated to our systems in the future may be less than we anticipate.. If the reserves connected to our gathering systems are less than we anticipate and we are unable to secure additional sources of natural gas, then the volumes of natural gas on our systems in the future could be less than we anticipate.. 21. We depend on certain natural gas producer customers for a significant portion of our supply of natural gas and NGLs.. We identify as primary natural gas suppliers those suppliers individually representing 10% or more of our total natural gas and NGLs supply. We have no natural gas supplier representing 10% or more of our total natural gas supply during the year ended December 31, 2017. While some of these customers are subject to long-term contracts, we may be unable to negotiate extensions or replacements of these contracts on favorable terms, if at all. The loss of all or even a portion of the natural gas and NGL volumes supplied by these customers, as a result of competition or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business.. Because of the natural decline in production from existing wells, our success depends on our ability to obtain new sources of supplies of natural gas and NGLs.. Our gathering and transportation pipeline systems are connected to or dependent on the level of production from natural gas and crude wells, from which production will naturally decline over time. As a result, our cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time. In order to maintain or increase throughput levels on our gathering and transportation pipeline systems and NGL pipelines and the asset utilization rates at our natural gas processing plants, we must continually obtain new supplies. The primary factors affecting our ability to obtain new supplies of natural gas and NGLs, and to attract new customers to our assets include the level of successful drilling activity near these assets, the demand for natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, producers' desire and ability to obtain necessary permits in an efficient manner, natural gas field characteristics and production performance, surface access and infrastructure issues, and our ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells. If we are not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells or because of competition, throughput on our pipelines and the utilization rates of our treating and processing facilities would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows, and our ability to make cash distributions.. Third party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our natural gas and NGL pipelines and facilities may become unavailable to transport, process or produce natural gas and NGLs.. We depend upon third party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our pipelines and facilities for the benefit of our customers. Since we do not own or operate any of these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control and may become unavailable to transport, process or produce natural gas and NGLs.. We may not successfully balance our purchases and sales of natural gas and propane.. We purchase from producers and other customers a substantial amount of the natural gas that flows through our natural gas gathering, processing and transportation systems for resale to third parties, including natural gas marketers and end-users. In addition, in our wholesale propane logistics business, we purchase propane from a variety of sources and resell the propane to distributors. We may not be successful in balancing our purchases and sales. A producer or supplier could fail to deliver contracted volumes or deliver in excess of contracted volumes, or a purchaser could purchase less than contracted volumes. Any of these actions could cause our purchases and sales to be unbalanced. While we attempt to balance our purchases and sales, if our purchases and sales are unbalanced, we will face increased exposure to commodity price risks and could have increased volatility in our operating income and cash flows.. Our ability to manage and grow our business effectively could be adversely affected if we or DCP Midstream, LLC and its subsidiaries fail to attract and retain key management personnel and skilled employees.. We rely on our executive management team to manage our day-to-day affairs and establish and execute our strategic business and operational plans. This executive management team has significant experience in the midstream energy industry. The loss of any of our executives or the failure to fill new positions created by expansion, turnover or retirement could adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy. In addition, our operations require engineers, operational and field technicians and other highly skilled employees. Competition for experienced executives and skilled employees is intense and increases when the demand from other energy companies for such personnel is high. Our ability to execute on our business strategy and to grow or continue our level of service to our current customers may be impaired and our business may be adversely impacted if we or DCP Midstream, LLC and its subsidiaries are unable to attract, train and retain such personnel, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.. 22. A downgrade of our credit rating could impact our liquidity, access to capital and our costs of doing business, and independent third parties determine our credit ratings outside of our control.. In January 2017, our credit rating was lowered and the cost of borrowing under our Credit Agreement increased. The further lowering of our credit rating could further increase our cost of borrowing under our Credit Agreement and could require us to post collateral with third parties, including our hedging arrangements, which could negatively impact our available liquidity and increase our cost of debt.. Credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. The analysis includes a number of criteria including, but not limited to, business composition, market and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. Credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities, although such credit ratings may affect the market value of our debt instruments. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies.. Our debt levels may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.. We continue to have the ability to incur additional debt, subject to limitations within our Credit Agreement. Our level of debt could have important consequences to us, including the following:. • our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;. • an increased amount of cash flow will be required to make interest payments on our debt;. • our debt level will make us more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and. • our debt level may limit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.. Our ability to obtain new debt funding or service our existing debt will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors. In addition, our ability to service debt under our Credit Agreement will depend on market interest rates. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we may take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt, or seeking additional equity capital. We may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms, or at all.. Restrictions in our Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our notes may limit our ability to make distributions to unitholders and may limit our ability to capitalize on acquisitions and other business opportunities.. Our Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our notes contain covenants limiting our ability to make distributions, incur indebtedness, grant liens, make acquisitions, investments or dispositions and engage in transactions with affiliates. Furthermore, our Credit Agreement contains covenants requiring us to maintain a certain leverage ratio and certain other tests. Any subsequent replacement of our Credit Agreement or any new indebtedness could have similar or greater restrictions. If our covenants are not met, whether as a result of reduced production levels of natural gas and NGLs as described above or otherwise, our financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions to our unitholders could be materially adversely affected.. Changes in interest rates may adversely impact our ability to issue additional equity or incur debt, as well as the ability of exploration and production companies to finance new drilling programs around our systems.. Interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase. As with other yield-oriented securities, our unit price is impacted by the level of our cash distributions and implied distribution yield. The distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank related yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our units, and a rising interest rate environment could impair our ability to issue additional equity or incur debt to make acquisitions, for other purposes. Increased interest costs could also inhibit the financing of new capital drilling programs by exploration and production companies served by our systems.. 23. The outstanding senior notes and junior subordinated notes, or notes, are unsecured obligations of our operating subsidiary, DCP Midstream Operating, LP, or DCP Operating, and are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. As a result, our notes are effectively junior to DCP Operating's existing and future secured debt and to all debt and other liabilities of its subsidiaries.. The 2.70% Senior Notes due 2019, 9.75% Senior Notes due 2019, 5.35% Senior Notes due 2020, 4.75% Senior Notes due 2021, 4.95% Senior Notes due 2022, 3.875% Senior Notes due 2023, 8.125% Senior Notes due 2030, 6.450% Senior Notes due 2036, 6.750% Senior Notes due 2037, and 5.60% Senior Notes due 2044, or the Senior Notes, are senior unsecured obligations of DCP Operating and rank equally in right of payment with all of its other existing and future senior unsecured debt and effectively junior to any of its future secured indebtedness to the extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The 5.85% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Notes due 2043 are junior subordinated obligations of DCP Operating and rank junior in right of payment with all of its other existing and future senior unsecured debt. All of our operating assets are owned by our subsidiaries, and none of these subsidiaries guarantee DCP Operating's obligations with respect to the notes. Creditors of DCP Operating's subsidiaries may have claims with respect to the assets of those subsidiaries that rank effectively senior to the notes. In the event of any distribution or payment of assets of such subsidiaries in any dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganization or bankruptcy proceeding, the claims of those creditors would be satisfied prior to making any such distribution or payment to DCP Operating in respect of its direct or indirect equity interests in such subsidiaries. Consequently, after satisfaction of the claims of such creditors, there may be little or no amounts left available to make payments in respect of our notes. As of December 31, 2017, DCP Operating's subsidiaries had no debt for borrowed money owing to any unaffiliated third parties. However, such subsidiaries are not prohibited under the indentures governing the notes from incurring indebtedness in the future.. In addition, because our notes and our guarantees of our notes are unsecured, holders of any secured indebtedness of us would have claims with respect to the assets constituting collateral for such indebtedness that are senior to the claims of the holders of our notes. Currently, we do not have any secured indebtedness. Although the indentures governing our notes places some limitations on our ability to create liens securing debt, there are significant exceptions to these limitations that will allow us to secure significant amounts of indebtedness without equally and ratably securing the notes. If we incur secured indebtedness and such indebtedness is either accelerated or becomes subject to a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our assets would be used to satisfy obligations with respect to the indebtedness secured thereby before any payment could be made on our notes. Consequently, any such secured indebtedness would effectively be senior to our notes and our guarantee of our notes, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the secured indebtedness. In that event, our noteholders may not be able to recover all the principal or interest due under our notes.. Our significant indebtedness and the restrictions in our debt agreements may adversely affect our future financial and operating flexibility.. As of December 31, 2017, our consolidated principal indebtedness was $4,725 million. Our significant indebtedness and the additional debt we may incur in the future for potential acquisitions may adversely affect our liquidity and therefore our ability to make interest payments on our notes and distributions on our units.. Debt service obligations and restrictive covenants in our Credit Agreement, and the indentures governing our notes may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations, pursue acquisitions and fund other capital needs as well as our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. In addition, this leverage may make our results of operations more susceptible to adverse economic or operating conditions by limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and may place us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors that have less debt.. If we incur any additional indebtedness, including trade payables, that ranks equally with our notes, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of our notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of us or DCP Operating. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to our noteholders. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.. The adoption of financial reform legislation by the United States Congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to hedge risks associated with our business.. We hedge a portion of our commodity risk and our interest rate risk. In its rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Act, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, adopted regulations. 24. to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents, but these rules were successfully challenged in Federal district court by the Securities Industry Financial Markets Association and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and largely vacated by the court. In December 2016, the CFTC reproposed rules that place limits on speculative positions in certain physical commodity futures and options contracts and their \"economically equivalent\" swaps, including NYMEX Henry Hub Natural Gas and NYMEX Light Sweet Crude Oil contracts, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. The CFTC has sought comment on the position limits rules as reproposed, but since these rules are not yet final, the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time. Under the reproposed rules, we believe our hedging transactions will qualify for the non-financial, commercial end user exception, which exempts derivatives intended to hedge or mitigate commercial risk from the mandatory swap clearing requirement, and as a result, we do not expect our hedging activity to be subject to mandatory clearing. The Act may also require us to comply with margin requirements in connection with our hedging activities, although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time. The Act may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their hedging activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty. The new legislation and related regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivatives contracts for our industry (including requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivatives contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivatives contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties, particularly if we are unable to utilize the commercial end user exception with respect to certain of our hedging transactions. If we reduce our use of hedging as a result of the legislation and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures and fund unitholder distributions. Finally, the legislation was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition, and our results of operations.. Future disruptions in the global credit markets may make equity and debt markets less accessible and capital markets more costly, create a shortage in the availability of credit and lead to credit market volatility, which could disrupt our financing plans and limit our ability to grow.. From time to time, public equity markets experience significant declines, and global credit markets experience a shortage in overall liquidity and a resulting disruption in the availability of credit. Future disruptions in the global financial marketplace, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of financial institutions, could make equity and debt markets inaccessible, and adversely affect the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future. We have availability under our Credit Agreement to borrow additional capital, but our ability to borrow under that facility could be impaired if one or more of our lenders fails to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us.. As a publicly traded partnership, these developments could significantly impair our ability to make acquisitions or finance growth projects. We distribute all of our available cash, as defined in our Partnership Agreement (\"Partnership Agreement\"), to our common unitholders on a quarterly basis. We rely upon external financing sources, including the issuance of debt and equity securities and bank borrowings, to fund acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures or fund routine periodic working capital needs. Any limitations on our access to external capital, including limitations caused by illiquidity or volatility in the capital markets, may impair our ability to complete future acquisitions and construction projects on favorable terms, if at all. As a result, we may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to businesses that reinvest all of their available cash to expand ongoing operations, particularly under adverse economic conditions.. Volatility in the capital markets may adversely impact our liquidity.. The capital markets may experience volatility, which may lead to financial uncertainty. Our access to funds under the Credit Agreement is dependent on the ability of the lenders that are party to the Credit Agreement to meet their funding obligations. Those lenders may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity. If lenders under the Credit Agreement were to fail to fund their share of the Credit Agreement, our available borrowings could be further reduced. In addition, our borrowing capacity may be further limited by the Credit Agreement's financial covenants.. A significant downturn in the economy could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In the event that our results were negatively impacted, we could require additional borrowings. A deterioration of the capital markets could adversely affect our ability to access funds on reasonable terms in a timely manner.. 25. We have a holding company structure in which our subsidiaries conduct our operations and own our operating assets.. The partnership is a holding company, and our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own all of our operating assets. We do not have significant assets other than equity in our subsidiaries and equity investees. As a result, our ability to make required payments on our notes depends on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to us. The ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us may be restricted by, among other things, credit instruments, applicable state business organization laws and other laws and regulations. If our subsidiaries are prevented from distributing funds to us, we may be unable to pay all the principal and interest on the notes when due.. We may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from implementing and administering pipeline and asset integrity programs and related repairs.. Pursuant to the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, PHMSA has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for transportation pipelines located where a leak or rupture could do the most harm in \"high consequence areas.\" The regulations require operators to:. • perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;. • identify threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area and assess the risks that such threats pose to pipeline integrity;. • collect, integrate, and analyze data regarding threats and risks posed to the pipeline;. • repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary; and. • implement preventive and mitigating actions.. Pipeline safety legislation enacted in 2012, the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011, or the Pipeline Safety and Job Creations Act, reauthorizes funding for federal pipeline safety programs through 2015, increases penalties for safety violations, establishes additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines, and requires studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines, including the expansion of integrity management, use of automatic and remote-controlled shut-off valves, leak detection systems, sufficiency of existing regulation of gathering pipelines, use of excess flow valves, verification of maximum allowable operating pressure, incident notification, and other pipeline-safety related requirements. New rules proposed by PHMSA, address many areas of this legislation. Extending the integrity management requirements to our gathering lines would impose additional obligations on us and could add material cost to our operations.. Although many of our natural gas facilities currently are not subject to pipeline integrity requirements, we may incur significant costs and liabilities associated with repair, remediation, preventative or mitigation measures associated with non-exempt pipelines. Such costs and liabilities might relate to repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program, or new requirements that may be imposed as a result of the Pipeline Safety and Job Creation Act, as well as lost cash flows resulting from shutting down our pipelines during the pendency of such repairs. Additionally, we may be affected by the testing, maintenance and repair of pipeline facilities downstream from our own facilities. With the exception of our Wattenberg pipeline, our NGL pipelines are also subject to integrity management and other safety regulations imposed by the Texas Railroad Commission, or TRRC.. We currently estimate that we will incur approximately $47 million between 2018 and 2022 to implement pipeline integrity management program testing along certain segments of our natural gas and NGL pipelines. This does not include the costs, if any, of any repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program, or new requirements that may be imposed as a result of the Pipeline Safety and Job Creation Act, which costs could be substantial.. We currently transport NGLs produced at our processing plants on our owned and third party NGL pipelines. Accordingly, in the event that an owned or third party NGL pipeline becomes inoperable due to any necessary repairs resulting from integrity testing programs or for any other reason for any significant period of time, we would need to transport NGLs by other means. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into alternative transportation arrangements under comparable terms.. Any new or expanded pipeline integrity requirements or the adoption of other asset integrity requirements could also increase our cost of operation and impair our ability to provide service during the period in which assessments and repairs take place, adversely affecting our business. Further, execution of and compliance with such integrity programs may cause us to. 26. incur greater than expected capital and operating expenditures for repairs and upgrades that are necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our assets.. State and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to oil and gas operations could adversely affect our third-party customers' production and, therefore, adversely impact our midstream operations.. Certain states in which we operate have adopted or are considering adopting measures that could impose new or more stringent requirements on oil and gas exploration and production activities. For example, the potential for adverse impacts to our business is present where local governments have enacted ordinances directly regulating pipeline assets and operations, and and private individuals have sponsored citizen initiatives to limit hydraulic fracturing, increase mandatory setbacks of oil and gas operations from occupied structures, and achieve more restrictive state or local control over such activities.. In the event state or local restrictions or prohibitions are adopted in our areas of operations, our customers may incur significant compliance costs or may experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of their exploration, development, or production activities, and possibly be limited or precluded in the drilling of certain wells altogether. Any adverse impact on our customers' activities would have a corresponding negative impact on our throughput volumes. In addition, while the general focus of debate is on upstream development activities, certain proposals may, if adopted, directly impact our ability to competitively locate, construct, maintain, and operate our own assets. Accordingly, such restrictions or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our unitholders.. We may incur significant costs and liabilities in the future resulting from a failure to comply with existing or new environmental regulations or an accidental release of hazardous substances or hydrocarbons into the environment.. Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These include, for example, (1) the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations, including federal and state air permits, that impose obligations related to air emissions; (2) the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or RCRA, and comparable state laws that impose requirements for the management, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste from our facilities; (3) the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, also known as \"Superfund,\" and comparable state laws that regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or locations to which we have sent waste for disposal; (4) the Clean Water Act and the Oil Pollution Act, and comparable state laws that impose requirements on discharges to waters as well as requirements to prevent and respond to releases of hydrocarbons to waters of the United States and regulated state waters; and (5) state laws that impose requirements on the response to and remediation of hydrocarbon releases to soil and managing related wastes. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or newly adopted laws or regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and potentially criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements, and the issuance of orders enjoining or affecting future operations. Certain environmental regulations, including CERCLA and analogous state laws and regulations, impose strict liability and joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances, and in some cases hydrocarbons, have been disposed or otherwise released.. There is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in our business due to our handling of natural gas, NGLs and other petroleum products, air emissions related to our operations, and historical industry operations and waste management and disposal practices. For example, an accidental release from one of our facilities could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage, governmental claims for natural resource damages or imposing fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws, permits or regulations. In addition, it is possible that stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase our compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance or third-party indemnification.. A change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets.. The majority of our natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation operations are exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA but FERC regulation still affects these businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses. FERC's policies and practices across the range of its oil and natural gas regulatory activities, including, for example, its policies on open access transportation, ratemaking, capacity release and market center promotion, indirectly affect intrastate markets. In recent years, FERC has pursued pro-competitive policies in its regulation of interstate oil and natural gas pipelines. However, we cannot assure that FERC will continue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that. 27. may affect rights of access to oil and natural gas transportation capacity. In addition, the distinction between FERC-regulated transportation services and federally unregulated gathering services has been the subject of regular litigation, so the classification and regulation of some of our gathering facilities and intrastate transportation pipelines may be subject to change based on any reassessment by us of the jurisdictional status of our facilities or on future determinations by FERC and the courts.. In addition, the rates, terms and conditions of some of the transportation services we provide on certain of our pipeline systems are subject to FERC regulation under Section 311 of the NGPA. Under Section 311, rates charged for transportation must be fair and equitable, and amounts collected in excess of fair and equitable rates are subject to refund with interest.. Several of our pipelines are interstate transporters of NGLs and are subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act and the Elkins Act. The base interstate tariff rates for our NGL pipelines are determined either by a FERC cost-of-service proceeding or by agreement with an unaffiliated party, and adjusted annually through the FERC's indexing methodology. The NGL pipelines may also provide incentive rates, which offer tariff rates below the base tariff rates for high volume shipments.. Should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. Under EPACT 2005, FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA to impose penalties of up to $1 million per day for each violation and possible criminal penalties of up to $1 million per violation and five years in prison. Under the NGPA, FERC may impose civil penalties of up to $1 million for any one violation and may impose criminal penalties of up to $1 million and five years in prison.. Other state and local regulations also affect our business. Our non-proprietary gathering lines are subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes. Ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, oil or natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes restrict our right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to purchase or transport oil or natural gas. Federal law leaves any economic regulation of natural gas gathering to the states. The states in which we operate have adopted complaint-based regulation of oil and natural gas gathering activities, which allows oil and natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to oil and natural gas gathering access and rate discrimination. Other state regulations may not directly regulate our business, but may nonetheless affect the availability of natural gas for purchase, processing and sale, including state regulation of production rates and maximum daily production allowable from gas wells. While our proprietary gathering lines are currently subject to limited state regulation, there is a risk that state laws will be changed, which may give producers a stronger basis to challenge the proprietary status of a line, or the rates, terms and conditions of a gathering line providing transportation service.. The interstate tariff rates of certain of our pipelines are subject to review and possible adjustment by federal regulators.. FERC, pursuant to the NGA, regulates many aspects of our interstate natural gas pipeline transportation service, including the rates our pipelines are permitted to charge for such service. Under the NGA, interstate transportation rates must be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory. If FERC fails to permit our requested tariff rate increases, or if FERC lowers the tariff rates we are permitted to charge, on its own initiative, or as a result of challenges raised by customers or third parties, our tariff rates may be insufficient to recover the full cost of providing interstate transportation service. In certain circumstances, FERC also has the power to order refunds.. Should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and the disgorgement of profits. Under EPACT 2005, FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1 million per day for each violation and possible criminal penalties of up to $1 million per violation and five years in prison.. The transportation rates for our NGL pipelines that provide interstate transportation services, our interstate natural gas pipelines, and our intrastate pipelines that provide interstate services under Section 311 of the NGPA could be adversely impacted by potential changes to FERC's income tax allowance policy for partnership pipelines.. Under current policy, FERC permits pipelines to include, in the cost-of-service used as the basis for calculating the pipeline's regulated rates, a tax allowance reflecting the actual or potential income tax liability on public utility income attributable to all partnership or limited liability company interests, if the ultimate owner of the interest has an actual or potential income tax liability on such income. Under current policy, whether a pipeline's owners have such actual or potential income tax liability is reviewed by FERC on a case-by-case basis, and our pipelines' ability to recover an income tax allowance. 28. in a cost-of-service proceeding before FERC is subject to this review and potentially impacted by ultimate partnership ownership. On December 15, 2016, FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) regarding its income tax recovery policy following a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, issued in July 2016, that found FERC did not demonstrate there is no double recovery of income taxes for a partnership owned pipeline as a result of the income tax allowance and return on equity policies in a cost-of-service proceeding for an oil pipeline. While the Court of Appeals remand to FERC focused on a specific case, FERC's issuance of an NOI seeks comments on how to address any double-recovery of income taxes and also broader industry comments related to the impact on all regulated industries, including natural gas pipelines, oil pipelines and electric utilities. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding, but any shift in policy could impact future rate proceedings for our pipelines organized as partnerships and could adversely affect our revenues for our rates calculated using a cost-of-service methodology.. Moreover, in the NOI proceeding, parties have requested that FERC adjust the rates for interstate pipeline services based on the reduction in the federal income tax rates for corporations, as well as partners and other owners of pass-through entities, in the recently enacted Law to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018.  While we believe there is considerable regulatory precedent and laws that afford pipelines due process rights if their rates are contested, FERC has not yet responded to the motions and we cannot predict the outcome.  Any action by FERC could impact the rates for our regulated interstate pipeline services.  Additionally, the reduction in the federal income tax rates for corporations and individuals could impact the income tax allowance included in the cost-of-service calculations in future rate proceedings for our regulated interstate pipeline services.. Recently proposed or finalized rules imposing more stringent requirements on the oil and gas industry could cause our customers and us to incur increased capital expenditures and operating costs as well as reduce the demand for our services.. On August 16, 2012, the EPA issued final regulations under the Clean Air Act that, among other things, require additional emissions controls for natural gas and natural gas liquids production, including New Source Performance Standards, or NSPS, to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with such production activities. The final regulations require, among other things, the reduction of VOC emissions from existing natural gas wells that are re-fractured, as well as newly-drilled and fractured wells through the use of reduced emission completions or \"green completions\" and well completion combustion devices, such as flaring, as of January 1, 2015. In addition, these rules establish specific requirements regarding emissions from compressors and controllers at natural gas gathering and boosting stations and processing plants together with emissions reduction requirements for dehydrators and storage tanks at natural gas processing plants, compressor stations and gathering and boosting stations. The rules further establish new requirements for detection and repair of VOC leaks exceeding 500 parts per million in concentration at new or modified natural gas processing plants. The EPA made certain revisions to the regulation from 2013 to 2015, and the regulation is also the subject of Petitions for Review before the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In addition, in June 2016, the EPA expanded the NSPS regulations for new or modified sources of VOCs to include methane emissions.  Among other things, this regulation imposes leak detection and repair requirements for VOCs and methane on producer well site equipment and on midstream equipment such as compressor and booster stations, impose additional emission reduction requirements on specific pieces of oil and gas equipment, and is a regulatory pre-condition to EPA acting to regulate existing oil and gas methane sources in the future under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. This regulation is the subject of a Petition for Review before the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. This regulation is also the subject of review pursuant to the March 28, 2017, Presidential Executive Order on Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth, which ordered the EPA Administrator to review this regulation for consistency with the Executive Order's policy to review existing regulations impacting natural gas development and, if appropriate, \"suspend, revise, or rescind the guidance or publish for notice and comment proposed rules suspending, revising or rescinding those rules.\"  In response to the Executive Order, in June 2017, EPA published a proposed rule to stay the compliance requirements of the regulation while it reviews the rule.  The EPA separately withdrew the information request that it had issued in November 2016 as part of an effort to develop standards for methane and other emissions from existing sources in the oil and natural gas industry.  The EPA, in October 2015, revised and lowered the ambient air quality standard for ozone in the U.S. under the Clean Air Act, from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion, which is likely to result in more, and expanded, ozone non-attainment areas, which in turn will require states to adopt implementation plans to reduce emissions of ozone-forming pollutants, like VOCs and nitrogen oxides, that are emitted from, among others, the oil and gas industry. Persistent non-attainment status, such as for ozone, can result in lower major source permitting thresholds (making it more costly and complex to site and permit major new or modified facilities) and additional control requirements. In October 2016, the EPA also finalized Control Techniques Guidelines for VOC emissions from existing oil and natural gas equipment and processes in moderate ozone non-attainment areas. These Control Techniques Guidelines provide recommendations for states and local air agencies to consider when determining what emissions control requirements apply to sources in the non-attainment areas. In late 2017, however, EPA indicated that it will request comments on withdrawing the guidelines in their entirety.  Collectively, these regulations. 29. could require modifications to the operations of our exploration and production customers, as well as our operations, including the installation of new equipment and new emissions management practices, which could result in significant additional costs, both increased capital expenditures and operating costs. The incurrence of such expenditures and costs by our customers could also result in reduced production by those customers and thus translate into reduced demand for our services, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our business and cash available for distributions.. We may incur significant costs in the future associated with proposed climate change regulation and legislation.. The United States Congress and some states where we have operations may consider legislation related to greenhouse gas emissions, including methane emissions, which may compel reductions of such emissions. In addition, there have been international conventions and efforts to establish standards for the reduction of greenhouse gases globally, including the Paris accords in December 2015. The conditions for entry into force of the Paris accords were met on October 5, 2016 and the Agreement went into force 30 days later on November 4, 2016. In August 2017, however, the U.S. notified the United Nations Secretary-General that it intends to withdraw from the agreement as soon as it is able to do so, or November 2019.  Legislative proposals have included or could include limitations, or caps, on the amount of greenhouse gas that can be emitted, as well as a system of emissions allowances. For example, legislation passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010, which was not taken up by the Senate, would have placed the entire burden of obtaining allowances for the carbon content of NGLs on the owners of NGLs at the point of fractionation. In June 2013, President Obama announced a climate action plan that targets methane emissions from the oil and gas industry as part of a comprehensive interagency methane reduction strategy.  Many of the actions taken under the Obama Administration have been targeted by the Trump Administration.  For instance, in June 2017 EPA proposed a two-year stay of the compliance requirements for the new source performance standards for methane emissions (a greenhouse gas) from new and modified oil and gas industry sources that EPA has finalized in 2016. The EPA also indicated that it will request comments on entirely withdrawing the October 2016 Control Techniques Guidelines for emissions of VOCs from existing oil and gas industry sources in ozone nonattainment areas, which had an expected co-benefit of reduced methane emissions.  Relatedly, the D.C. Circuit Court challenge to the October 2015 EPA regulation reducing the ambient ozone standard from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion under the Clean Air Act was put in abeyance while the EPA reviews the regulation. Separately, the EPA in 2011 issued permitting rules for sources of greenhouse gases; however, in June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision upholding these rules and struck down the EPA's greenhouse gas permitting rules to the extent they impose a requirement to obtain a permit based solely on emissions of greenhouse gases. Under the Court ruling and the EPA's subsequent proposed rules, major sources of other air pollutants, such as VOCs or nitrogen oxides, could still be required to implement process or technology controls and obtain permits regarding emissions of greenhouse gases. These proposed rules have not been finalized.  The EPA has issued rules requiring reporting of greenhouse gas, on an annual basis, for certain onshore natural gas and oil production facilities, and in October 2015, the EPA amended and expanded those greenhouse gas reporting requirements to all segments of the oil and gas industry effective January 1, 2016. To the extent legislation is enacted or additional regulations are promulgated that regulate greenhouse gas emissions, it could significantly increase our costs to (i) acquire allowances; (ii) permit new large facilities; (iii) operate and maintain our facilities; (iv) install new emission controls or institute emission reduction measures; and (v) manage a greenhouse gas emissions program. If such legislation becomes law or additional rules are promulgated in the United States or any states in which we have operations and we are unable to pass these costs through as part of our services, it could have an adverse effect on our business and cash available for distributions.. Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions, delays or increased costs in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells, which could adversely impact our revenues by decreasing the volumes of natural gas that we gather, process and transport.. Certain of our customers' natural gas is developed from formations requiring hydraulic fracturing as part of the completion process. Fracturing is a process where water, sand, and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate hydrocarbon production. While the underground injection of fluids is regulated by the EPA under the Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, fracturing is excluded from regulation unless the injection fluid is diesel fuel. The EPA has published an interpretive memorandum and permitting guidance related to regulation of fracturing fluids using this regulatory authority. The EPA has finalized various regulatory programs directed at hydraulic fracturing. For example, in June 2016, the EPA issued regulations under the federal Clean Water Act to further regulate wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and other natural gas production to publicly-owned treatment works. The EPA also expanded, as discussed herein, existing Clean Air Act new source performance standards for new and modified air emissions sources, and finalized Control Techniques Guidelines for existing sources in ozone non-attainment areas, to reduce emissions of methane or VOCs from oil and gas sources, including drilling and production processes. The adoption of new laws or regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting or regulating, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult for our customers to complete oil and natural gas wells in shale formations and increase their costs of compliance. In addition, the EPA has studied the potential adverse impact that each stage of hydraulic fracturing may have on the environment; the EPA released a final assessment report. 30. of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources in December 2016. Several states in which our customers operate have also adopted regulations requiring disclosure of fracturing fluid components or otherwise regulate their use more closely. In Oklahoma, induced seismicity from injection of fluids in wastewater disposal wells has resulted in regulatory limitations on wastewater disposal into such wells. Under a recent settlement agreement, the EPA will decide by March 2019 whether to initiate rulemaking governing the disposal of wastewater from oil and gas development. The implementation of rules relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased expenditures for our exploration and production customers, which could cause them to reduce their production and thereby result in reduced demand for our services by these customers.. On March 28, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order 13783 entitled \"Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth.\" Executive Order 13783 directed executive departments and agencies to review regulations that potentially burden the development or use of domestically produced energy resources and, as appropriate, suspend, revise, or rescind those that unduly burden domestic energy resources development.  On March 26, 2015, the federal Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") finalized regulations requiring disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing activities upon Native American Indian and other federal lands, and added requirements on the use of hydraulic fracturing techniques and management of produced water on these lands.  The rule was never implemented due to court challenges.  On December 29, 2017, the BLM rescinded the rule.  On November 18, 2016, the BLM finalized regulations to, among other things, curtail the flaring during the production of natural gas and oil on Native American Indian and other federal lands, which affects how hydraulically fractured wells are developed and operated. The U.S. District Court denied a preliminary injunction sought by industry groups and the regulation went into effect on January 17, 2017; however, on December 8, 2017, the BLM finalized a rule suspending or delaying many of the provisions of the regulation while it reviews the regulation.  Our customers will continue to be subject to uncertainty associated with new regulatory suspensions, revisions, or rescissions and conflicting state and federal regulatory mandates, which could adversely affect their production and thereby result in reduced demand for our services by these customers.. Construction of new assets is subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal, economic, civil protest, and other risks that may adversely affect our financial results.. The construction of new midstream facilities or additions or modifications to our existing midstream asset systems or propane terminals involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political, legal, and economic uncertainties beyond our control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. For example, public participation in review and permitting processes can introduce uncertainty and additional costs associated with project timing and completion. Relatedly, civil protests regarding environmental and social issues, including construction of infrastructure associated with fossil fuels, may lead to increased legislative and regulatory initiatives and review at federal, state, and local levels of government that could prevent or delay the construction of such infrastructure and realization of associated revenues. Construction expenditures may occur over an extended period of time, yet we will not receive any material increases in cash flow until the project is completed and fully operational. Moreover, our cash flow from a project may be delayed or may not meet our expectations. These projects may not be completed on schedule or within budgeted cost, or at all. We may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize. Since we are not engaged in the exploration for and development of natural gas and oil reserves, we often do not have access to third party estimates of potential reserves in an area prior to constructing facilities in such area. To the extent we rely on estimates of future production in our decision to construct new systems or additions to our systems, such estimates may prove to be inaccurate because there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of future production. As a result, these facilities may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The construction of new systems or additions to our existing gathering, transportation and propane terminal assets may require us to obtain new rights-of-way prior to constructing these facilities. We may be unable to obtain such rights-of-way to connect new natural gas supplies to our existing gathering lines, expand our network of propane terminals, or capitalize on other attractive expansion opportunities. The construction of new systems or additions to our existing gathering, transportation and propane terminal assets may require us to rely on third parties downstream of our facilities to have available capacity for our delivered natural gas, NGLs, or propane. If such third party facilities are not constructed or operational at the time that the addition to our facilities is completed, we may experience adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition. The construction of additional systems may require greater capital investment if the commodity prices of certain supplies such as steel increase. Construction also subjects us to risks related to the ability to construct projects within anticipated costs, including the risk of cost overruns resulting from inflation or increased costs of equipment, materials, labor, or other factors beyond our control that could adversely affect results of operations, financial position or cash flows.. 31. We are exposed to the credit risks of our key producer customers and propane purchasers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our key producer customers or our propane purchasers could reduce our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.. We are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our producer customers and propane purchasers. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our key producer customers or our propane purchasers could reduce our ability to make distributions to our unitholders. Furthermore, some of our producer customers or our propane purchasers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which could increase the risk that they may default on their obligations to us. Additionally, a decline in the availability of credit to producers in and surrounding our geographic footprint could decrease the level of capital investment and growth that would otherwise bring new volumes to our existing assets and facilities.. If we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, our future growth could be limited.. Our ability to make acquisitions that are accretive to our cash generated from operations per unit is based upon our ability to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with them and obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms. Furthermore, even if we do make acquisitions that we believe will be accretive, these acquisitions may nevertheless result in a decrease in the cash generated from operations per unit. Additionally, net assets contributed by DCP Midstream, LLC represent a transfer of net assets between entities under common control, and are recognized at DCP Midstream, LLC's basis in the net assets transferred. The amount of the purchase price in excess of DCP Midstream, LLC's basis in the net assets, if any, is recognized as a reduction to partners' equity. Conversely, the amount of the purchase price less than DCP Midstream's basis in the net assets, if any, is recognized as an increase to partners' equity.. Any acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:. • mistaken assumptions about volumes, future contract terms with customers, revenues and costs, including synergies;. • an inability to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire;. • the assumption of unknown liabilities;. • limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;. • mistaken assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt;. • the diversion of management's and employees' attention from other business concerns;. • change in competitive landscape;. • unforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic areas; and. • customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses.. If we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources.. In addition, any limitations on our access to substantial new capital to finance strategic acquisitions will impair our ability to execute this component of our growth strategy. If the cost of such capital becomes too expensive, our ability to develop or acquire accretive assets will be limited. We may not be able to raise the necessary funds on satisfactory terms, if at all. The primary factors that influence our cost of capital include market conditions and offering or borrowing costs such as interest rates or underwriting discounts.. We may not be able to grow or effectively manage our growth.. Historically, a principal focus of our strategy was to continue to grow the per unit distribution on our units by expanding our business. The Transaction resulted in significant growth of the Partnership,  but also in the loss of certain future drop down opportunities from DCP Midstream, LLC. Our future growth will depend upon a number of factors, some of which we can control and some of which we cannot. These factors include our ability to:. • complete construction projects and consummate accretive acquisitions or joint ventures;. • identify businesses engaged in managing, operating or owning pipelines, processing and storage assets or other midstream assets for acquisitions, joint ventures and construction projects;. • appropriately identify liabilities associated with acquired businesses or assets;. • integrate acquired or constructed businesses or assets successfully with our existing operations and into our operating and financial systems and controls;. • hire, train and retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our growing business; and. • obtain required financing for our existing and new operations at reasonable rates.. 32. A deficiency in any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to sustain the level of our cash flows or realize benefits from acquisitions, joint ventures or construction projects. In addition, competition from other buyers could reduce our acquisition opportunities. DCP Midstream, LLC and its affiliates are not restricted from competing with us. DCP Midstream, LLC and its affiliates may acquire, construct or dispose of midstream or other assets in the future without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase or construct those assets. Furthermore, in recent years we have grown through organic projects, dropdowns and acquisitions. If we fail to properly integrate these assets successfully with our existing operations, if the future performance of these assets does not meet our expectations, if we did not properly value the assets, or we did not identify significant liabilities associated with acquired assets, the anticipated benefits from these transactions may not be fully realized.. Acquisitions may not be beneficial to us.. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:. • the failure to realize expected profitability, growth or accretion;. • an increase in indebtedness and borrowing costs;. • potential environmental or regulatory compliance matters or liabilities;. • potential title issues;. • the incurrence of unanticipated liabilities and costs; and. • the temporary diversion of management's attention from managing the remainder of our assets to the process of integrating the acquired businesses.. Assets recently acquired will also be subject to many of the same risks as our existing assets. If any of these risks or unanticipated liabilities or costs were to materialize, any desired benefits of these acquisitions may not be fully realized, if at all, and our future financial performance and results of operations could be negatively impacted.. Our assets and operations can be affected by weather, weather-related conditions and other natural phenomena.. Our assets and operations can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, wind, lightning, cold weather and other natural phenomena, which could impact our results of operations and make it more difficult for us to realize historic rates of return. Although we carry insurance on the vast majority of our assets, insurance may be inadequate to cover our loss and in some instances, we have been unable to obtain insurance on some of our assets on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we incur a significant disruption in our operations or a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, our financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions to our unitholders could be materially adversely affected.. We may not have sufficient cash from operations following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including cost reimbursements to our general partner, to enable us to continue to make cash distributions to our unitholders.. The amount of cash we can distribute on our units principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:. • the fees we charge and the margins we realize for our services;. • the prices of, level of production of, and demand for natural gas, condensate, NGLs and propane;. • the success of our commodity and interest rate hedging programs in mitigating fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates;. • the volume and quality of natural gas we gather, compress, treat, process, transport and sell, and the volume of NGLs we process, transport, sell and store, and the volume of propane we transport, sell and store;. • the operational performance and efficiency of our assets, including our plants and equipment;. • the operational performance and efficiency of third-party processing, fractionation or other facilities that provide services to us;. • the relationship between natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices;. • the level of competition from other energy companies;. • the impact of weather conditions on the demand for natural gas, NGLs and propane;. • the level of our operating and maintenance and general and administrative costs; and. • prevailing economic conditions.. In addition, the actual amount of cash we will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:. • the level of capital expenditures we make;. 33. • the cost and form of payment for acquisitions;. • our debt service requirements and other liabilities;. • fluctuations in our working capital needs;. • our ability to borrow funds and access capital markets at reasonable rates;. • restrictions contained in our Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our notes;. • the timing of our producers' obligations to make volume deficiency payments to us;. • the amount of cash distributions we receive from our equity interests;. • the amount of cost reimbursements to our general partner;. • the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner; and. • new, additions to and changes in laws and regulations.. We have partial ownership interests in various joint ventures, which could adversely affect our ability to operate and control these entities. In addition, we may be unable to control the amount of cash we will receive from the operation of these entities and we could be required to contribute significant cash to fund our share of their operations, which could adversely affect our ability to distribute cash to our unitholders.. Our inability, or limited ability, to control the operations and management of joint ventures in which we have a partial ownership interest may mean that we will not receive the amount of cash we expect to be distributed to us. In addition, for joint ventures in which we have a minority ownership interest, we will be unable to control ongoing operational decisions, including the incurrence of capital expenditures that we may be required to fund. Specifically,. • we have limited ability to control decisions with respect to the operations of these joint ventures, including decisions with respect to incurrence of expenses and distributions to us;. • these joint ventures may establish reserves for working capital, capital projects, environmental matters and legal proceedings which would otherwise reduce cash available for distribution to us;. • these joint ventures may incur additional indebtedness, and principal and interest made on such indebtedness may reduce cash otherwise available for distribution to us; and. • these joint ventures may require us to make additional capital contributions to fund working capital and capital expenditures, our funding of which could reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution.. All of these items could significantly and adversely impact our ability to distribute cash to our unitholders.. The amount of cash we have available for distribution to our unitholders depends primarily on our cash flow and not solely on profitability.. Profitability may be significantly affected by non-cash items. As a result, we may make cash distributions during periods when we record losses for financial accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when we record net earnings for financial accounting purposes.. We do not own all of the land on which our pipelines, facilities and rail terminals are located, which may subject us to increased costs.. Upon contract lease renewal, we may be subject to more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if we do not have valid rights of way or if such rights of way lapse or terminate. Certain of our leases contain renewal provisions that allow for our continued use and access of the subject land and, although we review and renew our leases as a routine business matter, there may be instances where we may not be able to renew our contract leases on commercially reasonable terms or may have to commence eminent domain proceedings to establish our right to continue to use the land. We obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines, surface sites and rail terminals on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time.. Our business involves many hazards and operational risks, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance.. Our operations, and the operations of third parties, are subject to many hazards inherent in the gathering, compressing, treating, processing, storing, transporting and fractionating, as applicable, of natural gas, propane and NGLs, including:. • damage to pipelines, plants, terminals, storage facilities and related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires and other natural disasters and acts of terrorism;. • inadvertent damage from construction, farm and utility equipment;. • leaks of natural gas, propane, NGLs and other hydrocarbons from our pipelines, plants, terminals, or storage facilities, or losses of natural gas, propane or NGLs as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities;. • contaminants in the pipeline system;. 34. • fires and explosions; and. • other hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and suspension of operations.. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage and may result in curtailment or suspension of our related operations. We are not fully insured against all risks inherent to our business, including offshore wind. Although we insure most of our underground pipeline systems against property damage, certain of our gathering pipelines are not covered. We are not insured against all environmental accidents that might occur, which may include toxic tort claims, other than those considered to be sudden and accidental. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage, or may become prohibitively expensive, and we may elect not to carry such a policy.. Our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, terrorist attacks, the threat of terrorist attacks, sustained military campaigns and related disruptions.. We face cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable. Cybersecurity threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. These events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability.. We face the threat of future terrorist attacks on both our industry in general and on us, including the possibility that infrastructure facilities could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. The increased security measures we have taken as a precaution against possible terrorist attacks have resulted in increased costs to our business. Any physical damage to facilities resulting from acts of terrorism may not be covered, or covered fully, by insurance. We may be required to expend material amounts of capital to repair any facilities, the expenditure of which could adversely affect our business and cash flows. Changes in the insurance markets attributable to terrorist attacks may make certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain. Moreover, the insurance that may be available to us may be significantly more expensive than our existing insurance coverage. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war could also affect our ability to raise capital.. The amount of natural gas we gather, compress, treat, process, transport, sell and store, or the NGLs we produce, fractionate, transport, sell and store, may be reduced if the pipelines and storage fractionation facilities to which we deliver the natural gas or NGLs are capacity constrained and cannot, or will not, accept the natural gas or NGLs.. The natural gas we gather, compress, treat, process, transport, sell and store is delivered into pipelines for further delivery to end-users. If these pipelines are capacity constrained and cannot, or will not, accept delivery of the gas due to downstream constraints on the pipeline or changes in interstate pipeline gas quality specifications, we may be forced to limit or stop the flow of gas through our pipelines and processing and treating facilities. In addition, interruption of pipeline service upstream of our processing facilities would limit or stop flow through our processing and fractionation facilities. Likewise, if the pipelines into which we deliver NGLs are interrupted, we may be limited in, or prevented from conducting, our NGL transportation operations. Any number of factors beyond our control could cause such interruptions or constraints on pipeline service, including necessary and scheduled maintenance, or unexpected damage to the pipelines. Because our revenues and net operating margins depend upon (i) the volumes of natural gas we process, gather and transmit, (ii) the throughput of NGLs through our transportation, fractionation and storage facilities and (iii) the volume of natural gas we gather and transport, any reduction of volumes could adversely affect our operations and cash flows available for distribution to our unitholders.. Risks Inherent in an Investment in Our Common Units. Conflicts of interest may exist between our individual unitholders and DCP Midstream, LLC, our general partner, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations.. DCP Midstream, LLC owns and controls our general partner. Some of our general partner's directors and all of its executive officers are directors or executive officers of DCP Midstream, LLC or its owners. Therefore, conflicts of interest may arise between DCP Midstream, LLC and its affiliates and our unitholders. In resolving these conflicts of interest, our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our unitholders. These conflicts include, among others, the following situations:. • neither our Partnership Agreement nor any other agreement requires DCP Midstream, LLC to pursue a business strategy that favors us. DCP Midstream, LLC's directors and officers have a fiduciary duty to make these decisions in the best interests of the owners of DCP Midstream, LLC, which may be contrary to our interests;. 35. • our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us, such as DCP Midstream, LLC and its affiliates, in resolving conflicts of interest;. • DCP Midstream, LLC and its affiliates, including Phillips 66 and Enbridge, are not limited in their ability to compete with us. Please read \"DCP Midstream, LLC and its affiliates are not limited in their ability to compete with us\" below;. • once certain requirements are met, our general partner may make a determination to receive a quantity of our Class B units in exchange for resetting the target distribution levels related to its incentive distribution rights without the approval of the special committee of our general partner or our unitholders;. • our general partner has limited its liability and reduced its fiduciary duties, and has also restricted the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that, without the limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty;. • our general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, borrowings, issuance of additional partnership securities and reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to unitholders;. • our general partner determines the amount and timing of any capital expenditures and whether a capital expenditure is a maintenance capital expenditure, which reduces operating surplus, or an expansion capital expenditure, which does not reduce operating surplus. This determination can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders;. • our general partner determines which costs incurred by it and its affiliates are reimbursable by us;. • our Partnership Agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf;. • our general partner intends to limit its liability regarding our contractual and other obligations and, in some circumstances, is entitled to be indemnified by us;. • our general partner may exercise its limited right to call and purchase common units if it and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units;. • our general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by our general partner and its affiliates; and. • our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us.. DCP Midstream, LLC and its affiliates are not limited in their ability to compete with us, which could cause conflicts of interest and limit our ability to acquire additional assets or businesses, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.. Neither our Partnership Agreement nor the Services and Employee Secondment Agreement, or the Services Agreement, between us and DCP Midstream, LLC prohibits DCP Midstream, LLC and its affiliates, including Phillips 66 and Enbridge, from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. In addition, DCP Midstream, LLC and its affiliates, including Phillips 66 and Enbridge, may acquire, construct or dispose of additional midstream or other assets in the future, without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase or construct any of those assets. Each of these entities is a large, established participant in the midstream energy business, and each has significantly greater resources than we have, which factors may make it more difficult for us to compete with these entities with respect to commercial activities as well as for acquisition candidates. As a result, competition from these entities could adversely impact our results of operations and cash available for distribution.. Cost reimbursements due to our general partner and its affiliates for services provided, which will be determined by our general partner, will be material.. Pursuant to the Services Agreement, DCP Midstream, LLC and its affiliates will receive reimbursement for the payment of operating expenses related to our operations and for the provision of various general and administrative services for our benefit. Payments for these services will be material. In addition, under Delaware partnership law, our general partner has unlimited liability for our obligations, such as our debts and environmental liabilities, except for our contractual obligations that are expressly made without recourse to our general partner. To the extent our general partner incurs obligations on our behalf, we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify it. If we are unable or unwilling to reimburse or indemnify our general partner, our general partner may take actions to cause us to make payments of these obligations and liabilities. These factors may reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders.. Our Partnership Agreement limits our general partner's fiduciary duties to holders of our common units.. Although our general partner has a fiduciary duty to manage us in a manner beneficial to us and our unitholders, the directors and officers of our general partner have a fiduciary duty to manage our general partner in a manner beneficial to its. 36. owner, DCP Midstream, LLC. Our Partnership Agreement contains provisions that reduce the standards to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty laws. For example, our Partnership Agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions either in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner or otherwise free of fiduciary duties to us and our unitholders. This entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires, and it has no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or any limited partner. Examples include:. • the exercise of its right to reset the target distribution levels of its incentive distribution rights at higher levels and receive, in connection with this reset, a number of Class B units that are convertible at any time following the first anniversary of the issuance of these Class B units into common units;. • its limited call right;. • its voting rights with respect to the units it owns;. • its registration rights; and. • its determination whether or not to consent to any merger or consolidation of the partnership or amendment to the Partnership Agreement.. By purchasing a common unit, a common unitholder will agree to become bound by the provisions in the Partnership Agreement, including the provisions discussed above.. Our Partnership Agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of our common units for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.. Our Partnership Agreement contains provisions that restrict the remedies available to our unitholders for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. For example, our Partnership Agreement:. • provides that our general partner will not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as a general partner so long as it acted in good faith, meaning it believed the decision was in the best interests of our partnership;. • generally provides that affiliated transactions and resolutions of conflicts of interest not approved by the special committee of the board of directors of our general partner and not involving a vote of our unitholders must be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or must be \"fair and reasonable\" to us, as determined by our general partner in good faith and that, in determining whether a transaction or resolution is \"fair and reasonable,\" our general partner may consider the totality of the relationships between the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly advantageous or beneficial to us; and provides that our general partner and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us, our limited partners or assignees for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the general partner or those other persons acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the conduct was criminal.. Our general partner may elect to cause us to issue Class B units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to our general partner's incentive distribution rights without the approval of the special committee of our general partner or holders of our common units. This may result in lower distributions to holders of our common units in certain situations.. Our general partner currently has the right to reset the initial cash target distribution levels at higher levels based on the distribution at the time of the exercise of the reset election. Following a reset election by our general partner, the minimum quarterly distribution amount will be reset to an amount equal to the average cash distribution amount per common unit for the two fiscal quarters immediately preceding the reset election, or the reset minimum quarterly distribution, and the target distribution levels will be reset to correspondingly higher levels based on percentage increases above the reset minimum quarterly distribution amount. Currently, our distribution to our general partner related to its incentive distribution rights is at the highest level.. In connection with resetting these target distribution levels, our general partner will be entitled to receive a number of Class B units. The Class B units will be entitled to the same cash distributions per unit as our common units and will be convertible into an equal number of common units. The number of Class B units to be issued will be equal to that number of common units whose aggregate quarterly cash distributions equaled the average of the distributions to our general partner on the incentive distribution rights in the prior two quarters. We anticipate that our general partner would exercise this reset right in order to facilitate acquisitions or internal growth projects that would not be sufficiently accretive to cash distributions per common unit without such conversion; however, it is possible that our general partner could exercise this reset election at a time when it is experiencing, or may be expected to experience, declines in the cash distributions it receives related to its. 37. incentive distribution rights and may therefore desire to be issued our Class B units, which are entitled to receive cash distributions from us on the same priority as our common units, rather than retain the right to receive incentive distributions based on the initial target distribution levels. As a result, in certain situations, a reset election may cause our common unitholders to experience dilution in the amount of cash distributions that they would have otherwise received had we not issued new Class B units to our general partner in connection with resetting the target distribution levels related to our general partner incentive distribution rights.. Holders of our common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our general partner or its directors.. Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management's decisions regarding our business. Our unitholders do not elect our general partner or its board of directors, and have no right to elect our general partner or its board of directors on an annual or other continuing basis. The board of directors of our general partner are chosen by the members of our general partner. As a result of these limitations, the price at which the common units trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price.. Our common units may experience price volatility.. Our common unit price has experienced volatility in the past, and volatility in the price of our common units may occur in the future as a result of any of the risk factors contained herein and the risks described in our other public filings with the SEC. For instance, our common units may experience price volatility as a result of changes in investor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners and our industry in general, which may be influenced by volatility in prices for NGLs, natural gas and crude oil. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies but affect the market price of their securities. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common units.. Even if our unitholders are dissatisfied, they may be unable to remove our general partner without its consent.. The unitholders may be unable to remove our general partner without its consent because our general partner and its affiliates own a significant percentage of our outstanding units. The vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of all outstanding common units is required to remove the general partner. As of December 31, 2017, our general partner and its affiliates owned approximately 36% of our outstanding common units.. Our Partnership Agreement restricts the voting rights of our unitholders owning 20% or more of any class of our units.. Our unitholders' voting rights are further restricted by the Partnership Agreement provision providing that any units held by a person that owns 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding, other than our general partner, its affiliates, their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our general partner, cannot vote on any matter. Our Partnership Agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of our unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting our unitholders' ability to influence the manner or direction of management.. If we are deemed an \"investment company\" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, it would adversely affect the price of our common units and could have a material adverse effect on our business.. Our assets include certain equity investments, such as minority ownership interests in joint ventures, which may be deemed to be \"investment securities\" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"Investment Company Act\"). In the future, we may acquire additional minority-owned interests in joint ventures that could be deemed \"investment securities.\" If a sufficient amount of our assets are deemed to be \"investment securities\" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act, we would either have to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, obtain exemptive relief from the SEC or modify our organizational structure or our contract rights to fall outside the definition of an investment company. Registering as an investment company could, among other things, materially limit our ability to engage in transactions with affiliates, including the purchase and sale of certain securities or other property to or from our affiliates, restrict our ability to borrow funds or engage in other transactions involving leverage and require us to add additional directors who are independent of us or our affiliates. The occurrence of some or all of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business.. Moreover, treatment of us as an investment company would prevent our qualification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes in which case we would be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, and be subject to federal. 38. income tax at the corporate tax rate, which could significantly reduce the cash available for distributions. Additionally, distributions to our unitholders would be taxed again as corporate distributions and none of our income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to our unitholders.. Additionally, as a result of our desire to avoid having to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may have to forgo potential future acquisitions of interests in companies that may be deemed to be investment securities within the meaning of the Investment Company Act or dispose of our current interests in any of our assets that are deemed to be \"investment securities.\". Control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.. Our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Furthermore, under our Partnership Agreement the owners of our general partner may pledge, impose a lien or transfer all or a portion of their respective ownership interest in our general partner to a third party. Any new owners of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of the general partner with its own choices and thereby influence the decisions taken by the board of directors and officers.. We may generally issue additional units, including units that are senior to our common units, without our unitholders' approval, which would dilute our unitholders' existing ownership interests.. Our Partnership Agreement does not limit the number of additional common units that we may issue at any time without the approval of our unitholders. The issuance by us of additional common units, preferred units, or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:. • our unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease, including a relative dilution of any voting rights;. • the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease;. • the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase;. • the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and. • the market price of the common units may decline.. We are prohibited from paying distributions on our common units if distributions on our Series A Preferred Units are in arrears.. The holders of our Series A Preferred Units are entitled to certain rights that are senior to the rights of holders of common units, such as rights to distributions and rights upon liquidation of the Partnership. If we do not pay the required distributions on our Series A Preferred Units, we will be unable to pay distributions on our common units. Additionally, because distributions to our Series A Preferred Unitholders are cumulative, we will have to pay all unpaid accumulated preferred distributions before we can pay any distributions to our common unitholders. Also, because distributions to our common unitholders are not cumulative, if we do not pay distributions on our common units with respect to any quarter, our common unitholders will not be entitled to receive distributions covering any prior periods if we later commence paying distributions on our common units. The preferences and privileges of the Series A Preferred Units could adversely affect the market price for our common units, or could make it more difficult for us to sell our common units in the future.. Our Series A Preferred Units are subordinated to our existing and future debt obligations, and your interests could be diluted by the issuance of additional units, including additional Series A Preferred Units, and by other transactions.. The Series A Preferred Units are subordinated to all of our existing and future indebtedness. The payment of principal and interest on our debt reduces cash available for distribution to our limited partners, including the holders of Series A Preferred Units. The issuance of additional units on parity with or senior to the Series A Preferred Units (including additional Series A Preferred Units) would dilute the interests of the holders of the Series A Preferred Units, and any issuance of equal or senior ranking securities or additional indebtedness could affect our ability to pay distributions on, redeem or pay the liquidation preference on the Series A Preferred Units.. We distribute all of our available cash to our common unitholders and are not required to accumulate cash for the purpose of meeting our future obligations to holders of the Series A Preferred Units, which may limit the cash available to make distributions on the Series A Preferred Units.. Our Partnership Agreement requires us to distribute all of our \"available cash\" each quarter to our common unitholders. \"Available cash\" is defined in our Partnership Agreement and described below under \"Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common. 39. Equity, Related Unitholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Common Units - Distributions of Available Cash - Definition of Available Cash.\" As a result, we do not expect to accumulate significant amounts of cash. Depending on the timing and amount of our cash distributions, these distributions could significantly reduce the cash available to us in subsequent periods to make payments on the Series A Preferred Units.. Our general partner including its affiliates may sell units in the public or private markets, which could reduce the market price of our outstanding common units.. If our general partner or its affiliates holding unregistered common units were to dispose of a substantial portion of these units in the public market, whether in a single transaction or series of transactions, it could reduce the market price of our outstanding common units. In addition, these sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, could make it more difficult for us to sell our common units in the future.. Our general partner has a limited call right that may require our unitholders to sell their units at an undesirable time or price.. If at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units, our general partner will have the right, but not the obligation, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than their then-current market price. As a result, our common unitholders may be required to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on their investment. Our common unitholders may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their common units.. The liability of holders of limited partner interests may not be limited if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of our business.. A general partner of a partnership generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership, except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner. Our partnership is organized under Delaware law and we conduct business in a number of other states. The limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some of the other states in which we do business. Holders of limited partner interests could be liable for any and all of our obligations as if such holder were a general partner if:. • a court or government agency determined that we were conducting business in a state but had not complied with that particular state's partnership statute; or. • the right of holders of limited partner interests to act with other unitholders to remove or replace the general partner, to approve some amendments to our Partnership Agreement or to take other actions under our Partnership Agreement constitute \"control\" of our business.. Unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them.. Under certain circumstances, our unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, we may not make a distribution to our unitholders if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount. Substituted limited partners are liable for the obligations of the assignor to make contributions to the partnership that are known to the substituted limited partner at the time it became a limited partner and for unknown obligations if the liabilities could be determined from the Partnership Agreement. Liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interest and liabilities that are non-recourse to the partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted.. Tax Risks to Unitholders. Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, as well as our being subject to minimal entity-level taxation by individual states. If the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, or we become subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, it would substantially reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders.. The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in the common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. We have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the IRS regarding our status as a partnership.. 40. Despite the fact that we are a limited partnership under Delaware law, it is possible in certain circumstances for a partnership such as ours to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. Although we do not believe based upon our current operations that we will be treated as a corporation, the IRS could disagree with the positions we take or a change in our business (or a change in current law) could cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity.. If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently 21% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and would likely pay state income tax at varying rates. Distributions to a unitholder would generally be taxed again as corporate dividends (to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits), and no income, gains, losses, deductions, or credits would flow through to the unitholder. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to a unitholder would be substantially reduced. Therefore, treatment of us as a corporation for federal tax purposes would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to a unitholder, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our units.. The Partnership Agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for federal, state or local income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution levels will be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us.. The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.. The present federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our units, may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial interpretation at any time. Any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively. Moreover, any such modification could make it more difficult or impossible for us to meet the exception that allows publicly traded partnerships that generate qualifying income to be treated as partnerships (rather than corporations) for federal income tax purposes, affect or cause us to change our business activities, or affect the tax consequences of an investment in our units. The U.S. Treasury Department issued final regulations interpreting the scope of activities that generate qualifying income under Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. We believe that the income we currently treat as qualifying income satisfies the requirements for qualifying income under the final regulations.. Recently enacted legislation provides a deduction to a non-corporate common unitholder, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and ending on or before December 31, 2025, equal to 20% of his or her allocable share of our \"qualified business income.\" For purposes of this deduction, our \"qualified business income\" is equal to the sum of the net amount of our items of income, gain, deduction and loss to the extent such items are included or allowed in the determination of taxable income for the year, excluding, however, certain specified types of passive investment income (such as capital gains and dividends); and any gain recognized upon a disposition of our units to the extent such gain is attributable to certain assets, such as depreciation recapture and our \"inventory items,\" and is thus treated as ordinary income under Section 751 of the Code. This legislation also includes certain new limitations on the use of losses and other deductions to offset taxable income. Various aspects of this deduction and these limitations may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial interpretations at any time, which may or may not be applied retroactively.. Because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons, several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation, which would reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders. For example, we are required to pay the State of Texas a margin tax that is assessed at 0.75% of taxable margin apportioned to Texas. The Partnership Agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity-level taxation for federal, state or local income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution levels will be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us.. Changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.. We are subject to extensive tax laws and regulations, with respect to federal, state and foreign income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted that could result in increased tax expenditures in the future.. 41. If tax authorities contest the tax positions we take, the market for our units may be adversely impacted, and the cost of any contest with a tax authority would reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.. We have not requested a ruling from the IRS with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Tax authorities may adopt positions that differ from the conclusions of our counsel or from the positions we take, and the tax authority's positions may ultimately be sustained. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of our counsel's conclusions or the positions we take. A court may not agree with some or all of our counsel's conclusions or positions we take. Any contest with a tax authority, and the outcome of any such contest, may increase a unitholder's tax liability and result in adjustment to items unrelated to us and could materially and adversely impact the market for our units and the price at which they trade. In addition, our costs of any contest with any tax authority will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner because such costs will reduce our cash available for distribution.. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the procedures for auditing large partnerships and the procedures for assessing and collecting taxes due (including applicable penalties and interest) as a result of an audit have changed. Unless we are eligible to (and choose to) elect to issue revised Schedules K-1 to our partners with respect to an audited and adjusted return, the IRS may assess and collect taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us in the year in which the audit is completed under the new procedures. If we are required to pay taxes, penalties and interest as the result of audit adjustments, cash available for distribution to our unitholders may be substantially reduced. In addition, because payment would be due for the taxable year in which the audit is completed, unitholders during that taxable year would bear the expense of the adjustment even if they were not unitholders during the audited taxable year.. Our unitholders may be required to pay taxes on income from us even if the unitholders do not receive any cash distributions from us.. Because our unitholders will be treated as partners to whom we will allocate taxable income, which could be different in amount than the cash we distribute, unitholders will be required to pay any federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes on their share of our taxable income even if they receive no cash distributions from us. Unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the tax liability that results from that income.. Certain actions that we may take, such as issuing additional units, may increase the federal income tax liability of unitholders.. In the event we issue additional units or engage in certain other transactions in the future, the allocable share of nonrecourse liabilities allocated to the unitholders will be recalculated to take into account our issuance of any additional units. Any reduction in a unitholder's share of our nonrecourse liabilities will be treated as a distribution of cash to that unitholder and will result in a corresponding tax basis reduction in a unitholder's units. A deemed cash distribution may, under certain circumstances, result in the recognition of taxable gain by a unitholder, to the extent that the deemed cash distribution exceeds such unitholder's tax basis in its units.. In addition, the federal income tax liability of a unitholder could be increased if we dispose of assets or make a future offering of units and use the proceeds in a manner that does not produce substantial additional deductions, such as to repay indebtedness currently outstanding or to acquire property that is not eligible for depreciation or amortization for federal income tax purposes or that is depreciable or amortizable at a rate significantly slower than the rate currently applicable to our assets.. Tax gain or loss on disposition of common units could be more or less than expected.. If a unitholder sells its common units, the unitholder will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the unitholder's tax basis in those common units. Because distributions to a unitholder in excess of the total net taxable income allocated to it for a common unit decreases its tax basis in that common unit, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the units sold will, in effect, become taxable income to the unitholder if the common unit is sold at a price greater than their tax basis in that common unit, even if the price is less than their original cost. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items, including depreciation recapture. In addition, because the amount realized includes a unitholder's share of our nonrecourse liabilities, if a unitholder sells its units, the unitholder may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash the unitholder receives from the sale.. 42. Tax-exempt entities and non-U.S. persons face unique tax issues from owning units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.. Investment in units by tax-exempt entities, such as individual retirement accounts, or IRAs, other retirement plans and non-U.S. persons raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax, including IRAs and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable income, which may be taxable to them.. Distributions to non-U.S. persons will be reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate, and non-U.S. persons will be required to file United States federal tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income. Gain recognized from a sale or other disposition of our units by a non-U.S. person will be subject to federal income tax as income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. Moreover, the transferee of our units is generally required to withhold 10% of the amount realized by the transferor unless the transferor certifies that it is not a foreign person, and we are required to deduct and withhold from the transferee amounts that should have been withheld by the transferees but were not withheld. Because the \"amount realized\" includes a partner's share of the partnership's liabilities, 10% of the amount realized could exceed the total cash purchase price for the units. However, the IRS has suspended the application of this withholding rule to open market transfers of interest in publicly traded partnerships, pending promulgation of regulations or other guidance that address the amount to be withheld, the reporting necessary to determine such amount and the appropriate party to withhold such amounts. It is not clear if or when such regulations or other guidance will be issued.. If a unitholder is a tax-exempt entity or a non-U.S. person, the unitholder should consult its tax advisor before investing in our units.. We treat each purchaser of our common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units.. Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and because of other reasons, we have adopted depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury regulations. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to the unitholders. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from the sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders' tax returns.. We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.. We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The U.S. Treasury Department has adopted final regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which publicly traded partnerships may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferor and transferee unitholders. These regulations do not specifically authorize the proration method we have previously used. If the IRS were to challenge our proration method or new Treasury regulations were issued, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.. 43. A unitholder whose units are loaned to a \"short seller\" to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of those units. If so, the unitholder would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may be required to recognize gain or loss from the disposition.. Because a unitholder whose units are loaned to a \"short seller\" to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units, the unitholder may no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan to the short seller and such unitholder may be required to recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan to the short seller, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing and lending their units.. We have adopted certain valuation methodologies that may result in a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between the general partner and the unitholders. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the units.. When we issue additional units or engage in certain other transactions, we determine the fair market value of our assets and allocate any unrealized gain or loss attributable to our assets to the capital accounts of our unitholders and our general partner. Our methodology may be viewed as understating the value of our assets. In that case, there may be a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between certain unitholders and the general partner, which may be unfavorable to such unitholders. Moreover, subsequent purchasers of our units may have a greater portion of their adjustment under Section 743(b) of the Code allocated to our tangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to our intangible assets. The IRS may challenge our valuation methods, or our allocation of the Section 743(b) adjustment attributable to our tangible and intangible assets, and allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction between the general partner and certain of our unitholders.. A successful IRS challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders. It also could affect the amount of gain from our unitholders' sale of our units and could have a negative impact on the value of our units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders' tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions.. Treatment of distributions on our Series A Preferred Units as guaranteed payments for the use of capital creates a different tax treatment for the holders of Series A Preferred Units than the holders of our common units.. The tax treatment of distributions on our Series A Preferred Units is uncertain. We will treat the holders of our Series A Preferred Units as partners for tax purposes and will treat distributions on our Series A Preferred Units as guaranteed payments for the use of capital that will generally be taxable to the holders of our Series A Preferred Units as ordinary income and will not be eligible for the deduction provided for under Code Section 199A. Although a holder of our Series A Preferred Units could recognize taxable income from the accrual of such a guaranteed payment even in the absence of a contemporaneous distribution, we anticipate accruing and making the guaranteed payment distributions semi-annually through and including December 15, 2022 and quarterly thereafter. Because the guaranteed payment for each unit must accrue as income to a holder during the taxable year of the accrual, the guaranteed payment attributable to the period beginning December 15 and ending December 31 will accrue as income to the holder of record of a Series A Preferred Unit on December 31 for such period, regardless of whether such holder continues to own the Series A Preferred Unit at the time the actual distribution is made. Otherwise, the holders of our Series A Preferred Units are generally not anticipated to share in our items of income, gain, loss or deduction, except to the extent necessary to provide, to the extent possible, the Series A Preferred Units with the benefit of the liquidation preference. We will not allocate any share of our nonrecourse liabilities to the holders of our Series A Preferred Units. If our Series A Preferred Units were treated as indebtedness for tax purposes, rather than as partnership interests, distributions on our Series A Preferred Units likely would be treated as payments of interest by us to the holders of our Series A Preferred Units, rather than as guaranteed payments for the use of capital.. A holder of our Series A Preferred Units will be required to recognize gain or loss on a sale of its Series A Preferred Units equal to the difference between the amount realized by such holder and tax basis in the Series A Preferred Units sold. The amount realized generally will equal the sum of the cash and the fair market value of other property such holder receives in exchange for such Series A Preferred Units. Subject to general rules requiring a blended basis among multiple partnership interests, the tax basis of a Series A Preferred Unit will generally be equal to the sum of the cash and the fair market value of other property paid by the holder of the Series A Preferred Unit to acquire such Series A Preferred Unit. Gain or loss recognized by a holder of a Series A Preferred Unit on the sale or exchange of a Series A Preferred Unit held for more than one year generally will be taxable as long-term capital gain or loss. Because holders of our Series A Preferred Units will generally not be. 44. allocated a share of our items of depreciation, depletion or amortization, it is not anticipated that such holders would be required to recharacterize any portion of their gain as ordinary income as a result of the recapture rules.. Unitholders may be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in states where they do not live as a result of investing in our units.. In addition to federal income taxes, unitholders may be subject to other taxes, including foreign, state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property, even if the unitholders do not live in any of those jurisdictions. Unitholders may be required to file foreign, state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these jurisdictions. Further, the unitholder may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. As we make acquisitions or expand our business, we may own assets or do business in additional states that impose a personal income tax or an entity level tax. It is each unitholder's responsibility to file all United States federal, foreign, state and local tax returns. Our counsel has not rendered an opinion on the foreign, state or local tax consequences of an investment in our units."
