[1] "Item 1A - Risk Factors. Following are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report or the Company’s other filings with the SEC. These risks should be read in conjunction with the other risks described in this report, including but not limited to those described in “Taxation” and “Government Regulation and Reimbursement” under “Item 1” above. The risks described in this report are not the only risks facing the Company and there may be additional risks of which the Company is not presently aware or that the Company currently considers unlikely to significantly impact the Company. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks, and, as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline.. Risks Related to the Operators of Our Facilities. Our financial position could be weakened and our ability to make distributions and fulfill our obligations with respect to our indebtedness could be limited if our operators, or a portion thereof, become unable to meet their obligations to us or fail to renew or extend their relationship with us as their lease terms expire or their mortgages mature, or if we become unable to lease or re-lease our facilities or make mortgage loans on economically favorable terms. We have no operational control over our operators. Adverse developments concerning our operators could arise due to a number of factors, including those listed below.. The bankruptcy or insolvency of our operators could limit or delay our ability to recover on our investments.. We are exposed to the risk that a distressed or insolvent operator may not be able to meet its lease, loan, mortgage or other obligations to us or other third parties. This risk is heightened during a period of economic or political instability. Although each of our lease and loan agreements typically provides us with the right to terminate, evict an operator, foreclose on our collateral, demand immediate payment and exercise other remedies upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of an operator, title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) would limit or, at a minimum, delay our ability to collect unpaid pre-bankruptcy rents and mortgage payments and to pursue other remedies against a bankrupt operator. While we sometimes have third party guarantees of an operator’s lease or loan obligations, such guarantees can be expensive to enforce, and have their own risks of collection as against the guarantors.. Leases. A bankruptcy filing by one of our lessee operators would typically prevent us from collecting unpaid pre-bankruptcy rents or evicting the operator, absent approval of the bankruptcy court. The Bankruptcy Code provides a lessee with the option to assume or reject an unexpired lease within certain specified periods of time. Generally, a lessee is required to pay all rent that becomes payable between the date of its bankruptcy filing and the date of the assumption or rejection of the lease (although such payments will likely be delayed as a result of the bankruptcy filing). If one of our lessee operators chooses to assume its lease with us, the operator must promptly cure all monetary defaults existing under the lease (including payment of unpaid pre-bankruptcy rents) and provide adequate assurance of its ability to perform its future lease obligations. Even where a lessee operator assumes its lease with us, it will first often threaten to reject that lease to obtain better lease terms from us, and we sometimes have to consider making, or we do make, such economic concessions to avoid rejection of the lease and our taking a closed facility back. If one of our lessee operators opts to reject its lease with us, we would have a claim against such operator for unpaid and future rents payable under the lease, but such claim would be subject to a statutory “cap” under the Bankruptcy Code, and would likely result in a recovery substantially less than the face value of such claim. Although the operator’s rejection of the lease would permit us to recover possession of the leased facility, we would likely face losses, costs and delays associated with repairs and/or maintenance of the facility and then re-leasing the facility to a new operator, or costs associated with selling the facility. In any event, re-leasing a facility or selling it could take a material amount of time, and the pool of interested and qualified tenants or buyers will be limited due to the unique nature of our properties, which may depress values and our eventual recovery. Finally, whether a lease operator in bankruptcy ends up assuming or rejecting our lease, we will incur legal and collection costs, which can be difficult or impossible to recover.. 20. Several other factors could impact our rights under leases with bankrupt operators. First, the operator could seek to assign its lease with us to a third party. The Bankruptcy Code disregards anti-assignment provisions in leases to permit the assignment of unexpired leases to third parties (provided all monetary defaults under the lease are promptly cured and the assignee can demonstrate its ability to perform its obligations under the lease). Second, in instances in which we have entered into a master lease agreement with an operator that operates more than one facility, the bankruptcy court could determine that the master lease was comprised of separate, divisible leases (each of which could be separately assumed or rejected), rather than a single, integrated lease (which would have to be assumed or rejected in its entirety). Finally, the bankruptcy court could re-characterize our lease agreement as a disguised financing arrangement, which could require us to receive bankruptcy court approval to foreclose or pursue other remedies with respect to the facility.. Mortgages. A bankruptcy filing by an operator to which we have made a loan secured by a mortgage would typically prevent us from collecting unpaid pre-bankruptcy mortgage payments and foreclosing on our collateral, absent approval of the bankruptcy court. As an initial matter, we could ask the bankruptcy court to order the operator to make periodic payments or provide other financial assurances to us during the bankruptcy case (known as “adequate protection”), but the ultimate decision regarding “adequate protection” (including the timing and amount of any “adequate protection” payments) rests with the bankruptcy court. In addition, we would need bankruptcy court approval before commencing or continuing any foreclosure action against the operator’s collateral (including a facility). The bankruptcy court could withhold such approval, especially if the operator can demonstrate that the facility or other collateral is necessary for an effective reorganization and that we have a sufficient “equity cushion” in the facility or that we are otherwise protected from any diminution in value of the collateral. If the bankruptcy court does not either grant us “adequate protection” or permit us to foreclose on our collateral, we may not receive any loan payments until after the bankruptcy court confirms a plan of reorganization for the operator. In addition, in any bankruptcy case of an operator to which we have made a loan, the operator may seek bankruptcy court approval to pay us (i) over a longer period of time than the terms of our loan, (ii) at a different interest rate, and/or (iii) for only the value of the collateral, instead of the full amount of the loan. Finally, even if the bankruptcy court permits us to foreclose on the facility, we would still be subject to the losses, costs and other risks associated with a foreclosure sale, including possible successor liability under government programs, indemnification obligations and suspension or delay of third-party payments. Should such events occur, our income and cash flow from operations would be adversely affected.. Failure by our operators to comply with various local, state and federal government regulations may adversely impact their ability to make debt or lease payments to us.. Our operators are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those described below, that are subject to frequent and substantial changes (sometimes applied retroactively) resulting from new legislation, adoption of rules and regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law. The ultimate timing or effect of these changes cannot be predicted. These changes may have a dramatic effect on our operators’ costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by both government and other third-party payors. The failure of any of our operators to comply with these laws, requirements and regulations could adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us.. ·Reimbursement;                                          Medicare and Medicaid. A significant portion of our operators’ revenue is derived                                          from governmentally-funded reimbursement programs, primarily Medicare and Medicaid. See                                          “Item 1. Business – Government Regulation and Reimbursement – Healthcare                                          Reform,” “– Reimbursement Generally,” “– Medicaid,” and “–                                          Medicare,” and the risk factor entitled “Our operators depend                                          on reimbursement from governmental and other third-party payors, and reimbursement rates                                          from such payors may be reduced” for a further discussion on governmental and                                          third-party payor reimbursement and the associated risks presented to our operators.                                          Failure to maintain certification in these programs would result in a loss of reimbursement                                          from such programs and could result in a reduction in an operator’s revenues and                                          operating margins, thereby negatively impacting an operator’s ability to meet its                                          obligations to us.. ·Quality                                          of Care Initiatives. The CMS has implemented a number of initiatives focused on the                                          quality of care provided by nursing homes that could affect our operators, including                                          a quality rating system for nursing homes. See “Item 1. Business – Government                                          Regulation and Reimbursement – Quality of Care Initiatives.” Any                                          unsatisfactory rating of our operators under any rating system promulgated by the CMS                                          could result in the loss of our operators’ residents or lower reimbursement rates,                                          which could adversely impact their revenues and our business.. 21. ·Licensing                                          and Certification. Our operators and facilities are subject to various federal, state                                          and local licensing and certification laws and regulations, including laws and regulations                                          under Medicare and Medicaid requiring operators of SNFs and ALFs to comply with extensive                                          standards governing operations. See “Item 1. Business – Government Regulation                                          and Reimbursement – Licensing and Certification.” Governmental agencies                                          administering these laws and regulations regularly inspect our operators’ facilities                                          and investigate complaints. Our operators and their managers receive notices of observed                                          violations and deficiencies from time to time, and sanctions have been imposed from time                                          to time on facilities operated by them. Failure to obtain any required licensure or certification,                                          the loss or suspension of any required licensure or certification, or any violations                                          or deficiencies with respect to relevant operating standards may require a facility to                                          cease operations or result in ineligibility for reimbursement until the necessary licenses                                          or certifications are obtained or reinstated, or any such violations or deficiencies                                          are cured. In such event, our revenues from these facilities could be reduced or eliminated                                          for an extended period of time or permanently. Additionally, many states require certain                                          healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need, which requires prior approval for                                          the construction, expansion, closure or change of ownership of certain healthcare facilities,                                          which has the potential to impact some of our operators’ abilities to expand or                                          change their businesses. Further, Medicare and Medicaid provider approvals, as applicable,                                          may be needed prior to an operator’s change of ownership.. ·Fraud                                          and Abuse Laws and Regulations. There are various federal and state civil and criminal                                          laws and regulations governing a wide array of healthcare provider referrals, relationships                                          and arrangements, including laws and regulations prohibiting fraud by healthcare providers.                                          Many of these complex laws raise issues that have not been clearly interpreted by the                                          relevant governmental authorities and courts and are subject to change. In addition,                                          federal and state governments are devoting increasing attention and resources to anti-fraud                                          investigations and initiatives against healthcare providers, and provide for, among other                                          things, claims to be filed by qui tam relators. See “Item 1. Business                                          – Government Regulation and Reimbursement – Fraud and Abuse.” The                                          violation by an operator of any of these extensive laws or regulations, including the                                          Anti-kickback statute, False Claims Act and the Stark Law, could result in the imposition                                          of criminal fines and imprisonment, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from Medicare,                                          Medicaid and all other federal and state healthcare programs. Such fines or penalties,                                          in addition to expending considerable resources responding to an investigation or enforcement                                          action, could adversely affect an operator’s financial position and jeopardize                                          an operator’s ability to make lease or mortgage payments to us or to continue operating                                          its facility. Additionally, many states have adopted or are considering legislative proposals                                          similar to the federal anti-fraud and abuse laws, some of which extend beyond the Medicare                                          and Medicaid programs to third-party payors, to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration                                          for the referral of patients and physician self-referrals, regardless of whether the                                          service was reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid.. ·Privacy                                          Laws. Our operators are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations                                          designed to protect the privacy and security of patient health information, including                                          HIPAA, among others. See “Item 1. Business – Government Regulation and                                          Reimbursement – Privacy.” These laws and regulations require our operators                                          to expend the requisite resources to protect and secure patient health information, including                                          the funding of costs associated with technology upgrades. Operators found in violation                                          of HIPAA or any other privacy or security law may face significant monetary penalties.                                          In addition, a breach of unsecured protected health information could cause reputational                                          harm to an operator’s business in addition to a material adverse effect on the                                          operator’s financial position and cash flows.. ·Other                                          Laws. Other federal, state and local laws and regulations affect how our operators                                          conduct their operations. See “Item 1. Business – Government Regulation                                          and Reimbursement – Other Laws and Regulations.” We cannot predict the                                          effect that the costs of complying with these laws may have on the revenues of our operators,                                          and thus their ability to meet their obligations to us.. 22. ·Legislative                                          and Regulatory Developments. Each year, legislative and regulatory proposals                                          are introduced at the federal, state and local levels that, if adopted, would result                                          in major changes to the healthcare system. See “Item 1. Business –                                          Government Regulation and Reimbursement” in addition to the other risk factors                                          set forth below. We cannot accurately predict whether any proposals will be adopted,                                          and if adopted, what effect (if any) these proposals would have on our operators or our                                          business. If we fail to effectively implement or appropriately adjust our operational                                          and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of new laws and regulations,                                          or do not do so as effectively as our competitors, our results of operations may be materially                                          adversely affected. Changes to, or repeal of, the Healthcare Reform Law could materially                                          and adversely affect our business and financial position, results of operations or cash                                          flows. Even if the Healthcare Reform Law is not amended or repealed, changes impacting                                          implementation of the Healthcare Reform Law, could materially and adversely affect our                                          financial position or operations. However, the ultimate content, timing or effect of                                          any potential future legislation cannot be predicted.. Alternative payment models require certain changes to reimbursement and studies of reimbursement policies that may adversely affect payments to SNFs.. Alternative payment models, as well as other legislative initiatives included in the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 and other laws introduced by Congress, have the potential to affect Medicare payments to SNFs, including, but not limited to, provisions changing the payment methodology, setting reimbursement caps, implementing value-based purchasing and payment bundling, and studying the appropriateness of restrictions on payments for health care acquired conditions. Several commercial payors have expressed an intent to pursue certain value-based purchasing models and initiatives. These provisions are in various stages of implementation. See “Item 1. Business – Government Regulation and Reimbursement – Healthcare Reform,” “– Reimbursement Generally,” and “– Medicare.” Although we cannot accurately predict the extent to which or how such provisions may be implemented, or the effect any such implementation would have on our operators or our business, these provisions could result in decreases in payments to our operators, increase our operators’ costs or otherwise adversely affect the results of operations or financial condition of our operators, thereby negatively impacting their ability to meet their obligations to us.. The Healthcare Reform Law imposes additional requirements on SNFs regarding compliance and disclosure.. The Healthcare Reform Law requires SNFs to have a compliance and ethics program that is effective in preventing and detecting criminal, civil and administrative violations and in promoting quality of care. HHS included in Final Rule published on October 4, 2016 the requirement for operators to implement a compliance and ethics program as a condition of participation in Medicare and Medicaid. Long-term care facilities, including SNFs, have until November 28, 2019 to comply. See “Item 1. Business – Government Regulation and Reimbursement – Reform Requirements for Long-Term Care Facilities” for a further discussion of the reform requirements set forth in the Final Rule. If our operators fall short in their compliance and ethics programs and quality assurance and performance improvement programs, if and when required, their reputations and ability to attract residents could be adversely affected.. Our operators depend on reimbursement from governmental and other third-party payors, and reimbursement rates from such payors may be reduced or modified.. Changes in the reimbursement rate or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursements for services provided by our operators has in the past, and could in the future, result in a substantial reduction in our operators’ revenues and operating margins. Additionally, reimbursement from governmental and other third party payors could be reduced as part of retroactive adjustments during claims settlement processes or as result of post-payment audits. See “Item 1. Business – Government Regulation and Reimbursement – Reimbursement Generally,” “– Medicaid,” and “– Medicare.” We currently believe that our operator coverage ratios are adequate and that our operators can absorb moderate reimbursement rate reductions and still meet their obligations to us. However, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates, as well as changes in reimbursement policies or other measures altering payment methodologies for services provided by our operators, could have a material adverse effect on our operators’ results of operations and financial condition, which could cause the revenues of our operators to decline and negatively impact their ability to meet their obligations to us.. 23. Additionally, net revenue realizable under third-party payor agreements can change after examination and retroactive adjustment by payors during the claims settlement processes or as a result of post-payment audits. Payors may disallow requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable or reasonable, additional documentation is necessary or certain services were not covered or were not medically necessary. New legislative and regulatory proposals could impose further limitations on government and private payments to healthcare providers. In some cases, states have enacted or are considering enacting measures designed to reduce Medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare insurance. We cannot make any assurances that adequate third-party payor reimbursement levels will continue to be available for the services provided by our operators.. Government spending cuts or modifications could lead to a reduction in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement.. Approved or proposed cost-containment measures, spending cuts and tax reform initiatives have resulted or could result in changes (including substantial reductions in funding) to Medicare, Medicaid or Medicare Advantage Plans. Any such federal legislation that reduces reimbursement payments to healthcare providers could have a material adverse effect on certain of our operators’ liquidity, financial condition or results of operations, which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a material adverse effect on us. Additionally, as a result of state budget crises and financial shortfalls, many states are focusing on the reduction of expenditures under their Medicaid programs, which may result in a freeze on Medicaid rates or a reduction in reimbursement rates for our operators. See “Item 1. Business – Government Regulation and Reimbursement – Reimbursement Generally,” “– Medicaid,” and “– Medicare.” These potential reductions could be compounded by the potential for federal cost-cutting efforts that could lead to reductions in reimbursement to our operators under both the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Potential reductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement to our operators could reduce the cash flow of our operators and their ability to make rent or mortgage payments to us. The need to control Medicaid expenditures may be exacerbated by the potential for increased enrollment in Medicaid due to unemployment and declines in family incomes. Medicaid enrollment may continue to increase in the future, as the Healthcare Reform Law allowed states to increase the number of people who are eligible for Medicaid in 2014. Since our operators’ profit margins on Medicaid patients are generally relatively low, more than modest reductions in Medicaid reimbursement and an increase in the number of Medicaid patients could place some operators in financial distress, which in turn could adversely affect us. If funding for Medicare and/or Medicaid is reduced, it could have a material adverse effect on our operators’ results of operations and financial condition, which could adversely affect our operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us.. We may be unable to find a replacement operator for one or more of our leased properties.. From time to time, we may need to find a replacement operator for one or more of our leased properties for a variety of reasons, including upon the expiration of the lease term or the occurrence of an operator default. During any period in which we are attempting to locate one or more replacement operators, there could be a decrease or cessation of rental payments on the applicable property or properties. We cannot assure you that any of our current or future operators will elect to renew their respective leases with us upon expiration of the terms thereof. Similarly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to locate a suitable replacement operator or, if we are successful in locating a replacement operator, that the rental payments from the new operator would not be significantly less than the existing rental payments. Our ability to locate a suitable replacement operator may be significantly delayed or limited by various state licensing, receivership, certificate of need or other laws, as well as by Medicare and Medicaid change-of-ownership rules. We also may incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any such licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. Any such delays, limitations and expenses could materially delay or impact our ability to collect rent, obtain possession of leased properties or otherwise exercise remedies for default.. Our operators may be subject to significant legal actions that could result in their increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which may affect their ability to meet their obligations to us.. Our operators may be subject to claims for damages relating to the services that they provide. We can give no assurance that the insurance coverage maintained by our operators will cover all claims made against them or continue to be available at a reasonable cost, if at all. In some states, insurance coverage for the risk of punitive damages arising from professional and general liability claims and/or litigation may not, in certain cases, be available to operators due to state law prohibitions or limitations of availability. As a result, our operators operating in these states may be liable for punitive damage awards that are either not covered or are in excess of their insurance policy limits.. 24. We also believe that there has been, and will continue to be, an increase in governmental investigations of long-term care providers, particularly in the area of Medicare/Medicaid false claims, as well as an increase in enforcement actions resulting from these investigations. Insurance is not available to our operators to cover such losses. Any adverse determination in a legal proceeding or governmental investigation, whether currently asserted or arising in the future, could have a material adverse effect on an operator’s financial condition. If an operator is unable to obtain or maintain insurance coverage, if judgments are obtained in excess of the insurance coverage, if an operator is required to pay uninsured punitive damages, or if an operator is subject to an uninsurable government enforcement action, the operator could be exposed to substantial additional liabilities. Such liabilities could adversely affect the operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us.. In addition, we may in some circumstances be named as a defendant in litigation involving the services provided by our operators. Although we generally have no involvement in the services provided by our operators, and our standard lease agreements and loan agreements generally require our operators to indemnify us and carry insurance to cover us in certain cases, a significant judgment against us in such litigation could exceed our and our operators’ insurance coverage, which would require us to make payments to cover the judgment.. Increased competition as well as increased operating costs result in lower revenues for some of our operators and may affect the ability of our operators to meet their obligations to us.. The long-term healthcare industry is highly competitive and we expect that it may become more competitive in the future. Our operators are competing with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies, life care at home, community-based service programs, retirement communities and convalescent centers. Our operators compete on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided, reputation, the physical appearance of a facility, price, the range of services offered, family preference, alternatives for healthcare delivery, the supply of competing properties, physicians, staff, referral sources, location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding areas. We cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us. Our operators may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses and therefore affect their ability to pay their lease or mortgage payments.. In addition, the market for qualified nurses, healthcare professionals and other key personnel is highly competitive and our operators may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Increases in labor costs due to higher wages and greater benefits required to attract and retain qualified healthcare personnel incurred by our operators could affect their ability to meet their obligations to us. This situation could be particularly acute in certain states that have enacted legislation establishing minimum staffing requirements.. We may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our mortgage loans, and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts, we may be unable to successfully find a replacement operator, or operate or occupy the underlying real estate, which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments.. If an operator defaults under one of our mortgage loans, we may foreclose on the loan or otherwise protect our interest by acquiring title to the property. In such a scenario, we may be required to make substantial improvements or repairs to maximize the facility’s investment potential. Operators may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies and/or bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations. Even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our mortgage loans, we may be unable to expeditiously find a replacement operator, if at all, or otherwise successfully operate or occupy the property, which could adversely affect our ability to recover our investment.. Uninsured losses or losses in excess of our operators’ insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial position and our cash flow.. Under the terms of our leases, our operators are required to maintain comprehensive general liability, fire, flood, earthquake, boiler and machinery, nursing home or long-term care professional liability and extended coverage insurance with respect to our properties with policy specifications, limits and deductibles set forth in the leases or other written agreements between us and the operator. However, our properties may be adversely affected by casualty losses which exceed insurance coverages and reserves. In addition, we cannot provide any assurances that our tenants will maintain the required coverages, that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance under our leases, or that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future or that the policies maintained will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event. We also cannot make any guaranty as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite the policies maintained by our tenants, or, alternatively if our tenants utilize captive or self-insurance programs, that such programs will be adequately funded.. 25. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose both our investment in, and anticipated profits and cash flows from, the property. Even if it were practicable to restore the property to its condition prior to the damage caused by a major casualty, the operations of the affected property would likely be suspended for a considerable period of time. In the event of any substantial loss affecting a property, disputes over insurance claims could arise.. Risks Related to Us and Our Operations. We rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs, and if we encounter difficulty in obtaining such capital, we may not be able to make future investments necessary to grow our business or meet maturing commitments.. To qualify as a REIT under the Code, we are required to, among other things, distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income each year to our stockholders. Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund, from cash retained from operations, all future capital needs, including capital needed to make investments and to satisfy or refinance maturing commitments. As a result, we rely on external sources of capital, including debt and equity financing. If we are unable to obtain needed capital at all or only on unfavorable terms from these sources, we might not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business, or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature, which could negatively affect the ratings of our debt and even, in extreme circumstances, affect our ability to continue operations. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control, including the performance of the national and global economies generally; competition in the healthcare industry; issues facing the healthcare industry, including regulations and government reimbursement policies; our operators’ operating costs; the ratings of our debt securities; the market’s perception of our growth potential; the market value of our properties; our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and the market price of the shares of our capital stock. While we currently have sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our obligations and commitments, we may not be in a position to take advantage of future investment opportunities in the event that we are unable to access the capital markets on a timely basis or we are only able to obtain financing on unfavorable terms.. Our ability to raise capital through equity sales is dependent, in part, on the market price of our common stock, and our failure to meet market expectations with respect to our business could negatively impact the market price of our common stock and availability of equity capital.. As with other publicly-traded companies, the availability of equity capital will depend, in part, on the market price of our common stock which, in turn, will depend upon various market conditions and other factors that may change from time to time including:. ·the                                          extent of investor interest;. ·the                                          general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison                                          to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate-based companies;. ·the                                          financial performance of us and our operators;. ·concentrations                                          in our investment portfolio by tenant and facility type;. ·concerns                                          about our tenants’ financial condition due to uncertainty regarding reimbursement                                          from governmental and other third-party payor programs;. ·analyst                                          reports on us and the REIT industry in general;. ·general                                          stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income                                          securities, which may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to demand a higher                                          annual yield from future distributions;. ·our                                          failure to maintain or increase our dividend, which is dependent, to a large part, on                                          the increase in funds from operations, which in turn depends upon increased revenues                                          from additional investments and rental increases; and. ·other                                          factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in REIT tax laws.. The market value of the equity securities of a REIT is generally based upon the market’s perception of the REIT’s growth potential and its current and potential future earnings and cash distributions. Our failure to meet the market’s expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, as a result, the availability of equity capital to us.. 26. We are subject to risks associated with debt financing, which could negatively impact our business and limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and to repay maturing debt.. The financing required to make future investments and satisfy maturing commitments may be provided by borrowings under our credit facilities, private or public offerings of debt or equity, the assumption of secured indebtedness, mortgage financing on a portion of our owned portfolio or through joint ventures. To the extent we must obtain debt financing from external sources to fund our capital requirements, we cannot guarantee such financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, if we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, our cash flow may not be sufficient to make distributions to our stockholders and repay our maturing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates, changes in our debt ratings or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase, which could reduce our profitability and the amount of dividends we are able to pay. Moreover, additional debt financing increases the amount of our leverage. The degree of leverage could have important consequences to stockholders, including affecting our investment grade ratings and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future, and making us more vulnerable to a downturn in our results of operations or the economy generally.. We may be subject to additional risks in connection with our recent and future acquisitions of long-term care facilities.. We may be subject to additional risks in connection with our recent and future acquisitions of long-term care facilities, including but not limited to the following:. ·our                                          limited prior business experience with certain of the operators of the facilities we                                          have recently acquired or may acquire in the future;. ·the                                          facilities may underperform due to various factors, including unfavorable terms and conditions                                          of the lease agreements that we assume, disruptions caused by the management of the operators                                          of the facilities or changes in economic conditions impacting the facilities and/or the                                          operators;. ·diversion                                          of our management’s attention away from other business concerns;. ·exposure                                          to any undisclosed or unknown potential liabilities relating to the facilities; and. ·potential                                          underinsured losses on the facilities.. We cannot assure you that we will be able to manage our recently acquired or future new facilities without encountering difficulties or that any such difficulties will not have a material adverse effect on us.. Our assets may be subject to impairment charges.. We periodically, but not less than annually, evaluate our real estate investments and other assets for impairment indicators. The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as market conditions, operator performance and legal structure. If we determine that a significant impairment has occurred, we are required to make an adjustment to the net carrying value of the asset, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.. We may not be able to sell certain closed facilities for their book value.. From time to time, we close facilities and actively market such facilities for sale. To the extent we are unable to sell these properties for our book value, we may be required to take a non-cash impairment charge or loss on the sale, either of which would reduce our net income.. 27. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.. We have a material amount of indebtedness and we may increase our indebtedness in the future. Our level and type of indebtedness could have important consequences for our stockholders. For example, it could:. ·increase                                          our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;. ·limit                                          our ability to borrow additional funds, on satisfactory terms or at all, for working                                          capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of                                          our business plan or other general corporate purposes;. ·increase                                          our cost of borrowing;. ·require                                          us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments                                          on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working                                          capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;. ·limit                                          our ability to make material acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities                                          that may arise;. ·limit                                          our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, which may cause us to lose our                                          qualification as a REIT under the Code or to become subject to federal corporate income                                          tax on any REIT taxable income that we do not distribute;. ·expose                                          us to fluctuations in interest rates, to the extent our borrowings bear variable rates                                          of interest;. ·limit                                          our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry                                          in which we operate; and. ·place                                          us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.. Further, we have the ability to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt. If we incur additional debt, the related risks described above could intensify. In addition, if we are unable to refinance any of our floating rate debt, we would continue to be subject to interest rate risk. The short-term nature of some of our debt also subjects us to the risk that market conditions may be unfavorable or may prevent us from refinancing our debt at or prior to their existing maturities. In addition, our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of our outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, if at all, to refinance our debt.. Covenants in our debt documents limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach could materially adversely affect our operations.. The terms of our credit agreements and note indentures require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants that may limit our management’s discretion by restricting our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, redeem our capital stock, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, pay dividends and make other distributions, make investments and other restricted payments, engage in mergers and consolidations, create liens, sell assets or engage in new lines of business. In addition, our credit facilities require us to maintain compliance with specified financial covenants, including those relating to maximum total leverage, maximum secured leverage, maximum unsecured leverage, minimum fixed charge coverage, minimum consolidated tangible net worth, minimum unsecured debt yield, minimum unsecured interest coverage and maximum distributions. Any additional financing we may obtain could contain similar or more restrictive covenants. Our continued ability to incur indebtedness, conduct our operations, and take advantage of business opportunities as they arise is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants. Breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness, in addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments. Any such breach could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. We are subject to particular risks associated with real estate ownership, which could result in unanticipated losses or expenses.. Our business is subject to many risks that are associated with the ownership of real estate. For example, if our operators do not renew their leases, we may be unable to re-lease the facilities at favorable rental rates, if at all. Other risks that are associated with real estate acquisition and ownership include, without limitation, the following:. ·general                                          liability, property and casualty losses, some of which may be uninsured;. ·the                                          inability to purchase or sell our assets rapidly to respond to changing economic conditions,                                          due to the illiquid nature of real estate and the real estate market;. ·leases                                          that are not renewed or are renewed at lower rental amounts at expiration;. 28. ·contingent                                          rent escalators tied to changes in the Consumer Price Index or other parameters;. ·the                                          exercise of purchase options by operators resulting in a reduction of our rental revenue;. ·costs                                          relating to maintenance and repair of our facilities and the need to make expenditures                                          due to changes in governmental regulations, including the Americans with Disabilities                                          Act;. ·environmental                                          hazards created by prior owners or occupants, existing tenants, mortgagors or other persons                                          for which we may be liable; and. ·acts                                          of God or terrorism affecting our properties.. Our real estate investments are relatively illiquid.. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly. The real estate market is affected by many factors which are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and supply and demand. Additional factors that are specific to our industry also tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. For example, all of our properties are ‘‘special purpose’’ properties that cannot be readily converted into general residential, retail or office use. In addition, transfers of operations of nursing homes and other healthcare-related facilities are subject to extensive regulatory approvals. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property, or that we will have funds available to make necessary repairs and improvements to a property held for sale. To the extent we are unable to sell any properties for our book value, we may be required to take a non-cash impairment charge or loss on the sale, either of which would reduce our net income.. As an owner or lender with respect to real property, we may be exposed to possible environmental liabilities.. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner of real property or a secured lender may be liable in certain circumstances for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of, or related releases of, certain hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances, including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or disposal of such substances. As a result, liability may be imposed on the owner in connection with the activities of an operator of the property. The cost of any required investigation, remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and the owner’s liability therefore could exceed the value of the property and/or the assets of the owner. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect an operators’ ability to attract additional residents and our ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which, in turn, could negatively impact our revenues.. Although our leases and mortgage loans generally require the lessee and the mortgagor to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities, the scope of such obligations may be limited. For instance, most of our leases do not require the lessee to indemnify us for environmental liabilities arising before the lessee took possession of the premises. Further, we cannot assure you that any such mortgagor or lessee would be able to fulfill its indemnification obligations to us.. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive. Increasing investor interest in our sector and consolidation at the operator level or REIT level could increase competition and reduce our profitability.. Our business is highly competitive and we expect that it may become more competitive in the future. We compete for healthcare facility investments with other healthcare investors, including other REITs, some of which have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals. If we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline, identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices, or are unable to finance such acquisitions on commercially favorable terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. In addition, if our cost of capital should increase relative to the cost of capital of our competitors, the spread that we realize on our investments may decline if competitive pressures limit or prevent us from charging higher lease or mortgage rates.. 29. We may be named as defendants in litigation arising out of professional liability and general liability claims relating to our previously owned and operated facilities that if decided against us, could adversely affect our financial condition.. We and several of our wholly owned subsidiaries were named as defendants in professional liability and general liability claims related to our owned and operated facilities prior to 2005. Other third-party managers responsible for the day-to-day operations of these facilities were also named as defendants in these claims. In these suits, patients of certain previously owned and operated facilities have alleged significant damages, including punitive damages, against the defendants. Although all of these prior suits have been settled, we or our affiliates could be named as defendants in similar suits in the future. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in our defense of such potential matters or in asserting our claims against various managers of the subject facilities or that the amount of any settlement or judgment would be substantially covered by insurance or that any punitive damages will be covered by insurance.. Our charter and bylaws contain significant anti-takeover provisions which could delay, defer or prevent a change in control or other transactions that could provide our stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common stock.. Our charter and bylaws contain various procedural and other requirements which could make it difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue additional shares of preferred stock and to fix the preferences, rights and limitations of the preferred stock without stockholder approval. In addition, our charter contains limitations on the ownership of our capital stock intended to ensure we continue to meet the requirements for qualification as a REIT. These provisions could discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us, which could adversely affect the market price of our securities and/or result in the delay, deferral or prevention of a change in control or other transactions that could provide our stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common stock.. Our primary assets are the units of partnership interest in Omega OP and, as a result, we will depend on distributions from the Partnership to pay dividends and expenses.. The Company is a holding company and has no material assets other than units of partnership interest in Omega OP. We intend to cause the Partnership to make distributions to its partners, including the Company, in an amount sufficient to allow us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and to pay all of our expenses. To the extent we need funds and the Partnership is restricted from making distributions under applicable law or otherwise, or if the Partnership is otherwise unable to provide such funds, the failure to make such distributions could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.. Members of our management and Board of Directors are holders of units of partnership interest in Omega OP, and their interests may differ from those of our public stockholders.. Some members of our management and Board of Directors are holders of units of partnership interest in Omega OP. Those unitholders may have conflicting interests with holders of the Company’s common stock. For example, such unitholders of Omega OP Units may have different tax positions from the Company or holders of the Company’s common stock, which could influence their decisions in their capacities as members of management regarding whether and when to dispose of assets, whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness and how to structure future transactions.. 30. Ownership of property outside the U.S. may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our U.S. investments.. We have investments in the U.K., and may from time to time may seek to acquire other properties in the U.K. or otherwise outside the U.S. Although we currently have investments in the U.K., we have limited experience investing in healthcare properties or other real estate-related assets located outside the U.S. International development, investment, ownership and operating activities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to our U.S. properties and operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75.0% gross income test or the 95.0% gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT; challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash; changes in foreign political, regulatory, and economic conditions, including regionally, nationally, and locally; challenges in managing international operations; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment and legal proceedings; foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries; diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights in foreign countries; differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing; regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability; and changes in applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. that affect foreign operations. In addition, we have limited investing experience in international markets. If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with international expansion and operations, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.. We may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.. Our ownership of properties in the U.K. currently subjects us to fluctuations in the exchange rates between U.S. dollars and the British pound, which may, from time to time, impact our financial condition and results of operations. If we continue to expand our international presence through investments in, or acquisitions or development of healthcare assets outside the U.S. or the U.K., we may transact business in other foreign currencies. Although we may pursue hedging alternatives, including borrowing in local currencies, to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure you that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.. The vote by the U.K. to leave the European Union could adversely affect us.. The U.K. held a referendum on June 23, 2016 on its membership in the European Union (“E.U.”). A majority of U.K. voters voted to exit the E.U. (“Brexit”), and negotiations will commence to determine the future terms of the U.K.’s relationship with the E.U., including the terms of trade between the U.K. and the E.U. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to E.U. markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial markets. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. Our success depends in part on our ability to retain key personnel and our ability to attract or retain other qualified personnel.. Our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our executive management team and other key employees. The loss of the services of our current executive management team could have an adverse impact on our operations. Although we have entered into employment agreements with the members of our executive management team, these agreements may not assure their continued service. In addition, our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain other qualified personnel. Competition for qualified employees is intense, and we compete for qualified employees with companies with greater financial resources. Our failure to successfully attract, hire, retain and train the people we need would significantly impede our ability to implement our business strategy.. Failure to properly manage and integrate our rapid growth could distract our management or increase our expenses.. We have experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in the future. This growth has resulted in increased levels of responsibility for our management. Future acquisitions or investments could place significant additional demands on, and require us to expand, our management, resources and personnel. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adapt our administrative, accounting and operational systems to integrate and manage the long-term care facilities we have acquired or may acquire in a timely manner. Our failure to manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business and, in particular, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, which could negatively affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders and the trading price of our common stock. Our growth could also increase our capital requirements, which may require us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incur additional debt.. 31. We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, personal identifying information, tenant and lease data. We purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential tenant and other customer information, such as individually identifiable information, including information relating to financial accounts. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.. We are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management’s assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Changes to our business will necessitate ongoing changes to our internal control systems and processes. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements due to inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations and there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price.. Risks Related to Taxation. If we fail to maintain our REIT status, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.. We were organized to qualify for taxation as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. See “Item 1. Business – Taxation.” We believe that we have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code and intend to continue to operate in a manner that will maintain our qualification as a REIT. Qualification as a REIT involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements, some on an annual and some on a quarterly basis, established under highly technical and complex provisions of the Code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involve the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. We cannot assure that we will at all times satisfy these rules and tests.. If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, as a result of a determination that we failed to meet the annual distribution requirement or otherwise, we would be subject to federal income tax, including, with respect to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018, any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates with respect to each such taxable year for which the statute of limitations remains open. Moreover, unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we also would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost. This treatment would significantly reduce our net earnings and cash flow because of our additional tax liability for the years involved, which could significantly impact our financial condition.. 32. We generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our taxable income to our stockholders to maintain our REIT status. To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or do distribute at least 90%, but less than 100% of our “REIT taxable income,” as adjusted, we will be subject to tax thereon at regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates.. Even if we remain qualified as a REIT, we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow.. Even if we remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure, and state or local income, property and transfer taxes. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for the payment of our debt obligations. In addition, to meet REIT qualification requirements, we may hold some of our non-healthcare assets through taxable REIT subsidiaries or other subsidiary corporations that will be subject to corporate level income tax at regular rates.. Prior to the completion of the Aviv Merger, Aviv availed itself of the self-determination provisions and the deficiency dividend procedures under the REIT sections of the Code and supporting Treasury Regulations and IRS pronouncements to remedy certain potential technical violations of the REIT requirements. If there is an adjustment to Aviv’s REIT taxable income or dividends paid deductions as a result of Aviv taking such action, or other determinations by the IRS, the Company could be required to further implement the deficiency dividend procedures in order to maintain Aviv’s REIT status or take other steps to remedy any past non-compliance by Aviv. Any such further implementation of the deficiency dividend procedures could require the Company to make significant distributions to its stockholders and to pay significant penalties and interest to the IRS, which could impair the Company’s ability to expand its business and raise capital, reduce its cash available for distribution to its stockholders and materially adversely affect the value of the Company’s common stock.. Qualifying as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the Code and complying with REIT requirements may affect our profitability.. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of technical and intricate Code provisions. Even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our REIT qualification. To qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the nature and diversification of our assets, the sources of our income and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders. Thus, we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments from our portfolio, or be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us, to satisfy the asset and income tests or to qualify under certain statutory relief provisions. We may also be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution (e.g., if we have assets which generate mismatches between taxable income and available cash). Having to comply with the distribution requirement could cause us to: (i) sell assets in adverse market conditions; (ii) borrow on unfavorable terms; or (iii) distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt. As a result, satisfying the REIT requirements could have an adverse effect on our business results and profitability.. There is a risk of changes in the tax law applicable to REITs.. The IRS, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review U.S. federal income tax legislation, regulations and other guidance. We cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new U.S. federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any legislative action may prospectively or retroactively modify our tax treatment and, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of us, our properties, or our shareholders. In particular, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017, and generally takes effect for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 (subject to certain exceptions). The Tax Act resulted in the broadest rewrite of the Code since 1986 and will have a broad impact across industries and taxpayers, including REITs and their shareholders. These changes will impact us and our shareholders in various ways (as further described below), some of which are adverse or potentially adverse compared to prior law. The IRS has issued limited guidance with respect to the provisions of the Tax Act, and there are numerous interpretive issues that will require guidance. It is likely that technical corrections legislation will be needed to clarify certain aspects of the new law and give proper effect to Congressional intent. There can be no assurance, however, that technical clarifications or changes needed to prevent unintended or unforeseen tax consequences will be enacted by Congress in the near future.. 33. Certain provisions of the Tax Act could require us to increase our distributions to stockholders in order to maintain REIT status or to avoid entity-level taxes.. There are a number of provisions included in the Tax Act that will impact the computation of our taxable income before the deduction for dividends paid to our shareholders (i.e., our undistributed taxable income), which likely will impact, favorably or unfavorably, the amount we will be required to distribute annually as dividends in order to maintain REIT status or avoid an entity-level liability for U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income.. The provisions of the Tax Act likely to have the greatest impact on the computation of our undistributed taxable income are (i) the 30% limitation on the deduction for our interest expense, which limitation may be avoided if we elect to use the alternative depreciation system to depreciate our real property and qualified improvements thereto, ii) the provisions requiring revenue recognition in conformity with the Company’s applicable financial statements, (iii) the provisions allowing for full expensing of qualified property placed in service prior to 2022 (this deduction is reduced by 20% per year beginning in 2023), and (iv) limitations imposed on the deductibility of performance-based compensation paid to the principal executive and financial officers, and our next three (3) highest compensated officers. Other provisions that could have a lesser impact on our undistributed taxable income include, for example, additional limitations on the deductions for certain travel and entertainment expenses and lobbying expenses before local governmental bodies.. To the extent that the deductibility of certain of our expenses is limited or the acceleration of revenue recognition is required by the Tax Act (as discussed above), there would be an increase in the amount we are required to distribute annually to our shareholders to avoid entity-level taxation but would not result in any corresponding increase in our cash available for distribution as dividends. On the other hand, depending on the manner in which the acquisition of property is financed, the full expensing rules could have the opposite impact – i.e., decreasing the amount we are required to distribute annually without any corresponding decrease in our cash available for distribution as dividends.. The ultimate impact of the Tax Act may differ from our description herein due to changes in interpretations, as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued. Investors are strongly urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential impact of the Tax Act on the U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to investors based on their particular circumstances.. 34. Risks Related to Our Stock. In addition to the risks related to our operators and our operations described above, the following are additional risks associated with our stock.. The market value of our stock could be substantially affected by various factors.. Market volatility may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As with other publicly traded securities, the share price of our stock depends on many factors, which may change from time to time, including:. ·the market for similar securities issued by REITs;. ·changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us, our competitors or our industry;. ·our ability to meet analysts’ estimates;. ·prevailing interest rates;. ·our credit rating;. ·changes in legal and regulatory taxation obligations;. ·litigation and regulatory proceedings;. ·general economic and market conditions; and. ·the financial condition, performance and prospects of us, our tenants and our competitors.. 35. Our issuance of additional capital stock, warrants or debt securities, whether or not convertible, may reduce the market price for our outstanding securities, including our common stock, and dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders.. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of our capital stock, warrants or debt securities, or the availability of our securities for future sale, will have on the market price of our securities, including our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or preferred shares, warrants or debt securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could negatively impact the market price of our stock and the terms upon which we may obtain additional equity financing in the future. Our Board of Directors has the authority to designate and issue preferred stock that may have dividend, liquidation and other rights that are senior to those of our common stock.. In addition, we may issue additional capital stock in the future to raise capital or as a result of the following:. ·the                                          issuance and exercise of options to purchase our common stock or other equity awards                                          under remuneration plans (we may also issue equity to our employees in lieu of cash bonuses                                          or to our directors in lieu of director’s fees);. ·the                                          issuance of shares pursuant to our dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan                                          or at-the-market offerings;. ·the                                          issuance of debt securities exchangeable for our common stock;. ·the                                          exercise of warrants we may issue in the future;. ·the                                          issuance of warrants or other rights to acquire shares to current or future lenders in                                          connection with providing financing; and. ·the                                          sales of securities convertible into our common stock.. Any debt securities, preferred shares, warrants or other rights to acquire shares or convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution. Our preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments that could limit our ability pay dividends or other distributions to the holders of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk that our future offerings could reduce the per share trading price of our common stock and dilute their interest in us.. 36. Your ownership percentage in our company may be diluted in the future.. In the future, your percentage ownership in us may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise. We also anticipate that we will grant future compensatory equity-based incentive awards to directors, officers and employees who provide services to us. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.. In addition, our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the occurrence of specified events, or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to shares of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.. There are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future.. Our ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected upon the occurrence of any of the risks described herein. Our payment of dividends is subject to compliance with restrictions contained in our credit agreements, the indentures governing our senior notes and any preferred stock that our Board of Directors may from time to time designate and authorize for issuance. All dividends will be paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our earnings, our financial condition, maintenance of our REIT status and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. There are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future. In addition, our dividends in the past have included, and may in the future include, a return of capital.. A downgrade of our credit rating could impair our ability to obtain additional debt financing on favorable terms, if at all, and significantly reduce the trading price of our common stock.. If any rating agency downgrades our credit rating, or places our rating under watch or review for possible downgrade, then it may be more difficult or expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing, and the trading price of our common stock may decline. Factors that may affect our credit rating include, among other things, our financial performance, our success in raising sufficient equity capital, adverse changes in our debt and fixed charge coverage ratios, our capital structure and level of indebtedness and pending or future changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our operators and our industry. We cannot assure that these credit agencies will not downgrade our credit rating in the future."
