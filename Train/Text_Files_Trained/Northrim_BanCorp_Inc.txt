[1] "ITEM 1A.            RISK FACTORS. An investment in the Company's common stock is subject to risks inherent to the Company's business.  The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company are described below.  Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report.  The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company.  Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company's business operations.  This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.. 11. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company's financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of the Company's common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.. Current economic conditions in the State of Alaska pose significant challenges for us and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. We are operating in an uncertain economic environment. The decrease in the price of oil from 2014 through 2016 has led to a significant deficit in the budget for the State of Alaska, and we believe that absent action by the Alaska state legislature, these deficits are expected to exhaust cash savings of the state within approximately a year. In the longer term, relatively low oil prices are expected to negatively impact the overall economy in Alaska on a larger scale as we estimate that one third of the Alaskan economy is related to oil. Financial institutions continue to be affected by changing conditions in the real estate and financial markets, along with an arduous regulatory climate. Dramatic declines in the United States housing market from 2008 through 2012, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment, resulted in significant writedowns of asset values by financial institutions. While conditions have improved nationally, a return to a recessionary economy could result in financial stress on our borrowers that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Deteriorating conditions in the regional economies of Anchorage, Matanuska-Susitna Valley, Fairbanks, and the Southeast areas of Alaska served by the Company could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses. We may also face the following risks in connection with events:. <U+25AA> Ineffective monetary policy could cause rapid changes in interest rates and asset values that would have a materially adverse impact on our profitability and overall financial condition. <U+25AA> Market developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, resulting in increased delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities. <U+25AA> Regulatory scrutiny of the industry could increase, leading to harsh regulation of our industry that could lead to a higher cost of compliance, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities and increase our exposure to the judicial system and the plaintiff's bar. <U+25AA> Erosion in the fiscal condition of the U.S. Treasury could lead to new taxes that would limit the ability of the Company to pursue growth and return profits to shareholders.. If these conditions or similar ones develop, we could experience adverse effects on our financial condition.. Our concentration of operations in the Anchorage, Matanuska-Susitna Valley, Fairbanks and Southeast areas of Alaska makes us more sensitive to downturns in those areas.. Substantially all of our business is derived from the Anchorage, Matanuska-Susitna Valley, Fairbanks, and Southeast areas of Alaska.  The majority of our lending has been with Alaska businesses and individuals.   At December 31, 2017, approximately 71% of the Bank's loans are secured by real estate and 3% are unsecured. Approximately 26% are for general commercial uses, including professional, retail, and small businesses, and are secured by non-real estate assets.  Repayment is expected from the borrowers' cash flow or, secondarily, the collateral.   Our exposure to credit loss, if any, is the outstanding amount of the loan if the collateral is proved to be of no value.  These areas rely primarily upon the natural resources industries, particularly oil production, as well as tourism and government and U.S. military spending for their economic success.  In particular, the oil industry plays a significant role in the Alaskan economy.  We believe that the dramatic decline in the global price of oil from 2014 through 2016 poses a significant risk for the Alaskan economy which is heavily dependent on the petroleum industry and if the global price of oil continues to remain at the current relatively low level, the Alaskan economy would likely be adversely affected. We estimate that one third of Alaska's gross state product is currently derived from the oil industry.. Our business is and will remain sensitive to economic factors that relate to these industries and local and regional business conditions.  As a result, local or regional economic downturns, or downturns that disproportionately affect one or more of the key industries in regions served by the Company, may have a more pronounced effect upon our business than they might on an institution that is less geographically concentrated.  The extent of the future impact of these events on economic and business conditions cannot be predicted; however, prolonged or acute fluctuations could have a material and adverse impact upon our results of operation and financial condition.. Changes in market interest rates could adversely impact the Company.. Our earnings are impacted by changing interest rates.  Changes in interest rates affect the demand for new loans, the credit profile of existing loans, the rates received on loans and securities, and rates paid on deposits and borrowings.  These impacts. 12. may negatively impact our ability to attract deposits, make loans, and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. In particular, increases in interest rates will likely reduce RML's revenues by further reducing the market for refinancings, as well as the demand for RML's other residential loan products.  Additionally, increases in interest rates may impact our borrowers' ability to make loan payments, particularly in our commercial  loan portfolio.. Interest rates may be affected by many factors beyond our control, including general and economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. Market volatility in interest rates can be difficult to predict, as unexpected interest rate changes may result in a sudden impact while anticipated changes in interest rates generally impact the mortgage rate market prior to the actual rate change.  Exposure to interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the repricing frequency of our rate-sensitive assets and rate-sensitive liabilities over any given period.  Although we believe the current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable, significant fluctuations in interest rates could potentially have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We operate in a highly regulated environment and changes of or increases in banking or other laws and regulations or governmental fiscal or monetary policies could adversely affect us.. We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities.  In addition, as a publicly-traded company, we are subject to regulation by the SEC and NASDAQ.  Any change in applicable regulations or federal or state legislation or in policies or interpretations or regulatory approaches to compliance and enforcement, income tax laws and accounting principles could have a substantial impact on us and our operations.  Changes in laws and regulations may also increase our expenses by imposing additional fees or taxes or restrictions on our operations.  Additional legislation and regulations that could significantly affect our authority and operations may be enacted or adopted in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  Failure to appropriately comply with any such laws, regulations or principles could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies or damage to our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.. In that regard, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted in July 2010.  Among other provisions, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to regulate consumer financial products such as credit cards and mortgages, created a Financial Stability Oversight Council comprised of the heads of other regulatory agencies, has resulted in new capital requirements from federal banking agencies, placed new limits on electronic debt card interchange fees, and requires banking regulators, the SEC and national stock exchanges to adopt significant new corporate governance and executive compensation reforms.. Certain provisions of these new rules have phase-in periods, including a 2.5% conservation buffer, which began to be phased-in in 2016 and is scheduled to take full effect on January 1, 2019.  Further, regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy practices that they deem to be unsafe or unsound, or violations of laws or regulations by financial institutions and holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties.  These powers have been utilized more frequently in recent years due to the serious national economic conditions that faced the financial system in late 2008 and early 2009.  The exercise of regulatory authority may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, our business is affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. federal government and its agencies, including the FRB.. We cannot accurately predict the full effects of recent or future legislation or the various other governmental, regulatory, monetary and fiscal initiatives which have been and may be enacted on the financial markets and on the Company.  The terms and costs of these activities could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.. We are subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements which may adversely affect our net income and future growth.. In July 2013, the FRB and the FDIC announced the new capital rules, which apply to both depository institutions and (subject to certain exceptions not applicable to the Company) their holding companies.  As described in further detail above in \"Item 1 Business - Supervision and Regulation\" these rules created increased capital requirements for United States depository institutions and their holding companies. These rules include risk-based and leverage capital ratio requirements, which became effective on January 1, 2015. These rules also revise the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions, including the Bank, if their capital levels do not meet certain thresholds. These revisions also became effective January 1, 2015.. 13. Our failure to comply with the minimum capital requirements could result in our regulators taking formal or informal actions against us which could restrict our future growth or operations.. The operations of our business, including our interaction with customers, are increasingly done via electronic means, and this has increased our risks related to cybersecurity.. The Company is exposed to cyber-attacks in the normal course of business.  In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events.  We have observed an increased level of attention focused on cyber-attacks that include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption.  Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as by causing denial-of-service attacks on websites.  Cyber-attacks may be carried out by third parties or insiders using techniques that range from highly sophisticated efforts to electronically circumvent network security or overwhelm websites to more traditional intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information necessary to gain access.  The objectives of cyber-attacks vary widely and may include theft of financial assets, intellectual property, or other sensitive information belonging to the Company or our customers.  Cyber-attacks may also be directed at disrupting the operations of the Company's business.. While the Company has not incurred any material losses related to cyber-attacks, nor are we aware of any specific or threatened cyber-incidents as of the date of this report, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences if we fall victim to successful cyber-attacks.  Such negative consequences could include remediation costs that may include liability for stolen assets or information and repairing system damage that may have been caused; increased cybersecurity protection costs that may include organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees and engaging third party experts and consultants; lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack; litigation; and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence.. The network and computer systems on which we depend could fail.. Our computer systems could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Because we conduct a part of our business over the Internet and outsource several critical functions to third parties, operations will depend on our ability, as well as the ability of third party service providers, to protect computer systems and network infrastructure against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, physical break-ins or similar catastrophic events. Any damage or failure that causes interruptions in operations may compromise our ability to perform critical functions in a timely manner and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations as well as our reputation and customer or vendor relationships.. Our business is highly reliant on third party vendors and our ability to manage the operational risks associated with outsourcing those services.. We rely on third parties to provide services that are integral to our operations. These vendors provide services that support our operations, including the storage and processing of sensitive consumer and business customer data. The loss of these vendor relationships, or a failure of these vendors' systems, could disrupt the services we provide to our customers and cause us to incur significant expense in connection with replacing these services. Further, a cyber security breach of a vendor's system may result in theft of our data or disruption of business processes.  A material breach of customer data security at a service provider's site may negatively impact our business reputation and cause a loss of customers; result in increased expense to contain the event and/or require that we provide credit monitoring services for affected customers, result in regulatory fines and sanctions and/or result in litigation.  In most cases, we will remain primarily liable to our customers for losses arising from a breach of a vendor's data security system. We rely on our outsourced service providers to implement and maintain prudent cyber security controls.  We have procedures in place to assess a vendor's cyber security controls prior to establishing a contractual relationship and to periodically review assessments of those control systems; however, these procedures are not infallible and a vendor's system can be breached despite the procedures we employ.. We continually encounter technological change, and we may have fewer resources than many of our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements.. The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many national vendors provide turn-key services to community banks, such as Internet banking. 14. and remote deposit capture that allow smaller banks to compete with institutions that have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able, however, to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers.. Residential mortgage lending is a market sector that experiences significant volatility and is influenced by many factors  beyond our control.. The Company earns revenue from the residential mortgage lending activities primarily in the form of gains on the sale of mortgage loans that we originate and sell to the secondary market.  Residential mortgage lending in general has experienced substantial volatility in recent periods primarily due to changes in interest rates and other market forces beyond our control. Interest rate changes, such as rate increases implemented by the FRB, may result in lower rate locks and closed loan volume, which may adversely impact the earnings and results of operations of RML. In addition, an increase in interest rates may materially and adversely affect our future loan origination volume and margins.. If we do not comply with the agreements governing servicing of loans or if others allege non-compliance, our business and results of operations may be harmed.. We have contractual obligations under the servicing agreements pursuant to which we service mortgage loans. Many of our servicing agreements require adherence to general servicing standards, and certain contractual provisions delegate judgment over various servicing matters to us. Our servicing practices, and the judgments that we make in our servicing of loans, could be questioned by parties to these agreements. We could also become subject to litigation claims seeking damages or other remedies arising from alleged breaches of our servicing agreements.. Additionally, under our loan servicing program we retain servicing rights on mortgage loans originated by RML and sold to the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation. If we breach any of the representations and warranties in our servicing agreements with the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation, we may be required to repurchase any loan sold under this program and record a loss upon repurchase and/or bear any subsequent loss on the loan. We may not have any remedies available to us against third parties for such losses, or the remedies might not be as broad as the remedies available to the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation against us.. Our loan loss allowance may not be adequate to cover future loan losses, which may adversely affect our earnings.. We have established a reserve for probable losses we expect to incur in connection with loans in our credit portfolio. This allowance reflects our estimate of the collectability of certain identified loans, as well as an overall risk assessment of total loans outstanding.  Our determination of the amount of loan loss allowance is highly subjective; although management personnel apply criteria such as risk ratings and historical loss rates; these factors may not be adequate predictors of future loan performance.  Accordingly, we cannot offer assurances that these estimates ultimately will prove correct or that the loan loss allowance will be sufficient to protect against losses that ultimately may occur.  If our loan loss allowance proves to be inadequate, we may suffer unexpected charges to income, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.  Moreover, bank regulators frequently monitor banks' loan loss allowances, and if regulators were to determine that the allowance is inadequate, they may require us to increase the allowance, which also would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.. We have a significant concentration in real estate lending. A downturn in real estate within our markets would have a negative impact on our results of operations.. Approximately 71% of the Bank's loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 consisted of loans secured by commercial and residential real estate located in Alaska. Additionally, all of the Company's loans held for sale are secured by residential real estate. A slowdown in the residential sales cycle in our major markets and a constriction in the availability of mortgage financing, such as what occurred during the financial crisis in the United States housing market from 2008 through 2012, would negatively impacted residential real estate sales, which would result in customers' inability to repay loans.  This would result in an increase in our non-performing assets if more borrowers fail to perform according to loan terms and if we take possession of real estate properties. Additionally, if real estate values decline, the value of real estate collateral securing our loans could be significantly reduced.  If any of these effects continue or become more pronounced, loan losses will increase more than we expect and our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely impacted.. Further, approximately 51% of the Bank's loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 consisted of commercial real estate loans.   While our investments in these types of loans have not been as adversely impacted as residential construction and land development loans, there can be no assurance that the credit quality in these portfolios will remain stable.  Commercial construction. 15. and commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers.  Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one commercial loan or one credit relationship exposes us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a consumer loan.  The credit quality of these loans may deteriorate more than expected which may result in losses that exceed the estimates that are currently included in our loan loss allowance, which could adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations.. Real estate values may decrease leading to additional and greater than anticipated loan charge-offs and valuation writedowns on our other real estate owned (\"OREO\") properties.. Real estate owned by the Bank and not used in the ordinary course of its operations is referred to as \"other real estate owned\" or \"OREO\" property.  We foreclose on and take title to the real estate serving as collateral for defaulted loans as part of our business.  At December 31, 2017, the Bank held $8.7 million of OREO properties, most of which relate to a commercial real estate loan.   Increased OREO balances lead to greater expenses as we incur costs to manage and dispose of the properties.  Our ability to sell OREO properties is affected by public perception that banks are inclined to accept large discounts from market value in order to quickly liquidate properties.  Any decrease in market prices may lead to OREO writedowns, with a corresponding expense in our income statement.  We evaluate OREO property values periodically and writedown the carrying value of the properties if the results of our evaluations require it.  Further writedowns on OREO or an inability to sell OREO properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.. Changes in the FRB's monetary or fiscal policies could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.. Our earnings will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The FRB has, and is likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of depository institutions through its power to implement national monetary policy, among other things, in order to curb inflation or combat a recession. The FRB affects the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its control over the issuance of United States government securities, its regulation of the discount rate applicable to member banks and its influence over reserve requirements to which member banks are subject. We cannot predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.. We conduct substantially all of our operations through Northrim Bank, our banking subsidiary; our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our shares, or to repay our indebtedness depends upon liquid assets held by the holding company and the results of operations of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends.. The Company is a separate legal entity from our subsidiaries.  It receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends paid from the Bank.  There are legal limitations on the extent to which the Bank may extend credit, pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to, or engage in transactions with us.  Our inability to receive dividends from the Bank could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.. Our net income depends primarily upon the Bank's net interest income, which is the income that remains after deducting from total income generated by earning assets the expense attributable to the acquisition of the funds required to support earning assets (primarily interest paid on deposits and borrowings).  The amount of interest income is dependent on many factors including the volume of earning assets, the general level of interest rates, the dynamics of changes in interest rates and the levels of nonperforming loans.  All of those factors affect the Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Company. In 2016, a requirement to have a capital conservation buffer started to be phased in and this requirement, which is scheduled to come into full effect on January 1, 2019 could adversely affect the Bank's ability to pay dividends.. Various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends the Bank can pay to us without regulatory approval.  Under Alaska law, a bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its net undivided profits then on hand. In addition, the Bank may not pay cash dividends if that payment could reduce the amount of its capital below that necessary to meet the \"adequately capitalized\" level in accordance with regulatory capital requirements.  It is also possible that, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, regulatory authorities could conclude that payment of dividends or other payments, including payments to us, is an unsafe or unsound practice and impose restrictions or prohibit such payments.   It is the policy of the FRB that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of net income available over the past year and only if prospective rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organization's current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.  The policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines a bank holding company's ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries.. 16. The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.. Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure. There can be no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.. The financial services business is intensely competitive and our success will depend on our ability to compete effectively.. The financial services business in our market areas is highly competitive.  It is becoming increasingly competitive due to changes in regulation, technological advances, and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers.  We face competition both in attracting deposits and in originating loans. We compete for loans principally through the pricing of interest rates and loan fees and the efficiency and quality of services.  Increasing levels of competition in the banking and financial services industries may reduce our market share or cause the prices charged for our services to fall.   Improvements in technology, communications, and the internet have intensified competition. As a result, our competitive position could be weakened, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. We are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so could materially adversely affect our performance.. We are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of our employees or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.. We may be unable to attract and retain key employees and personnel.. We will be dependent for the foreseeable future on the services of Joseph M. Schierhorn, our Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Operating Officer of the Company;  Michael Martin, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary; and Jed W. Ballard, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  While we maintain keyman life insurance on the lives of Messrs. Schierhorn and Martin in the amounts of $2 million each, we may not be able to timely replace Mr. Schierhorn or Mr. Martin with a person of comparable ability and experience should the need to do so arise, causing losses in excess of the insurance proceeds.  The unexpected loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and possibly result in reduced revenues and earnings.. Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial conditions.. Liquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity and severely constrain our financial flexibility. Our primary source of funding is deposits gathered through our network of branch offices. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or the economy in general. Factors that could negatively impact our access to liquidity sources include:. • a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of an economic downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated;. • adverse regulatory actions against us; or. • our inability to attract and retain deposits.. Our ability to borrow could be impaired by factors that are not specific to us or our region, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry and unstable credit markets.. 17. A failure of a significant number of our borrowers, guarantors and related parties to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans would have an adverse impact on our results of operations.. A source of risk arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained if a significant number of our borrowers, guarantors and related parties fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans.  We have adopted underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies, including the establishment and review of our allowance for loan losses, which we believe are appropriate to minimize this risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance, tracking loan performance, and diversifying our credit portfolio.  These policies and procedures, however, may not prevent unexpected losses that could materially affect our results of operations.. Non-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Truth-in-Lending Act or other laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions or other adverse consequences.. Financial institutions are required under the USA PATRIOT Act and Bank Secrecy Act to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money-laundering and terrorist activities. Financial institutions are also obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the United States Treasury Department's Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network if such activities are detected. These rules also require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure or the inability to comply with these regulations could result in fines or penalties, intervention or sanctions by regulators, and costly litigation or expensive additional controls and systems. In recent years, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. In addition, the federal government has in place laws and regulations relating to residential and consumer lending, as well as other activities with customers, that create significant compliance burdens and financial risks. We have developed policies and continue to augment procedures and systems designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations; however, it is possible for such safeguards to fail or prove deficient during the implementation phase to avoid non-compliance with such laws."
