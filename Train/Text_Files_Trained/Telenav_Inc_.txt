[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous uncertainties and risks. The following risks and uncertainties may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. You should consider these risks and uncertainties carefully, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. If any of the risks or uncertainties we face were to occur, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.. Risk related to our business. We incurred losses in each period since fiscal 2015. We expect that we will incur losses during fiscal 2019 and we do not know when, or if, we will return to profitability, as we make further expenditures to enhance and expand our operations in order to support growth and diversification of our business.. As a percentage of revenue, our net loss was 84%, 28% and 19% in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our revenue from paid wireless carrier mobile navigation has substantially declined and we expect it to continue to do so and we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue from our automobile navigation and advertising businesses to return Telenav to profitability in the short-term, if at all. In January 2018, the terms of our contract with Ford changed to include expanded services, a longer term and future milestone deliveries. These changes resulted in a significant deferral of revenue, reduction of revenue recognized and an increase in losses incurred in fiscal 2018.. We anticipate that we will continue to incur net operating losses during fiscal 2019. These expected losses are also due to the expected continued decline in our higher margin mobile navigation revenue and the costs we expect to incur prior to generating revenue in connection with new automotive navigation products and services that will not be integrated into production vehicles for several years, if at all. The time required to develop, test and deploy products between the time we secure the award of a new contract with any automobile manufacturer or tier one, and the timing of revenue thereunder, as well as a substantial required upfront investment in research and development resources prior to entering into contracts with automobile manufacturers and tier ones contribute to these expected losses. We also expect to continue to experience pressure on pricing in our negotiations with automobile manufacturers and tier ones as we enter into negotiations for contract renewals or new products where we are competing with larger suppliers that are competing on price, rather than features, or for vehicles where customers are price sensitive regarding navigation solutions or where the automobile manufacturer is considering brought-in solutions such as Apple CarPlay or Google's Android Auto.. Although we are working to replace the continued decline in wireless carrier revenue, our efforts to develop new services and products and attract new customers require investments in anticipation of longer term revenue. For example, the design cycle for automotive navigation products and services is typically 18 to 24 months and in order to win designs and achieve revenue from this growth area, we typically have to make investments two to four years before we anticipate receiving revenue, if any. This is the case for our relationship with GM. In addition, the revenue commencement at initial launch may not be significant depending on the automobile manufacturer's or tier one's launch timing schedule across vehicle models and regions. For example, although our hybrid product with GM launched in February 2017, it has only launched in select vehicle models and we do not have any control over when and whether it launches in other GM models.. Once we are able to recognize revenue from new automotive products, we may be required to recognize that revenue over time if there are contractual service periods or other obligations to fulfill, such as specified contractual deliverables. Certain contractual service periods or other obligations currently extend up to ten years. We intend to make additional investments in systems and continue to expand our operations to support diversification of our business, but it is likely that these efforts at diversification will not replace our declining wireless carrier revenue in the short-term, if at all. As a result of these factors, we believe we will incur a net operating loss and we will incur net losses during fiscal 2019, and we cannot predict when, or if, we will return to profitability. Our investments and expenditures may not result in the growth that we anticipate.. Our quarterly revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.. Our quarterly revenue and operating results may vary significantly in the future. Therefore, you should not rely on the results achieved in any one quarter as an indication of future performance. Period to period comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful. Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, those listed below, many of which are outside of our control:. • the ability of automobile manufacturers to sell automobiles equipped with our products;. 13. Table of Contents. • competitive in-car platforms and products, such as Apple's CarPlay and Google's auto initiatives;. • the recent decision by Toyota to expand Apple's CarPlay compatibility to certain of its 2019 model year and beyond Toyota and Lexus vehicles;. • the recent announcement by Ford of its intentions to modify its North America, and potentially European, passenger car portfolio;. • the seasonality and unpredictability of new vehicle production, including tooling and assembly changes and plant shutdowns, such as the potential impact to production of certain Ford pickup truck models in U.S. factories due to a May 2018 fire at a supplier plant;. • changes made to existing contractual obligations with a customer that may affect the nature and timing of revenue recognition, such as the transition by Ford to its SYNC 3 platform, for which we have different revenue recognition criteria, or the adoption of our map update solution for Ford's customers in multiple geographies and its impact on the timing of our revenue recognition;. • competitive pressures on automotive navigation pricing from low cost suppliers and for vehicles where consumers are extremely price sensitive;. • the recent demonstration by Google of in-car integration of Android Auto with Google Maps which did not require a mobile handset;. • investments made by HERE and TomTom in high definition maps that may be leveraged to displace our products and services in new vehicle models;. • the seasonality of new vehicle model introductions and consumer buying patterns, as well as the effects of economic uncertainty on vehicle purchases, particularly outside of the United States;. • the impact on vehicle sales resulting from tariffs on imported vehicles and parts and disruption to automobile manufacturer supply chains resulting therefrom;. • the effectiveness of our entry into new business areas;. • the loss of our relationship, a change in our revenue model, or a change in pricing with any particular customer;. • poor reviews of automotive service offerings into which our navigation solutions are integrated resulting in limited uptake of navigation options by car buyers;. • warranty claims based on the performance of our products and the potential impact on our reputation with navigation users, automobile manufacturers and tier ones;. • the sale of vehicle brands by automobile manufacturers to an automobile manufacturer with which we do not have an existing relationship;. • the timing and quality of information we receive from our customers and the impact of customer audits of their reporting to us;. • the inability of our automobile manufacturer customers to attract new vehicle buyers and new subscribers for connected services;. • the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our operations and infrastructure through acquisitions or organic growth;. • the timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies, products or businesses;. • the cost and potential outcomes of existing and future litigation;. • the timing and success of new product or service introductions by us or our competitors and customer reviews of those products or services;. • the timing and success of marketing expenditures for our products and services;. • the extent of any interruption in our services;. 14. Table of Contents. • potential foreign currency exchange gains and losses associated with expenses and sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar;. • general economic, industry and market conditions that impact expenditures for new vehicles, smartphones and mobile location services in the United States and other countries where we sell our services and products;. • changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact our return on our investments in cash and marketable securities;. • changes in our effective tax rates; and. • the impact of new accounting pronouncements such as ASC 606.. Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results might lead analysts and investors to change their models for valuing our common stock. As a result, our stock price could decline rapidly and we could face costly securities class action lawsuits or other unanticipated issues.. We are dependent on Ford for a substantial portion of our billings and revenue, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed if our billings and revenue from Ford do not continue to grow or decline.. Ford represented approximately 55%, 69% and 71% of our revenue in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In fact, during the six months ended June 30, 2018, we experienced a decline in revenue due primarily to a change in revenue recognition discussed below, and a decline in billings due primarily to a reduction in certain content costs that are passed through to Ford. We expect that Ford, other automobile manufacturers and tier ones will account for an increasing portion of our revenue and billings, as our revenue and billings from paid wireless carrier provided navigation continues to decline. However, our revenue and billings could potentially decline if Ford increases the cost to consumers of our navigation product, reduces the number of vehicles or the geographies in which vehicles with our product as an option are sold, or its sales of vehicles fall below forecast due to competition or global macro-economic conditions. Ford previously announced that it would open its SYNC 3 product to Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto and recently announced that Waze will be available on its vehicles equipped with the SYNC 3 platform, which may reduce the number of vehicle purchasers who purchase built-in navigation services. We may not successfully increase our revenue and billings from Ford if our products are replaced within vehicles by Ford with our competitors' products or from price competition from third parties. Moreover, Ford has announced its intention to modify its North American passenger car portfolio strategy and recently indicated that it is also considering changes in its European portfolio strategy. This could lead to a significant reduction in the sales of vehicles with our products as an option. We may not be able to mitigate the effect of any lost billings and revenue and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected, our stock price could be volatile, and it may be difficult for us to achieve and maintain profitability.. Our contract with Ford covers a broad range of products and services that we provide to Ford.  On December 14, 2017, Ford awarded to Telenav a further extension of the Ford Agreement, to December 31, 2020 for each jurisdiction in which we currently provide our products to Ford, subject to certain conditions and execution of a subsequent amendment to the Ford Agreement. The subsequent amendment was executed in March 2018.  On December 14, 2017, Ford also selected us to provide its next generation navigation solution in North America, subject to certain conditions and execution of an agreement regarding those solutions.  Although we have been awarded these programs, in the course of negotiating definitive agreements for the programs, the terms and conditions of the programs, including the pricing, the length of the programs and geographic scope of the programs, may change. We were not awarded the contracts for Europe, South America and Australia and New Zealand.. In addition, a substantial portion of our revenue and billings and, to a lesser extent, gross profit from Ford is impacted by the underlying licensed content cost negotiated through HERE and other content providers.  We cannot predict the impact on our revenue, billings, and gross profit of any changes between the automobile manufacturers and the map or other content providers.. We have limited experience managing, supporting and retaining automobile manufacturers and tier ones as customers and if we are not able to maintain Ford as a customer our revenue will decline.. Our automotive revenue and earnings could fluctuate due to the complexities of revenue recognition and capitalization of expenses related to customized products.. Due to the complexities of revenue recognition in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, when and if we generate revenue we may be required to recognize certain revenue over extended periods. For example, GAAP requires us to defer revenue and recognize that revenue over the term of the connected services or contractual obligation. 15. Table of Contents. for our contractual arrangements with GM for its OnStar RemoteLink and associated MyBrand applications, Ford for vehicles produced in the jurisdictions where we provide SYNC 3 services for their respective map update programs (and with respect to SYNC 2, Australia and New Zealand), and Toyota for its Entune Audio and Lexus Enform equipped vehicles.. Because we entered into an agreement with Ford to provide our map update solution in conjunction with our on-board navigation product for Europe in the second half of fiscal 2017, certain revenue related to the on-board navigation product in this region, which we had been recognizing upon delivery, is now recognized over time along with the new map updates.  Offering map updates in this jurisdiction resulted in a substantial decline in our revenue and a substantial increase in our deferred revenue and deferred cost balances. Revenue recognition was further impacted by a recent amendment of our agreement with Ford. The scope of our solution with Ford has expanded to include future milestone deliveries throughout calendar 2018 and beyond. As a result, under current GAAP, all prospective royalties related to Ford since January 1, 2018 have been recorded as deferred revenue until such milestone deliveries occur and are accepted by Ford.. We anticipate that these changes in revenue recognition will be mitigated to an extent when we adopt ASC 606 on July 1, 2018.  Although we anticipate that the adoption of ASC 606 will result in recognition of revenue and associated content costs more closely aligned with the economic reality of our business, we will not be able to recognize a significant portion of the deferred revenue (or deferred costs) on our balance sheet as of June 30, 2018 in future periods. Rather, under ASC 606 these amounts will be restated and reflected as revenue in prior periods, with the net impact recorded to retained earnings as of July 1, 2018.. Revenue recognition could also be impacted by future amendments to tier one agreements, such as providing our map update solution in other regions, changes in procurement patterns, shipping terms and title transfer. For on-board automotive navigation, we recognize revenue as the related customized software is delivered to and accepted by our customers. As our solutions encompass greater value-added services, there is potential for changes in the timing of revenue recognition. Investors and securities analysts may not understand the subtleties of these revenue recognition requirements and the trading prices of our common stock may be negatively affected.. In addition, our revenue recognition is becoming increasingly more complex with the evolution of our value-added products and services, such as our hybrid navigation solutions. The agreements for these solutions can extend over several years and require multiple deliverables.  Given the length of our contractual obligations, which often extend beyond the manufacture and sale of the vehicle when the royalty is determined and paid, we may have significant post-production obligations to provide on-board navigation services or map updates over an extended period of time. These extended obligations can result in a delay in recognition of revenue, or the need to defer and recognize revenue over the period that we are required to provide these post-production obligations or other services.. In conjunction with the adoption of ASC606, we have not concluded on the application of ASC 340-40 with respect to the accounting treatment regarding the timing of capitalization and recognition of development costs that are incurred to fulfill obligations under certain actual or anticipated contracts for on-board automotive solutions. In the event we conclude that we are required to capitalize these costs that we expect to recover, we will recognize them as we transfer control of the related performance obligation. Development costs subject to ASC 340-40 incurred to fulfill future obligations under certain actual or anticipated contracts for brought-in automotive solutions are expected to be capitalized and then amortized over the period the services obligation is expected to be fulfilled.. Should we determine that we are required to capitalize certain development costs for on-board automotive solutions as deferred development costs under ASC 340-40 rather than expense them, our cost of revenue, research and development expenses and operating results could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis.. We may also incur significant expense to develop products for automobile manufacturers, such as under our worldwide connected navigation services agreement with GM, prior to receiving any significant revenue related to the sale of vehicles with our navigation services. As our offerings in automotive navigation expand to brought-in, as well as on-board navigation, we may not correctly anticipate the financial accounting treatment for the various products. We could be required to amortize revenue from products over time although we previously recognized revenue for similar products when the applicable vehicle was sold.. We may not be successful at adapting our business model for the Chinese automotive navigation market, which may reduce our revenue per vehicle.. Expanding our initial automotive entry in the Chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. The automotive software market in China is highly competitive. This competition comes from large international automotive software providers as well as domestic providers. The Chinese navigation software market is seeing transition towards new business models by third party navigation product vendors, such as substantially lower per unit license fees that are intended to. 16. Table of Contents. be offset by opportunities to monetize navigation usage in additional ways that may include, but not be limited to, advertising, usage based insurance and utilizing data to create high definition maps. We may need to change or modify our license fee model in China in order to compete effectively. Our inability to do so may have a material impact on our ability to expand into the Chinese market.  Even if we adopt new license fee models for China-based automobile manufacturers, we may not recognize revenue from those new models sufficient to compensate us for the costs of supporting those automobile manufacturers in the short-term, if at all.  In addition, many of the same business model, pricing and licensing changes could also impact us in additional markets including, but not limited to, North America and Europe.. We may not be successful in generating material revenue from automobile manufacturers and tier ones other than Ford. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed if we are unable to diversify our automotive revenue.. Although we have attempted to mitigate our dependence on Ford by establishing relationships with other automobile manufacturers and tier ones, these relationships may not produce significant revenue if the products are launched in limited models or face competition from third parties. Even if we are able to diversify our automotive navigation business through new arrangements, such as our more recently established relationships with GM and Toyota, customers may not elect to purchase automobile manufacturer and tier one navigation offerings that include our software and/or services for reasons unrelated to performance of our software or services. Even if we win new awards, once those programs go into production, consumers may not widely adopt our navigation offerings or may criticize the performance or quality of the navigation software and our reputation may be harmed.  If customer purchase rates are less than anticipated, we may be unable to effectively diversify our automotive navigation revenue and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.. We may be unable to enter into agreements to provide automotive navigation products if we do not offer navigation products that serve geographies throughout the world or automobile manufacturers and tier ones are uncomfortable with our ability to support markets outside of the United States. Our automobile manufacturer and tier one customers may choose to partner with providers of location services with extensive international operations. We may be at a disadvantage in attracting such customers due to our business being concentrated in the United States, and we may not be successful in other geographies if customers are uncomfortable with the look and feel of our solutions. If we are unable to attract or retain such automobile manufacturer and tier one customers, our revenue and operating results will be negatively affected.. We may incur substantial costs when engaging with a new automotive navigation customer and may not realize substantial revenue from that new customer in the short-term, if at all.. The design and sales cycle for on-board or brought-in automotive navigation services and products is substantially longer than those associated with our mobile navigation services to customers of wireless carriers or our advertising platform services. As a result, we may not be able to achieve significant revenue growth with new customers from the automotive navigation business in a short period of time, or at all. In addition, these lengthy cycles make it difficult to predict if and when we will generate revenue from new customers. For example, design wins for vehicles may be awarded 12 to 36 months prior to the anticipated commercial launch of the vehicle. We also entered into a contract with GM in 2014 to provide worldwide hybrid navigation solutions beginning in model year 2017 and continuing through model year 2025. Although our hybrid product launched in its first GM models, the Cadillac CTS and CTS-V, in February 2017 we did not recognize any revenue from the launch of the product in fiscal 2017 or 2018 due to specified future obligations. We expect that we will begin to recognize this revenue upon the adoption of ASC 606 on July 1, 2018. We cannot assure you that our products will be in a wide variety of geographic markets in which GM sells vehicles in or across a variety of models and brands. GM has not provided us with any volume or revenue guarantees and we cannot assure you that we will ever receive material revenue from these products and services.. We have a partnership with Toyota for Toyota and Lexus vehicles and a separate partnership with Xevo for another navigation solution for Toyota and Lexus vehicles. While we have seen expansion of our latest version of Scout GPS Link solution across more Toyota and Lexus models in fiscal 2019, we expect that Toyota may limit the number of future models or vehicles on which Scout GPS Link is offered by Toyota and Lexus due in part to the offering of alternative brought-in solutions such as Apple's CarPlay, which Toyota recently announced it is offering across certain Toyota models, and the expanded offering of Google's Android Auto solution across more automobile manufacturers. We cannot assure you that we will receive significant revenue from the solutions for Toyota in the long-term. While we continue to invest in our existing and new relationships with automobile manufacturers, if our products do not meet the consumer's expectations, auto manufacturer customers may not continue to offer our solutions.. We also may not price our solutions in such a way that is profitable for us and enables us to recoup the development expenses we incurred to provide such solutions in the time we expect or at all. Development schedules for automotive navigation products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely delivery of these products. 17. Table of Contents. to our customers. To the extent that we charge service fees beyond an initial fee at the time the vehicle is purchased, we may not be successful in gaining traction with customers to provide services and charge ongoing monthly or annual fees outside of the traditional on-board navigation service model.. Our map, POI and other content costs for our automotive navigation solutions are higher than those we have historically paid for our mobile phone-based navigation services and to date we have not been able to use OSM offerings for automotive navigation, other than our Scout GPS Link mobile application for Toyota. Our ability to build demand for our automotive navigation products and services is also dependent upon our ability to provide the products and services in a cost effective manner, which may require us to renegotiate map and POI content relationships to address the specific demands of our automotive navigation products and services.  If we are unable to improve our margins, we may not be able to operate our automotive navigation business profitably. If we fail to achieve revenue growth in any of our automotive navigation solutions (whether on-board, brought-in or other), we may be unable to achieve the benefits of revenue diversification. In addition, our map and content suppliers, HERE and TomTom, are also becoming competitors through the offering of their own automotive navigation services.. The success of our automotive navigation products may be affected by the number of vehicle models offered with our navigation solutions, as well as overall demand for new vehicles.. Our ability to succeed long term in the automotive industry depends on our ability to expand the number of models offered with our navigation solutions by our current automobile manufacturer customers. We are also dependent upon our ability to attract new automobile manufacturers and tier ones. For automobile manufacturers with whom we have established relationships, such as Ford, our success depends on continued production and sale of new vehicles offered with, and adoption by, end users of our products when our product is not a standard feature. Our on-board and hybrid solutions may not satisfy automobile manufacturers' or end customers' expectations for those solutions. If automobile manufacturers and tier ones do not believe that our services meet their customers' needs, our products and services may not be designed into future model year vehicles.  As we move forward, our existing automobile manufacturers and tier ones may not include our solutions in future year vehicles or territories, which would negatively affect our revenue from these products. Production and sale of new vehicles are subject to delay due to forces outside of our control, such as natural disasters, parts shortages and work stoppages, as well as general economic conditions. For example, in May 2018, Ford ceased production of certain of its pickup trucks for several weeks due to a fire at a third party supplier.. We rely on our customers for timely and accurate vehicle and subscriber sales information. A failure or disruption in the provisioning of this data to us would materially and adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively.. We rely on our automobile manufacturers and tier one customers to provide us with reports on the number of vehicles they sell with our on-board, brought-in and hybrid navigation products and services included, depending on the nature of our contractual relationship, and to remit royalties for those sales to us. We also rely on our wireless carrier customers to bill subscribers and collect monthly fees for our mobile navigation services, either directly or through third party service providers. The risk of inaccurate reports may increase as our customers expand internationally and increase the number of manufacturing locations. For example, in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, Ford determined that it had misreported the production of vehicles to us in certain factories.  If our customers or their third party service providers provide us with inaccurate data or experience errors or outages in their own billing and provisioning systems when performing these services, our revenue may be less than anticipated or may be subject to adjustment with the customer. In the past, we have experienced errors in reporting from automobile manufacturers and wireless carriers. If we are unable to identify and resolve discrepancies in a timely manner, our revenue may vary more than anticipated from period to period, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.. Our business practices with respect to data could give rise to liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation, legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection.. Our advertising services depend on our ability to collect, store and use information related to mobile devices and the ads we place, including a device's geographic location for the purpose of targeting ads to the user of the device. Our automotive navigation services also depend on our ability to collect, store and use such information as we deliver personalized navigation.  Federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data that we collect across our mobile advertising and navigation platforms. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection. However, it is possible that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with such laws could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, consumers or others. Such proceedings or actions could hurt our reputation, force us to spend significant amounts to defend ourselves, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, require us to change our advertising services or disclosures, adversely affect. 18. Table of Contents. the demand for our services and ultimately result in the imposition of monetary liability. We may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless our users from the costs or consequences of inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure of data that we store or handle as part of providing our services.. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is still evolving.  For example, the European Union's (\"EU\") General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") took effect in May 2018.  The GDPR replaces Directive 95/46/EC of 1995 and will be directly applicable in EU member states.  Among other things, the GDPR regulates data controllers and processors outside of the EU whose processing activities relate to the offering of goods or services to, or monitoring the behavior within the EU of, EU data subjects.  Complying with the GDPR may cause us to incur substantial operational costs or require us to change our business practices. Despite our efforts to bring practices into compliance before the effective date of the GDPR, we cannot assure you that we are fully compliant. The GDPR imposes significant penalties of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide turnover and \20020 million for breaches of data protection rules. As a result, we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, reputational harm and our business may be seriously harmed if we fail to protect the privacy of third party data or to comply with the GDPR or other applicable regimes. In addition, various government and consumer agencies and public advocacy groups have called for new regulation and changes in industry practices, including some directed at the mobile and advertising industries in particular. It is possible that new laws, regulations, standards, recommendations, best practices or requirements will be adopted that would affect our business, particularly with regard to location-based services, collection or use of data to target ads and communication with consumers via mobile devices. To the extent that we or our clients are subject to new laws or recommendations or choose to adopt new standards, recommendations, or other requirements, we may have greater compliance burdens. If we are perceived as not operating in accordance with industry best practices or any such guidelines or codes with regard to privacy, our reputation may suffer and we could lose relationships with advertiser or developer partners.. The advertising business is subject to seasonality, and we may not successfully grow our advertising revenue if we are unable to attract and retain advertisers.. We believe the advertising business is subject to varying buying patterns and seasonality which can impact our ability to grow our revenue. For example, in the three months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we experienced higher advertising revenue as the second quarter is traditionally stronger due to seasonality; however, advertising revenue subsequently declined sequentially in the three months ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. In fact, our advertising revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was the lowest it had been for any quarter in the last three years.. In order to grow our advertising business, we need to identify and attract a significant number of advertisers through our Thinknear platform. The mobile advertising market is highly competitive, and advertisers have many options through which to purchase mobile advertising. Our business will require us to attract and retain a large number of advertisers and will also require us to maintain the ability to purchase a large volume of inventory at competitively attractive rates.  Increased competition from other mobile advertising companies and technology developers could impair our ability to secure advertiser revenue.  Increased competition could also limit our ability to purchase inventory for advertising placements at an economically attractive rate.  We do not have substantial experience in selling advertising and supporting advertisers and may not be able to develop these capabilities successfully. We may not be successful in retaining experienced sales personnel or recruiting the number of sales personnel we need to scale or effectively train them to sell mobile advertising. Sales personnel may also be slow to ramp up their sales pipelines, negatively impacting our ability to grow. We may not succeed in attracting and retaining a critical mass of advertisers and ad placements and may not be successful in demonstrating the value of mobile advertising. If we are unable to improve the margins of our advertising business, it may not become profitable and may impair our ability to invest in new opportunities or become profitable as a whole.. Mobile connected device users may choose not to allow tracking of their location information and therefore local advertising may not be feasible on their devices.. The growth of our advertising revenue will depend on our ability to deliver location targeted, highly relevant ads to consumers on their mobile connected devices. Our targeted advertising is highly dependent on the consumers allowing applications to have access to their location data. Users may elect not to allow location data sharing for a number of reasons, including personal privacy concerns. Mobile operating systems vendors and application developers are also promoting features that allow device users to disable device functionality that consumers may elect to invoke. In addition, companies may develop products that enable users to prevent ads from appearing on their mobile device screens. If any of these developments were to become widely used by consumers, our ability to deliver effective advertising campaigns on behalf of our advertiser clients would suffer, which could hurt our ability to generate advertising revenue.. 19. Table of Contents. Our legacy wireless carrier mobile navigation business is declining and may be eliminated altogether in the future. As it continues to decline, our revenue and net income or loss will continue to be adversely affected.. Although we historically received a majority of our revenue from wireless carriers whose subscribers received our services through bundles or by purchasing our navigation services, consistent with industry trends, our wireless carrier revenue has declined significantly. In the last three fiscal years, wireless carrier subscribers have materially decreased their subscriptions for, and usage of, our paid navigation services and our revenue from our relationship with wireless carriers has declined accordingly. We anticipate that wireless carrier subscribers will continue to decrease their subscriptions for paid navigation services in favor of free or freemium offerings and that revenue from our relationship with wireless carriers will continue to decline and may be eliminated altogether in the future. In the event that our mobile navigation business ceases to be profitable or we determine that it diverts resources from growing areas of our business, we may ultimately elect to terminate our legacy wireless carrier mobile navigation business. In addition, our wireless carrier customers may determine that the cost of offering our service to their subscribers outweighs the benefits and may decide to terminate our business relationship. Our other sources of revenue from our location-based platforms, including automotive navigation and location-based advertising, have substantially lower margins than wireless carrier mobile navigation revenue and, as a result, we would have to generate substantially more revenue from those services to replace the declining wireless carrier revenue.. Our customer requirements and content management obligations are complex. If we inadvertently include content for which we have liability to the vendor but may not be entitled to payment from our customer, our financial condition and results of operation could be harmed.. The nature and extent of content that is delivered as part of our navigation solutions is complex to manage. Matching the requirements of our customers with the content offered by our vendors may result in our inclusion of content which we believe is necessary to meet our customers' requirements for which the customer may not have agreed to make payment to us. In addition, our customers speak directly to our vendors and often those conversations influence the expected content for our end products; however, customers may not be fully informed as to the license costs associated with the various components. Therefore, there is some risk that we may include content for which we have liability to the vendor but may not be entitled to payment from our customer. If these situations were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.. We face intense competition in our market, especially from competitors that offer their mobile location services for free, which could make it difficult for us to acquire and retain customers and end users.. The market for development, distribution and sale of location services is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, public relations, sales, distribution and other resources than we do. Competitors may offer mobile location services that have at least equivalent functionality to ours for free. For example, Google offers free voice-guided turn by turn navigation as part of its Google Maps and Waze products for mobile devices, including those based on the Android and iOS operating system platforms, and Apple offers proprietary maps and voice-guided turn by turn directions. Microsoft Corporation also provides a free voice-guided turn by turn navigation solution on its Windows Mobile and Windows Phone operating systems.  Competition from these free offerings may reduce our revenue, result in our incurring additional costs to compete and harm our business. If our wireless carrier customers can offer these mobile location services to their subscribers for free, they may elect to cease their relationships with us, similar to Sprint, alter or reduce the manner or extent to which they market or offer our services or require us to substantially reduce our fees or pursue other business strategies that may not prove successful. In addition, new car buyers may not value navigation solutions built in to their vehicles if they believe that free (brought-in) offerings, such as Apple CarPlay or Google's auto initiatives, are adequate and may not purchase our solutions with their new cars.  Ford previously announced that it would open its SYNC 3 product to Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto and announced that Waze will be available on its vehicles equipped with the SYNC 3 platform, which may reduce the number of vehicle purchasers who purchase on-board navigation solutions. While we have seen expansion of our latest version of Scout GPS Link solution across more Toyota and Lexus models in fiscal 2019, we expect that Toyota may limit the number of future models or vehicles on which Scout GPS Link is offered by Toyota and Lexus due in part to the offering of alternative brought-in solutions such as Apple's CarPlay, which Toyota recently announced it is offering across certain Toyota models, and the expanded offering of Google's Android Auto solution across more automobile manufacturers. We may not successfully increase our revenue from Ford or Toyota, and our revenue could decrease, if our products are replaced within vehicles by Ford or Toyota with our competitors' products or due to price competition from third parties.. We compete in the automotive navigation market with established automobile manufacturers and tier ones and providers of on-board navigation services such as AISIN, AutoNavi, Bosch, Elektrobit, Garmin, HERE, Navinfo, NNG, MXNavi and TomTom, as well as other competitors such as Apple and Google. We compete in the advertising network services business with mobile platform providers, including Google, Facebook, Oath, GroundTruth, Verve Wireless, PlaceIQ and NinthDecimal,. 20. Table of Contents. among others. Some of our competitors' and our potential competitors' advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, include the following:. • significantly greater revenue and financial resources;. • ownership of mapping and other content allowing them to offer a more vertically integrated solution;. • stronger brand and consumer recognition in a particular market segment, geographic region or worldwide;. • the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products;. • access to core technology and intellectual property, including more extensive patent portfolios;. • access to custom or proprietary content;. • quicker pace of innovation;. • stronger automobile manufacturer, tier one, advertising agency and advertiser relationships;. • more financial flexibility and experience to make acquisitions;. • ability or demonstrated ability to partner with others to create stronger or new competitors;. • stronger international presence, which could make our larger competitors more attractive partners to automobile manufacturers and tier ones;. • lower labor and development costs; and. • broader global distribution and presence.. Our competitors' and potential competitors' advantages over us could make it more difficult for us to sell our navigation services, and could result in increased pricing pressures, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and failure to increase, or the loss of, market share or expected market share, any of which would likely cause harm to our business, operating results and financial condition.. If we are unable to integrate future acquisitions successfully, our operating results and prospects could be harmed.. In the future, we may make acquisitions to improve our navigation services offerings or expand into new markets. Our future acquisition strategy will depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate acquisitions and, if necessary, to obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing to fund those acquisitions. Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky, and any mergers and acquisitions we complete may not be successful. Future mergers and acquisitions we may pursue would involve, numerous risks, including the following:. • difficulties in integrating and managing the operations, technologies and products of the companies we acquire, that are geographically remote from our existing operations;. • diversion of our management's attention from normal daily operation of our business;. • our inability to maintain the key business relationships and the reputations of the businesses we acquire;. • our inability to retain key personnel of the companies we acquire;. • uncertainty of entry into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have stronger market positions;. • our dependence on unfamiliar affiliates and customers of the companies we acquire;. • insufficient revenue to offset our increased expenses associated with acquisitions;. • our responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we acquire, including those which we may not anticipate; and. • our inability to maintain internal standards, controls, procedures and policies.. We may be unable to secure the equity or debt funding necessary to finance future acquisitions on terms that are acceptable to us. If we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders will likely. 21. Table of Contents. experience dilution, and if we finance future acquisitions with debt funding, we will incur interest expense and may have to comply with financial covenants and secure that debt obligation with our assets.. We may be required to recognize a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired.. We have recorded goodwill related to our prior acquisitions, and may do so in connection with any potential future acquisitions. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually or on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.  Factors that may indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable include a persistent decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry.  We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets is determined, which would adversely impact our results of operations. We report results in three business segments, which requires the allocation of goodwill and intangibles to each of these segments.  As a result, we conduct our impairment review each year or on an interim basis by segment, which can result in a different outcome than if assessed on an overall consolidated basis. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, certain mobile navigation customer contracts were amended and certain other customers indicated their intent with respect to terminating services in the near term. Based upon a qualitative assessment indicating that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the mobile navigation reporting unit was less than its carrying value, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for our mobile navigation segment during the three months ended March 31, 2018. Based on the results of our test, the carrying value of our mobile navigation business exceeded its estimated fair value.  Accordingly, during the three months ended March 31, 2018, we recognized a $2.7 million impairment of all of the goodwill associated with our mobile navigation segment. We may make similar determinations regarding the impairment of goodwill in the future, which could have a material and adverse effect on our profitability.. Warranty claims, product liability claims and product recalls could subject us to significant costs and adversely affect our financial results.. We warrant our automotive navigation products to be free from defects in materials, workmanship and design for periods ranging from three months to seven years. If our navigation services or products contain defects, there are errors in the maps supplied by third party map providers or if our end users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products, collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. If any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages. In addition, if any of our designed products are defective or are alleged to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall campaign. These recall and warranty costs could be exacerbated to the extent they relate to global platforms or we are unable to deliver software updates over the air. Furthermore, recall actions could adversely affect our reputation or market acceptance of our products, particularly if those recall actions cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products. Warranty claims, a successful product liability claim or a requirement that we participate in a product recall campaign may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.. We accrue costs related to warranty claims when they are probable of being incurred and reasonably estimable. Our warranty costs have historically not been material. From time to time, we experience incidents where it may be necessary for us to expend resources to investigate and remedy a potential warranty claim.. We maintain limited insurance against accident related risks involving our products. However, we cannot assure you that this insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, we may be named as a defendant in litigation by consumers individually or on behalf of a class if their handsets or automobiles suffer problems from software downloads from our customers. If we are unable to obtain indemnification from our customer for any damages or legal fees we may incur in connection with such complaints, our financial position may be adversely impacted. In addition, insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs. If we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover an award, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.. Indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement, damages caused by defective software and other losses.. Our agreements with our customers include indemnification provisions. We agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred in connection with our navigation services or products, including as a result of intellectual property infringement, damages caused by defects and damages caused by viruses, worms and other malicious software. The term of these indemnity provisions is generally perpetual after execution of the corresponding agreement, and the maximum potential amount of future. 22. Table of Contents. payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is generally substantial and may be unlimited. In addition, some of these agreements permit our indemnitees to terminate their agreements with us if they determine that the use of our navigation services or products infringes third party intellectual property rights.. We have received, and expect to receive in the future, demands for indemnification under these agreements. These demands can be very expensive to settle or defend, and we have in the past incurred substantial legal fees and settlement costs in connection with certain of these indemnity demands. Furthermore, we have been notified by several customers that they have been named as defendants in certain patent infringement cases for which they may seek indemnification from us. Large future indemnity payments and associated legal fees and expenses, including potential indemnity payments and legal fees and expenses relating to the current or future notifications, could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.. We may in the future agree to defend and indemnify our customers in connection with the pending notifications or future demands, irrespective of whether we believe that we have an obligation to indemnify them or whether we believe that our services and products infringe the asserted intellectual property rights. Alternatively, we may reject certain of our customers' indemnity demands, which may lead to disputes with our customers and may negatively impact our relationships with them or result in litigation against us. Our customers may also claim that any rejection of their indemnity demands constitutes a material breach of our agreements with them, allowing them to terminate such agreements. Our agreements with certain customers may be terminated in the event an infringement claim is made against us and it is reasonably determined that there is a possibility our technology or services infringed upon a third party's rights. If, as a result of indemnity demands, we make substantial payments, our relationships with our customers are negatively impacted or if any of our customer agreements is terminated, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.. Our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the financial markets.. Our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of June 30, 2018 consisted of corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, municipal securities, U.S. agency securities, commercial paper and money market mutual funds. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes.. Should financial market conditions worsen in the future, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns. In addition, any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and expense to vary from expectations. As of June 30, 2018, we had no material impairment charges associated with our short-term investment portfolio. Although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity, or credit availability, and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired.. Our effective tax rate may fluctuate, which could reduce our anticipated income tax benefit in the future.. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control. Our effective tax rate may be affected by the proportion of our revenues and income (loss) before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate. Our revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter. We are also subject to changing tax laws, regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as the requirements of certain tax and other accounting body rulings. Since we must estimate our annual effective tax rate each quarter based on a combination of actual results and forecasted results of subsequent quarters, any significant change in our actual quarterly or forecasted annual results may adversely impact the effective tax rate for the period. Our estimated annual effective tax rate may fluctuate for a variety of reasons, including:. • changes in forecasted annual operating income or loss by jurisdiction and forecasted withholding taxes;. • changes in relative proportions of revenue and income or loss before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate;. • requests by customers to bill their foreign subsidiaries and related entities, which may subject us to income tax withholding requirements on sales made in such jurisdictions;. • changes to the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets;. 23. Table of Contents. • changes to actual or forecasted permanent differences between book and tax reporting, including the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and non-recurring charges which may cause fluctuations between reporting periods;. • impact from any future tax settlements with state, federal or foreign tax authorities;. • impact from increases or decreases in tax reserves due to new assessments of risk, the expiration of the statute of limitations or the completion of government audits;. • impact from changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as the expiration and retroactive reinstatement of tax holidays;. • impact from withholding tax requirements in various non-U.S. jurisdictions and our ability to recoup those withholdings, which may depend on how much revenue we have in a particular jurisdiction to offset the related expenses;. • changes in customer arrangements where the customer's domicile may impose withholding tax on our revenue that we previously were not subject to;. • impact from acquisitions and related integration activities; or. • impact from new Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, requirements.. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in future periods. In fiscal 2014, we recorded a valuation allowance on the majority of our deferred tax assets, net of liabilities since the assets are not more likely than not to be realized based upon our assessment of all positive and negative evidence. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable earnings, the timing of which is uncertain. Due to losses in previous years and expected losses in fiscal 2019 and potentially future years in the United States, we maintained a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the United States. Due to operating losses in previous years and expected losses in future years, we continued to maintain a full valuation allowance for our foreign deferred tax assets in the United Kingdom. In the event deferred tax assets in Germany cannot be realized based upon the ability to generate future income in Germany, our effective tax rate would be negatively impacted.. Changes in accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions. Additionally, the adoption of new or revised accounting principles, such as ASC 606 and ASC 842, Leases, may require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls.. It is not clear if or when other potential changes in accounting principles may become effective, whether we have the proper systems and controls in place to accommodate such changes and the impact that any such changes may have on our financial position and results of operations.. We rely on a proprietary provisioning and reporting system for our navigation products and services to track end user activation, deactivation and usage data and any material failures in this system could harm our revenue, affect our costs and impair our ability to manage our business effectively.. Our provisioning and reporting system that authenticates end users and tracks the number of end users and their use of our services is a proprietary and customized system that we developed internally. Although we believe that the flexibility of this service to integrate tightly with automobile manufacturers' reporting and provisioning systems gives us a competitive advantage, we might lose revenue and the ability to manage our business effectively if the system were to experience material failures or be unable to scale as our business grows. In addition, we may not be able to report our financial results on a timely basis if our customers question the accuracy of our records or we experience significant discrepancies between the data generated by our provisioning and reporting systems and data generated by their systems, or if our systems fail or we are unable to report timely and accurate information to our third party data providers. The inability to timely report our financial results would impair the quality of our financial reporting and could result in the delisting of our common stock.. 24. Table of Contents. We rely on third party data and content to provide our services and if we were unable to obtain content at reasonable prices, or at all, our gross margins and our ability to provide our services would be harmed.. We rely on third party data and content to provide our services, including map data, POI, traffic information, gas prices and weather information. If our suppliers of this data or content were to enter into exclusive relationships with other providers of location services or were to discontinue providing such information and we were unable to replace them cost effectively, or at all, our ability to provide our services would be harmed. Our gross margins may also be affected if the cost of third party data and content increases substantially. Although we have integrated OSM data into our products, we may experience difficulty with customer acceptance if the quality of the consumer generated data within OSM is lower than that of paid maps. We introduced mobile phone-based navigation with OSM and launched our first brought-in automotive navigation service with OSM in 2015. As a result, we may not have sufficient data for automobile manufacturers and tier ones to feel comfortable electing to use OSM in the products and services we provide them.. We obtain map data from TomTom and HERE, which are companies owned by our current and potential competitors. Accordingly, these third party data and content providers may act in a manner that is not in our best interest. For example, they may cease to offer their map and POI data to us. Our agreement with TomTom to license TomTom map data for voice-guided turn by turn GPS navigation service for our existing mobile navigation products was automatically renewed under its existing terms through December 31, 2018. Our license to map data from TomTom will not automatically renew after December 31, 2018, but the license to other data from TomTom under the same agreement will continue for the period set forth in the agreement.   Our master data license agreement with HERE was automatically renewed under its existing terms through January 31, 2019, and automatically renews for successive one year periods unless either party provides notice of non-renewal at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the applicable term. However, individual territory licenses with distinct term, termination and renewal provisions further govern the license of map data to support individual programs and products for our automobile manufacturers and tier ones.. We may identify other requisite content and content-related technologies, including certain geocoding data necessary for our OSM products, that we may be unable to license or develop internally.  If we are unsuccessful in these endeavors, we may be unable to successfully launch our OSM-based products globally and across all desired product offerings.. We may not be able to upgrade our navigation services platform to support certain advanced features and functionality without obtaining technology licenses from third parties. Obtaining these licenses may be costly and may delay the introduction of such features and functionality, and these licenses may not be available on commercially favorable terms, or at all. The inability to offer advanced features or functionality, or a delay in our ability to upgrade our navigation services platform, may adversely affect consumer demand for our navigation services and, consequently, harm our business.. We may be subject to our automobile manufacturer or tier one's selection of map and other content providers, and our ability to negotiate and enter into a license with such provider(s) may be dependent on the timing of such automobile manufacturer or tier one's official nomination for such content providers.  Accordingly, we may have contractual obligations to provide certain products and services for certain model years or periods to our automobile manufacturer or tier one partners, prior to our ability to enter into agreements with our map and other content providers to support such products and services. We may be unable to obtain data licenses with the necessary content providers to support these products and services, or we may not be able to secure such data licenses without additional, unplanned costs or delays.. We also use our proprietary provisioning and reporting system to record and report royalties we owe to third party providers of content used by end users in connection with our services. Certain of the third party content providers have the right to audit our use of their services and, if we are found to have under or incorrectly reported usage, we may be required to pay the third party content providers for the actual usage, as well as interest and the cost of the audit. Any significant error in our recording and payment of royalties to our third party content providers could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results. We may also incur losses as a result of any significant error.. 25. Table of Contents. Network failures, disruptions or capacity constraints in our third party hosted data center facilities could affect the performance of our navigation services and harm our reputation and our revenue.. We use hosted services provided by AWS and wireless carrier networks to deliver our navigation and advertising platform services. Our operations rely to a significant degree on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of the third party data centers we use. In the event that AWS or wireless carrier networks experience a disruption in services or a natural disaster, our ability to continue providing our services would be compromised. Depending on the growth rate in the number of our end users and their usage of our services, if we do not timely complete the negotiation for and scale of additional hosting services, we may experience capacity issues, which could lead to service failures and disruptions. In addition, if we are unable to secure third party hosting services with appropriate power, cooling and bandwidth capacity, we may be unable to efficiently and effectively scale our business to manage the addition of new automobile manufacturers and tier ones, increases in the number of our end users or increases in data traffic.. AWS hosting services are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including fire, flood, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications or computer systems failure, human error, terrorist acts or other events. We have not yet completed a comprehensive business continuity plan and there can be no assurance that the measures implemented by us to date, or measures implemented by us in the future, to manage risks related to network failures or disruptions in our data centers will be adequate, or that the redundancies built into our servers will work as planned in the event of network failures or other disruptions. In particular, if we were to experience damage or interruptions to AWS hosting services our ability to provide efficient and uninterrupted operation of our services would be significantly impaired.. We could also experience failures of our data centers or interruptions of our services, or other problems in connection with our operations, as a result of:. • damage to or failure of our computer software or hardware or our connections and outsourced service arrangements with third parties;. • errors in the processing of data;. • computer viruses or software defects;. • physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events; or. • errors by our employees or third party service providers.. Poor performance in or disruptions of our services could harm our reputation, delay market acceptance of our services and subject us to liabilities. Our automobile manufacturer and tier one agreements for on-board and hybrid navigation solutions require us to meet at least 99.9% operational uptime requirements, excluding scheduled maintenance periods, or be subjected to penalties. Any outage in a network or system, or other unanticipated problem that leads to an interruption or disruption of our navigation services, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.. We may not be able to enhance our location services to keep pace with technological and market developments, or develop new location services in a timely manner or at competitive prices.. The market for location services is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles. To keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasing customer requirements and achieve product acceptance, our future success depends upon our ability to enhance our current navigation services platform and advertising services platform and to continue to develop and introduce new navigation services, advertising services and other location-based product offerings and enhanced performance features and functionality on a timely basis at competitive prices. Our inability, for technological or other reasons, to enhance, develop, introduce or deliver compelling services and products in a timely manner, or at all, in response to changing market conditions, technologies or consumer expectations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or could result in our services becoming obsolete. Our ability to compete successfully will depend in large measure on our ability to maintain a technically skilled development and engineering team and to adapt to technological changes and advances in the industry, including providing for the continued compatibility of our services platform with evolving industry standards and protocols and competitive network operating environments.. 26. Table of Contents. A large percentage of our research and development operations are conducted in China and Romania, and our ability to introduce new services and support our existing services cost effectively depends on our ability to manage those remote development sites successfully.. Our success depends on our ability to enhance our current services and develop new services and products rapidly and cost effectively. A majority of our research and development personnel are in China and Romania. Although we have sought to retain certain key personnel, we may be unable to retain them over the long-term. In addition, we have been experiencing significant increases in compensation costs in China and Romania due to competitive market conditions for qualified staff, as well as higher risk of employee turnover in those markets.. We also expect that we may continue to consolidate certain of our operations or reduce our workforce if we are unable to continue to replace wireless carrier revenue with other sources of high gross margin revenue. These reorganizations or reductions in force could result in unexpected costs or delays in product development that could impair our ability to meet market windows or cause us to forego certain new product opportunities.. Because our long term success depends on our ability to increase the number of end users located outside of the United States, our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations.. As of June 30, 2018, we had international operations in China, Romania, Germany, Japan and South Korea. Our experience with wireless carriers, automobile manufacturers and tier ones, and advertisers outside the United States is limited. Our revenue from customers in the United States comprised 94% and 88% of our total revenue in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. However, our product is distributed globally in many different regions outside the United States, including South America, Europe, Australia, China and New Zealand. Our limited experience in operating our business outside the United States increases the risk that our current and future international expansion efforts may not be successful. In particular, our business model may not be successful in certain countries or regions outside the United States for reasons that we currently do not anticipate. In addition, conducting international operations subjects us to risks that we have not generally faced in the United States. These include:. • fluctuations in currency exchange rates;. • unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;. • difficulties in managing the staffing of remote operations;. • potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems, foreign tax withholding, restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and changes in tax rates;. • difficulties in collecting accounts receivable balances in a timely manner;. • dependence on foreign wireless carriers with different pricing models;. • roaming charges to end users;. • availability of reliable mobile networks in those countries;. • requirements that we comply with local telecommunication regulations and automobile hands free laws in those countries;. • requirements that we comply with local privacy regulations;. • the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and different legal standards;. • increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;. • political, social and economic instability in some jurisdictions;. • terrorist attacks and security concerns in general; and. • reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.. The occurrence of any one of these risks could negatively affect our international business and, consequently, our operating results. Additionally, operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial. 27. Table of Contents. resources. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to establish, acquire or integrate operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability and we may incur larger losses as a result.. We rely on our management team and need specialized personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business.. Our success and future growth depend on the skills, working relationships and continued services of our management team. Our future performance will depend on our ability to continue to retain our senior management, particularly in the growth areas of our business, such as automotive and advertising.. Our future success also depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled personnel in the United States and internationally. All of our U.S. employees work for us on an at will basis. Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense, particularly in the software industry and for persons with experience with GPS and location services. The high degree of competition for personnel we experience has resulted in and may also continue to result in the incurrence of significantly higher compensation costs to attract, hire and retain employees. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in attracting, hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached the former employees' legal obligations to the former employer, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources.  In addition, existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment. If our stock price performs poorly, it may adversely affect our ability to retain highly skilled employees. Our inability to attract and retain the necessary personnel could adversely affect our business and future growth prospects.. We rely on network infrastructures provided by our wireless carriers, mobile phones and in-car wireless connections for the delivery of our navigation services to end users.. We generally provide our navigation services from third party hosted servers, which require close integration with the wireless carriers' networks. We may be unable to provide high quality services if the wireless carriers' networks perform poorly or experience delayed response times. Our future success will depend on the availability and quality of our wireless carrier customers' networks in the United States and abroad to run our mobile navigation services. This includes deployment and maintenance of reliable networks with the speed, data capacity and security necessary to provide reliable wireless communications services. We do not establish or maintain these wireless networks and have no control over interruptions or failures in the deployment and maintenance by wireless carrier customers of their network infrastructure. In addition, these wireless network infrastructures may be unable to support the demands placed on them if the number of subscribers increases, or if existing or future subscribers increase their use of limited bandwidth. Market acceptance of our mobile navigation services will depend in part on the quality of these wireless networks and the ability of our customers to effectively manage their subscribers' expectations.. In addition, certain automotive navigation applications rely on wireless connections between the vehicle and our network. We have no influence or control over the vehicle's wireless equipment and if it does not operate in a satisfactory manner, our ability to provide those services would be impaired and our reputation would be harmed.. Wireless communications have experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of infrastructure and equipment failures and could face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could affect our ability to provide our navigation services successfully. In addition, changes by a wireless carrier to its network infrastructure may interfere with the integration of our servers with their network and delivery of our navigation services and may cause end users to lose functionality for services they have already purchased. Any of the foregoing could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.. We cannot control the quality standards of our wireless carriers, their mobile phone providers, automobile manufacturers and other technology infrastructure providers. We cannot guarantee that the mobile phones or in-car wireless equipment are free from errors or defects. If errors or defects occur in mobile phones or services offered by our wireless carrier customers, it could result in consumers terminating our services, damage to our reputation, increased customer service and support costs, warranty claims, lost revenue and diverted development resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Mergers, consolidations or other strategic transactions in the mapping data industry could weaken our competitive position, reduce the number of our map providers and adversely affect our business.. The mapping data industry continues to experience consolidation. Should one of our map providers consolidate or enter into an alliance with another navigation provider, this could have a material adverse impact on our business. Currently, two of. 28. Table of Contents. our map suppliers are owned by competitors in the navigation space. Such a consolidation may cause us to lose a map supplier or require us to increase the royalties we pay to map vendors as a result of enhanced supplier leverage, which would have a negative effect on our business.  In the event that we lose a map supplier, we may be unable to replace our map suppliers and the remaining map suppliers may increase license fees.  In addition, as we continue to use more OSM-based maps and no longer purchase maps from those suppliers, we may be unable to purchase other data that is integral to our navigation products from our existing map suppliers.. Changes in business direction and market conditions could lead to charges related to structural reorganization and discontinuation of certain products or services, which may adversely affect our financial results.. In response to changing market conditions and the desire to focus on new and more potentially attractive opportunities, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, eliminating, or otherwise exiting certain business activities.  Any decision to reduce investment in, dispose of, or otherwise exit business activities may result in the recording of special charges, such as workforce reduction and excessive facility space costs.. Risks related to our intellectual property and regulation. We operate in an industry with extensive intellectual property litigation. Claims of infringement against us, our customers, or other business partners may cause our business, operating results and financial condition to suffer.. Our commercial success depends in part upon us, our partners and our customers not infringing intellectual property rights owned by others and being able to resolve claims of intellectual property infringement without major financial expenditures and/or need to alter our technologies or cease certain activities. We operate in an industry with extensive intellectual property litigation and it is not uncommon for our automobile manufacturers and tier ones and competitors to be involved in infringement lawsuits by or against third parties. Many industry participants that own, or claim to own, intellectual property aggressively assert their rights, and our customers and other business partners, who we agree in certain circumstances to indemnify for intellectual property infringement claims related to our services, are often targets of such assertions. We cannot determine with certainty whether any existing or future third party intellectual property rights would require us to alter our technologies, obtain licenses or cease certain activities.. We have received, and may in the future receive, claims from third parties alleging infringement and other related claims. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we were named as a defendant in certain cases alleging that our services infringe other parties' patents, as well as other matters. See Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings,\" for a description of these matters. These cases and future litigation may make it necessary to defend ourselves and our customers and other business partners by determining the scope, enforceability and validity of third party proprietary rights or to establish our proprietary rights. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater resources than we do and may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could. In addition, patent holding companies that focus solely on extracting royalties and settlements by enforcing patent rights may target us, our wireless carrier customers or our other business partners. These companies typically have little or no product revenue and therefore our patents may provide little or no deterrence against such companies filing patent infringement lawsuits against us. Regardless of whether claims that we are infringing patents or other intellectual property rights have any merit, these claims are time consuming and costly to evaluate and defend and could:. • adversely affect our relationships with our current or future customers and other business partners;. • cause delays or stoppages in the shipment of Telenav enabled or preloaded mobile phones or vehicles, or cause us to modify or suspend the provision of our navigation services;. • cause us to incur significant expenses in defending claims brought against our customers, other business partners or us;. • divert management's attention and resources;. • subject us to significant damages or settlements;. • require us to enter into settlements, royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms; or. • require us or our business partners to cease certain activities and/or modify our products or services.. In addition to liability for monetary damages against us or, in certain circumstances, our customers, we may be prohibited from developing, commercializing or continuing to provide certain of our navigation services unless we obtain licenses from the holders of the patents or other intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any such. 29. Table of Contents. licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we do not obtain such licenses, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected and we could, for example, be required to cease offering our navigation services or be required to materially alter our navigation services, which could involve substantial costs and time to develop.. Unauthorized control or manipulation of our systems in vehicles may cause them to operate improperly or not at all, or compromise their safety and data security, which could result in loss of confidence in us and our products, cancellation of contracts with certain of our automobile manufacturer or tier one customers and harm our business.. There have been reports of vehicles of certain automobile manufacturers being \"hacked\" to grant access and operation of the vehicles to unauthorized persons and would-be thieves. Modern vehicles are technologically advanced machines requiring the interoperation of numerous complex and evolving hardware and software systems, including the navigation system, and with respect to vehicles with autonomous driving features, control of the vehicle. We have agreed with some of our automobile manufacturer and tier one customers to adopt certain security procedures and we may be subject to claims or our contracts with those automobile manufacturers and tier ones may be terminated if we do not comply with our covenants or if our products are the source of access to the systems in their vehicles by intruders.. Although we have designed, implemented and tested security measures to prevent unauthorized access to our products when installed in vehicles, our information technology networks and communications with vehicles in which our products are installed may be vulnerable to interception, manipulation, damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to errors by personnel who have access to our networks and systems. Any such attacks or breaches could result in unexpected control of or changes to the vehicles' functionality and our products' user interface and performance characteristics. Hackers may also use similar means to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle, such as its current geographical position, previous and stored destination address history and web browser \"favorites.\" Any such unauthorized control of vehicles or access to or loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and negative publicity, which would negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.. Our business is subject to online security risks, including security and privacy breaches.. Our business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of users' personal data including information about location, routes mapped and taken. Additionally, our apps transmit information to users' personal devices, which creates opportunities for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities, if any, in our apps. An increasing number of organizations, including large online and offline merchants and businesses, other large Internet companies, financial institutions, and government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks, including on portions of their websites or infrastructure. While we are investing significant resources to evaluate and improve our security, we have been subject to such attacks in the past, although they have not, to our knowledge, resulted in the disclosure of user information or been maliciously exploited. A breach of security or privacy could have negative consequences to our reputation, which could result in users discontinuing or reducing their use of our products and our automotive and advertising customers terminating their agreements with us, and could have significant out-of-pocket financial impact, which could harm our business. Similarly, a breach of security or privacy in vehicles in which our navigation products are installed could result in a reduction in adoption of our navigation products.. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper or illegal access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage our systems or access our data change frequently, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized until launched against a target. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources and may therefore be even more difficult to detect. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Unauthorized parties also may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving our employees, contractors and temporary staff. A party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our, our customers' or our employees' personal or proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations and damage our computers and systems or those of our customers. In addition, our customers have been and likely will continue to be targeted by parties using fraudulent \"spoof\" and \"phishing\" emails to misappropriate user names, passwords, payment card numbers, GPS data or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware, including through \"trojan horse\" programs, to our users' phones and vehicles. Also, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security incidents, and third parties may be able to access our customers' personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through our systems. Any security or privacy breach at a company providing services to us or our tier one customers, or integrated with our products and services, could have similar effects. We may also need to expend significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy breaches or to redress problems caused by breaches. These issues are likely to become more difficult and costly as we expand the number of markets where we operate. Additionally, our insurance policies carry low coverage limits, which may not. 30. Table of Contents. be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches, and we may not be able to collect fully, if at all, under these insurance policies.. Vulnerabilities in our products and services have been publicly disclosed before, and if we are unable to adequately detect and address vulnerabilities in our products and services, it may result in harm to our business.. As with any application, our products may contain known and unknown vulnerabilities, coding errors, design flaws, or other issues that could allow an attacker to maliciously exploit our software.  Vulnerabilities in our software and applications have been publicly exposed in the past, although they have not, to our knowledge, resulted in the disclosure of user information or been maliciously exploited.  While we are investing significantly to evaluate and improve our security on the vulnerabilities we have identified, addressing vulnerabilities in our software is an ongoing process.  Malicious exploitation of our products could result in the introduction of malicious software onto our users' devices, the theft of confidential or private information, damage to users' devices, and harm to our reputation, among other issues.  Successful exploitation of a vulnerability in our software may subject us to numerous lawsuits or regulatory inquiries.   Additionally, the disclosure of any vulnerability may result in a loss of confidence in us or our products, the cancellation of contracts with certain of our automotive tier one customers, discontinued use of our products, and harm to our business and reputation.  These events could have significant out-of-pocket financial impact.. Changes in government regulation of the wireless communications, the automobile and mobile advertising industries may adversely affect our business.. It is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted in the United States and elsewhere that could restrict the wireless communications industry, further regulate the automobile industry or impair the mobile advertising industry, including laws and regulations regarding lawful interception of personal data, hands free use of mobile phones or navigation services within autos, autonomous driving or the control of such use, privacy, taxation, content suitability, copyright and antitrust. Furthermore, the growth and development of electronic storage of personal information may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours that store personal information. We anticipate that regulation of the industries in which our products and services are used will increase and that we will be required to devote legal and other resources to address this regulation. In addition, governments have recently begun to consider and adopt laws regarding vehicles using ADAS and semi-autonomous driving capabilities and those laws may curtail or preclude using the services our products provide.  Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States or elsewhere regarding the wireless communications or automobile industries may make operation more costly, and may materially reduce our ability to increase or maintain sales of our products and services.. Government regulation designed to protect end user privacy may make it difficult for us to provide our services or adopt advertising based revenue models.. We transmit and store a large volume of personal information in the course of providing our products and services. This information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world. This government action is typically intended to protect the privacy and security of personal or sensitive information that is collected, stored and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.. Legislation may also be adopted in various jurisdictions that prohibits use of personal information and search histories to target end users with tailored advertising, or provide advertising at all. Although our advertising revenue to date is not significant, we anticipate we will continue to grow advertising revenue in the future to improve average revenue per user in certain markets.. We could be adversely affected if domestic or international legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business. For example, the USA PATRIOT Act provides certain rights to U.S. law enforcement authorities to obtain personal information in the control of U.S. persons and entities without notifying the affected individuals. If we are required to allocate significant resources to modify the delivery of our services to enable enhanced legal interception of the personal information that we transmit and store, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.. In addition, because various foreign jurisdictions have different laws and regulations concerning the storage and transmission of personal or sensitive information, we may face unknown requirements that pose compliance challenges in new international markets that we seek to enter. Such variation could subject us to costs, delayed service launches, liabilities or negative publicity that could impair our ability to expand our operations into some countries and therefore limit our future growth.. 31. Table of Contents. As privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues, we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of personal or sensitive information. These and other privacy concerns could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.. If we are unable to obtain the required government licenses or approvals to comply with government regulation relating to map data and location based services, we may not be able to provide our products and services and our business could be adversely impacted.. A number of countries and local jurisdictions require certain licenses and/or government approvals in order to comply with regulations governing the creation or distribution map data and/or the provision of location based services, including the collection of location information.  If we are unable to obtain the necessary licenses or approvals or fail to comply with the regulations in each jurisdiction where we or our partners offer location based products and services, we may be unable to offer to our partners or customers the full scope of planned products and services. In addition, should any map or location based services related regulations change, we may incur additional expense in modifying our existing products and product roadmaps to comply with the requirements of individual jurisdictions. Such laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations regarding the provision of map data or location based services may make operation more costly, and may materially reduce our ability to increase or maintain sales of our products and services.. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, our competitive position and our business could be harmed.. We rely primarily on a combination of patent laws, trademark laws, copyright laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology. However, our issued patents and any future patents that may be issued may not survive a legal challenge to their scope, validity or enforceability, or provide significant protection for us. The failure of our patents to adequately protect our technology might make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products or technologies. In addition, patents may not be issued from any of our current or future applications.. Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. We may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Our competitors may also independently develop similar technology. In addition, the laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering products that incorporate our most technologically advanced features, which could seriously reduce demand for our navigation services. In addition, we may in the future need to initiate infringement claims or litigation. Litigation, whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant, can be expensive, time consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel, which could harm our business, whether or not such litigation results in a determination favorable to us.. Confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information.. We have devoted substantial resources to the development of our proprietary technology, including the proprietary software components of our navigation services and related processes. In order to protect our proprietary technology and processes, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, licensees, independent contractors and other advisors. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.. Our use of open source software could negatively affect our ability to sell our service and subject us to possible litigation.. We use open source software in our navigation services platform and client applications and may use more open source software in the future.  Use of open source software may subject our navigation services platform and client applications to general release or require us to re-engineer our navigation services platform and client applications, which may cause harm to our business.  From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we combine our proprietary software products with open source software in a certain manner, we. 32. Table of Contents. could, under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release our proprietary source code. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software. Open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. If we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, re-engineer our navigation services platform and client applications, discontinue the sale of our service in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.. Risks related to being a publicly traded company and holding our common stock. As a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not always complete our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or such internal control may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we test our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures annually. For example, as of June 30, 2018, we performed system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in the future, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock may decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NASDAQ Global Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require significant additional financial and management resources.. We will continue to incur high costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could harm our operating results.. As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with current corporate governance requirements, including requirements under Section 404 and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and the stock exchange on which our common stock is traded. We are generally not eligible to report under reduced disclosure requirements or benefit from longer phase in periods for \"emerging growth companies\" as such term is defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Act of 2012. The expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have increased dramatically over the past several years. We expect these rules and regulations to continue to impact our legal and financial compliance costs substantially and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. We are unable currently to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. We also expect that, over time, it may be more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers if we cannot provide a level of insurance coverage that they believe is adequate.. Regulations relating to investments in offshore companies by Chinese residents may subject our Chinese-resident beneficial owners or our Chinese subsidiaries to liability or penalties, limit our ability to inject capital into our Chinese subsidiaries, limit our Chinese subsidiaries' ability to increase their registered capital or limit their ability to distribute profits to us.. On July 4, 2014, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of the People's Republic of China, or SAFE, promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents' Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 37, which replaced the former Circular on Issues Relating to the Administration of Foreign Exchange in Fund-Raising and Round Trip Investment Activities of Domestic Residents Conducted via Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles (commonly known as \"SAFE Circular 75\") promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. Circular 37 requires Chinese residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such Chinese residents' legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in Circular 37 as a \"special purpose vehicle.\" Circular 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by Chinese individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In the event that a Chinese shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the Chinese subsidiaries of that special. 33. Table of Contents. purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent and from carrying out all subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities in worst scenario, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its Chinese subsidiary. Furthermore, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under Chinese law for evasion of foreign exchange controls. On February 13, 2015, SAFE promulgated a Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving Foreign Exchange Administration Policy on Direct Investment, or Circular 13, which became effective on June 1, 2015.  Pursuant to Circular 13, entities and individuals are required to apply for foreign exchange registration of overseas direct investment, including those required under Circular 37, with qualified banks, instead of SAFE. The qualified banks, under the supervision of SAFE, will directly review the applications and conduct the registration.. We attempt to comply, and attempt to ensure that our stockholders who are subject to Circular 37 and other related rules, comply with the relevant requirements under Circular 37. However, we cannot provide any assurances that all of our stockholders who are Chinese residents have complied or will comply with our request to make or obtain any applicable registrations or comply with other requirements required by Circular 37 or other related rules. Any failure or inability of any of our stockholders who is a Chinese resident to comply with relevant requirements under Circular 37 could subject such stockholders or our Chinese subsidiaries to fines and legal sanctions imposed by the Chinese government and may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital into our Chinese subsidiaries or receive dividends or other distributions from our Chinese subsidiaries. As a result, these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline.. We expect that the trading price for our common stock will be affected by any research or reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. As of June 30, 2018, only four research analysts published reports regarding our company. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, our stock may lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause its price to decline. In addition, if any analysts who may elect to cover us downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. For example, in late July 2011, following our earnings release for the three months and fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, several financial analysts published research reports lowering their price targets of our stock. After our announcement and the publication of these reports, our stock price fell more than 40%. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, our stock may lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause its price to decline. If our stock was to trade at prices below $5.00 per share in the future for an extended period of time, financial analysts may terminate coverage of our company due to internal policies within their investment banks, which could result in further stock price declines.. Our stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate in the future.. Our common stock was sold in our IPO at $8.00 per share. Although our common stock has traded at prices as high as $22.07 per share, it has also traded at prices as low as $4.47 and has tended to have significant downward and upward price movements in a relatively short time period. Future fluctuations or declines in the trading price of our common stock may result from a number of events or factors, including those discussed in the preceding risk factors relating to our operations, as well as:. • actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;. • changes in the financial projections we may provide to the public or our failure to meet these projections;. • announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, relationship changes with key customers, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital raising activities or capital commitments;. • the public's response to our press releases or other public announcements, including our filings with the SEC;. • lawsuits threatened or filed against us; and. • large distributions of our common stock by significant stockholders to limited partners or others who immediately resell the shares.. General market conditions and domestic or international macroeconomic factors unrelated to our performance, such as the continuing unprecedented volatility in the financial markets, may also affect our stock price. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent trends to predict future stock prices or financial results. Investors in our common stock may not be able to dispose of the shares they purchased at prices above the IPO price, or, depending on market conditions, at all.. 34. Table of Contents. In addition, if the market price of our common stock falls below $5.00 per share for an extended period of time, under stock exchange rules, our stockholders will not be able to use such shares as collateral for borrowing in margin accounts. Further, certain institutional investors are restricted from investing in shares priced below $5.00 per share. This inability to use shares of our common stock as collateral and the inability of certain institutional investors to invest in our shares may depress demand and lead to sales of such shares creating downward pressure on and increased volatility in the market price of our common stock.. In the past, the market price for our common stock has traded only slightly above the cash value of our common stock.  If investors do not value our company as an ongoing business and only value it for the cash on our balance sheet, our stock price may decline if we continue to incur net losses and use our cash to fund operations.  We may also attract investors who are looking for short-term gains in our shares rather than being interested in our long-term outlook.  As a result, the price of our common stock may be volatile.. The concentration of ownership of our capital stock limits your ability to influence corporate matters.. Our executive officers, directors, current 5% or greater stockholders and entities affiliated with them beneficially owned (as determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC) approximately 42.6% of our common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2018. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders. Also, these stockholders, acting together, may be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change of control would benefit our other stockholders."
