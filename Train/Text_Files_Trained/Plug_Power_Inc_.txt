[1] "Item 1A.  Risk Factors. The following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10 - K. The occurrence of any of the following material risks could harm our business and future results of operations and could result in the trading price of our common stock declining and a partial or complete loss of your investment. These risks are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations and trading price of our common stock. Except as mentioned under \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk\" and except for the historical information contained herein, the discussion contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 - K contains \"forward - looking statements,\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, that involve risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the section entitled \"Forward - Looking Statements.\". We have incurred losses and anticipate continuing to incur losses.. We have not achieved operating profitability in any quarter since our formation and we will continue to incur net losses until we can produce sufficient revenue to cover our costs. Our net losses were approximately $127.1 million in 2017, $57.5 million in 2016, $55.7 million in 2015, $88.5 million in 2014, and $62.7 million in 2013. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.2 billion. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses until we can produce and sell our products on a large - scale and cost - effective basis. We cannot guarantee when we will operate profitably, if ever. In order to achieve profitability, we must successfully execute our planned path to profitability in the early adoption markets on which we are focused. The hydrogen infrastructure that is needed to support our growth readiness and cost efficiency must be available and cost efficient. We must continue to shorten the cycles in our product roadmap with respect to improvement in product reliability and performance that our customers expect. We must execute on successful introduction of our products into the market. We must accurately evaluate our markets for, and react to, competitive threats in both other technologies (such as advanced batteries) and our technology field. Finally, we must continue to lower our products' build costs and lifetime service costs. If we are unable to successfully take these steps, we may never operate profitably, and, even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability in the future.. In addition, the primary current value proposition for our customers stems from productivity gains in using our solutions. Longer term, given evolving market dynamics and changes in alternative energy tax credits, if we are unable to successfully develop future products that are competitive with competing technologies in terms of price, reliability and longevity, customers may not buy our products. The profitability of our products depends largely on material and manufacturing costs and the market price of hydrogen. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to lower these costs to the levels to assure market acceptance in conjunction with other critical customer criteria in performance and reliability.. We may require additional capital funding and such capital may not be available to us.. On December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $24.8 million, restricted cash of $43.2 million and net working capital of $3.9 million. This compares to $46.0 million, $54.6 million and $44.4 million, respectively, on December 31, 2016. Restricted cash becomes available to us as we perform in accordance with the related leasing agreements.. Our cash requirements relate primarily to working capital needed to operate and grow our business, including funding operating expenses, growth in inventory to support both shipments of new units and servicing the installed base, growth in equipment leased to customers under long-term arrangements, funding the growth in our GenKey \"turn-key\" solution, which includes the installation of our customers' hydrogen infrastructure as well as delivery of the hydrogen fuel,  continued expansion of our markets, such as Europe and China, continued development and expansion of our products,. 8. Table of Contents. such as Pro Gen, payment of lease obligations under sale/leaseback financings, and the repayment or refinancing of our long-term debt. Our ability to achieve profitability and meet future liquidity needs and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the timing and quantity of product orders and shipments; attaining and expanding positive gross margins across all product lines; the timing and amount of our operating expenses; the timing and costs of working capital needs; the timing and costs of building a sales base; the ability of our customers to obtain financing to support commercial transactions; our ability to obtain financing arrangements to support the sale or leasing of our products and services to customers, including financing arrangements to repay or refinance our long-term debt, and the terms of such agreements that may require us to pledge or restrict substantial amounts of our cash to support these financing arrangements; the timing and costs of developing marketing and distribution channels; the timing and costs of product service requirements; the timing and costs of hiring and training product staff; the extent to which our products gain market acceptance; the timing and costs of product development and introductions; the extent of our ongoing and new research and development programs; and changes in our strategy or our planned activities. If we are unable to fund our operations with positive cash flows and cannot obtain external financing, we may not be able to sustain future operations.  As a result, we may be required to delay, reduce and/or cease our operations and/or seek bankruptcy protection.. We cannot assure you that any necessary additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. We believe that it could be difficult to raise additional funds and there can be no assurance as to the availability of additional financing or the terms upon which additional financing may be available. Additionally, even if we raise sufficient capital through additional equity or debt financings, strategic alternatives or otherwise, there can be no assurance that the revenue or capital infusion will be sufficient to enable us to develop our business to a level where it will be profitable or generate positive cash flow. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If we incur additional debt, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness, thus limiting funds available for our business activities. The terms of any debt securities issued could also impose significant restrictions on our operations. Broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance, and may adversely impact our ability to raise additional funds. If we raise additional funds through collaborations and/or licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.. If we cannot obtain financing to support the sale or leasing of our products and services to customers, such failure may adversely affect our sales, profitability and liquidity.. Customers representing most of our revenue lease, rather than purchase, our products. These lease arrangements require us to finance the purchase of such products, either ourselves or through third - party financing sources. For example, approximately $42.2 million of our cash is currently restricted to support such leasing arrangements, which prevents us from using such cash for other purposes. To date, we have been successful in obtaining or providing the necessary financing arrangements. There is no certainty, however, that we will be able to continue to obtain or provide adequate financing for these arrangements on acceptable terms, or at all, in the future. Failure to obtain or provide such financing may result in the loss of material customers and product sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, if we are required to continue to pledge or restrict substantial amounts of our cash to support these financing arrangements, such cash will not be available to us for other purposes, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position.. Our stock price and stock trading volume has been and could remain volatile.. The market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility. In 2017, the sales price of our common stock fluctuated from a high of $3.21 per share to a low of $0.83 per share. Our progress in developing and commercializing our products, our quarterly operating results, announcements of new products by us or our competitors, our perceived prospects, changes in securities' analysts' recommendations or earnings estimates, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, adverse events related to our strategic relationships, significant sales of our common stock by existing stockholders, including one or more of our strategic partners, and other developments affecting us or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and may adversely affect the price of our common stock. Such market price volatility could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital. In addition, we may be subject to additional securities class action. 9. Table of Contents. litigation as a result of volatility in the price of our common stock, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management's attention and resources and could harm our stock price, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the market perception that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.. Additionally, market conditions may result in volatility in the level of, and fluctuations in, the market prices of stocks generally and, in turn, our common stock and sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the market, in each case being unrelated or disproportionate to changes in our operating performance.. We depend on a concentration of anchor customers for the majority of our revenues and the loss of any of these customers would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. We sell most of our products to a range of customers that include a few anchor customers, and while we are continually seeking to expand our customer base, we expect this will continue for the next several years.  For example, for the year ended December 31, 2017, 71.8% of total consolidated revenues were associated primarily with Amazon and Walmart, representing 42.4% and 29.4%, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, 34.1% and 56.7%, respectively, of total consolidated revenues were associated primarily with Walmart.  Any decline in business with significant customers could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our future success is dependent upon the continued purchases of our products by a small number of customers.  If we are unable to broaden our customer base and expand relationships with potential customers, our business will continue to be impacted by demand fluctuations due to our dependence on a small number of customers. Demand fluctuations can have a negative impact on our revenues, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our dependence on a small number of major customers exposes us to additional risks.  A slowdown, delay or reduction in a customer's orders could result in excess inventories or unexpected quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and liquidity.  Each of our major customers has significant purchasing leverage over us to require changes in sales terms including pricing, payment terms and product delivery schedules, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  If one of our major customers delays payment of or is unable to pay their receivables, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. Our product sales and performance depends on the availability of hydrogen.. Our products and services depend largely on the availability of hydrogen gas. We are dependent upon hydrogen suppliers for success with the profitable commercialization of our products and services. Although we will continue to work with hydrogen suppliers to mutually agree on terms for our customers, including, but not limited to, the competitiveness of the price of the hydrogen fuel, liquid hydrogen, hydrogen infrastructure and service costs, to the benefit of our product value proposition, ultimately we have no control over such third parties. If these fuels are not readily available or if their prices are such that energy produced by our products costs more than energy provided by other sources, then our products could be less attractive to potential users and our products' value proposition could be negatively affected. If hydrogen suppliers elect not to participate in the material handling market, there may be an insufficient supply of hydrogen for this market that could negatively affect our sales and deployment of our products and services.. Delays in or not completing our product development goals may adversely affect our revenue and profitability. If we experience delays in meeting our development goals, our products exhibit technical defects, or if we are unable to meet cost or performance goals, including power output, useful life and reliability, the profitable commercialization of our products will be delayed. In this event, potential purchasers of our products may choose alternative technologies and any delays could allow potential competitors to gain market advantages. We cannot assure that we will successfully meet our commercialization schedule in the future.. Periodically, we may enter into contracts with our customers for certain products that have not been developed or produced. There can be no assurance that we will complete the development of these products and meet the specifications required to fulfill customer agreements and deliver products on schedule. Pursuant to such agreements, the customers would have the right to provide notice to us if, in their good faith judgment, we have materially deviated from. 10. Table of Contents. such agreements. Should a customer provide such notice, and we cannot mutually agree to a modification to the agreement, then the customer may have the right to terminate the agreement, which could adversely affect our future business.. Other than our current products, which we believe to be commercially viable at this time, we do not know when or whether we will successfully complete research and development of other commercially viable products that could be critical to our future. If we are unable to develop additional commercially viable products, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become profitable. The profitable commercialization of our products depends on our ability to reduce the costs of our components and subsystems, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to sufficiently reduce these costs. In addition, the profitable commercialization of our products requires achievement and verification of their overall reliability, efficiency and safety targets, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop, acquire or license the technology necessary to achieve these targets. We must complete additional research and development to fill our product portfolios and deliver enhanced functionality and reliability in order to manufacture additional commercially viable products in commercial quantities. In addition, while we are conducting tests to predict the overall life of our products, we may not have run our products over their projected useful life prior to large - scale commercialization. As a result, we cannot be sure that our products will last as long as predicted, resulting in possible warranty claims and commercial failures.. The reduction or elimination of government subsidies and economic incentives for alternative energy technologies, or the failure to renew such subsidies and incentives could reduce demand for our products.. We believe that the near - term growth of alternative energy technologies is affected by the availability and size of government and economic incentives. Many of these government incentives expire, phase out over time, may exhaust the allocated funding, or require renewal by the applicable authority. In addition, these incentive programs could be reduced or discontinued for other reasons. The investment tax credit under the U.S. tax code was renewed in February 2018 and is scheduled to expire December 31, 2022.  The renewal allows for a 30% investment tax credit which begins to phase out from 2020 to 2022. The reduction, elimination, or expiration of the investment tax credit or other government subsidies and economic incentives, or the failure to renew such tax credit, governmental subsidies, or economic incentives, may result in the diminished economic competitiveness of our products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect the growth of alternative energy technologies, including our products, as well as our future operating results and liquidity.. Certain component quality issues have resulted in adjustments to our warranty reserves and the accrual for loss contracts.. In the past, quality issues have arisen with respect to certain components in certain products that are currently being used at customer sites. Under the terms of our extended maintenance contracts, we have had to retrofit units subject to component quality issues with replacement components that will improve the reliability of our products for our customers. We recorded a provision for loss contracts related to service in prior years. Though, we continue to work with our vendors on these component issues to improve quality and reliability,  unanticipated additional quality issues or warranty claims may arise and, additional material charges may be incurred in the future.  Quality issues also could cause profitable maintenance contracts to become unprofitable.. In addition, from time to time we experience other unexpected design or product performance issues. We make significant investment in the continued improvement of our products and maintains appropriate warranty reserves for known and unexpected issues; however, unknown malfunctions or design defects could result in unexpected material liabilities and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation, cash flows and prospects. In addition, a well - publicized actual or perceived problem could adversely affect the market's perception of our products resulting in a decline in demand for our products and could divert the attention of our management, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.. Our products and services face intense competition.. The markets for energy products are intensely competitive. Some of our competitors in the motive power sector (predominantly incumbent technologies) are much larger than we are and may have the manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities to complete research, development and commercialization of profitable, commercially viable products more quickly and effectively than we can. There are many companies engaged in all areas of traditional and alternative energy generation in the United States and abroad, including, among others, major electric, oil, chemical, natural gas, battery, generator and specialized electronics firms, as well as universities, research institutions and foreign. 11. Table of Contents. government - sponsored companies. These firms are engaged in forms of power generation such as advanced battery technologies, generator sets, fast charged technologies and other types of fuel cell technologies. Technological advances in alternative energy products, battery systems or other fuel cell technologies may make our products less attractive or render them obsolete.. A material change in cost,  performance, availability, or development of key suppliers' products could have a material adverse effect on our business.. We have certain key suppliers who we rely on for critical components in our products, and there are numerous other components for our products that are sole sourced. A supplier's failure to develop and supply components in a timely manner or at all, or to develop or supply components that meet our quality, quantity or cost requirements, or our inability to obtain substitute sources of these components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us, could harm our ability to manufacture our products. In addition, to the extent that our supply partners use technology or manufacturing processes that are proprietary, we may be unable to obtain comparable components from alternative sources.. In addition, commodity prices and supply levels affect our costs. For example, platinum is a key material in our PEM fuel cells. Platinum is a scarce natural resource and we are dependent upon a sufficient supply of this commodity. Any shortages could adversely affect our ability to produce commercially viable fuel cell systems and significantly raise our cost of producing our fuel cell systems. While we do not anticipate significant near -  or long - term shortages in the supply of platinum, a shortage could adversely affect our ability to produce commercially viable PEM fuel cells or raise our cost of producing such products.. We may be unable to establish or maintain relationships with third parties for certain aspects of continued product development, manufacturing, distribution and servicing and the supply of key components for our products.. We may also need to maintain and may need to enter into additional strategic relationships in order to complete our current product development and commercialization plans. We may also require partners to assist in the sale, servicing and supply of components for our current products and anticipated products, which are in development. If we are unable to identify, enter into, and maintain satisfactory agreements with potential partners, including those relating to the supply, distribution, service and support of our current products and anticipated products, we may not be able to complete our product development and commercialization plans on schedule or at all. We may also need to scale back these plans in the absence of needed partners, which could adversely affect our future prospects for development and commercialization of future products. While we have entered into relationships with suppliers of some key components for our products, we do not know when or whether we will secure supply relationships for all required components and subsystems for our products, or whether such relationships will be on terms that will allow us to achieve our objectives. Our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we fail to secure relationships with entities that can develop or supply the required components for our products and provide the required distribution and servicing support. Additionally, the agreements governing our current relationships allow for termination by our partners under certain circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. If any of our current strategic partners were to terminate any of its agreements with us, there could be a material adverse impact on the continued development and profitable commercialization of our products and the operation of our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.. Our purchase orders may not ship, be commissioned or installed, or convert to revenue.. Some of the orders we accept from customers require certain conditions or contingencies to be satisfied, or may be cancelled, prior to shipment or prior to commissioning or installation, some of which are outside of our control. Historically, shipments made against these orders have generally occurred between ninety days and twenty - four months from the date of acceptance of the order. Orders for the Company's products and services in 2017 approximated $285.0 million compared to total orders in 2016 of $280.0 million. The Company's backlog for products and services as of December 31, 2017 was in excess of $500.0 million, compared to the Company's backlog as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $380.0 million. The time periods from receipt of an order to shipment date and installation vary widely and are determined by a number of factors, including the terms of the customer contract and the customer's deployment plan. There may also be product redesign or modification requirements that must be satisfied prior to shipment of units under certain of our agreements. If the redesigns or modifications are not completed, some or all of our orders may not ship or convert to revenue. We publicly disclose anticipated, pending orders with prospective customers; however, those prospective customers may require certain conditions or contingencies to be satisfied prior to issuing a purchase order to. 12. Table of Contents. us, some of which are outside of our control. Such conditions or contingencies that may be required to be satisfied before we receive a purchase order may include, but are not limited to, successful product demonstrations or field trials. Converting orders into revenue is also dependent upon our customers' ability to obtain financing. Some conditions or contingencies that are out of our control may include, but are not limited to, government tax policy, government funding programs, and government incentive programs. Additionally, some conditions and contingencies may extend for several years. We may have to compensate customers, by either reimbursement, forfeiting portions of associated revenue, or other methods depending on the terms of the customer contract, based on the failure on any of these conditions or contingencies. While not probable, this could have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flow.. We are dependent on information technology in our operations and the failure of such technology may adversely affect our business.. We may experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems, that could adversely affect, or even temporarily disrupt, all or a portion of our operations until resolved. Inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings. Despite the implementation of network security measures, our information technology could be penetrated by outside parties (such as computer hackers or cyber terrorists) intent on extracting information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes. Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in a loss of assets or reputational damage. Additionally, any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws.. Our products use flammable fuels that are inherently dangerous substances.. Our fuel cell systems use hydrogen gas in catalytic reactions. While our products do not use this fuel in a combustion process, hydrogen gas is a flammable fuel that could leak and combust if ignited by another source. Further, while we are not aware of any significant accidents involving our products, any such accidents involving our products or other products using similar flammable fuels could materially suppress demand for, or heighten regulatory scrutiny of, our products.. The risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity is inherent in the development, manufacturing, marketing and sale of fuel cell products, including products fueled by hydrogen, a flammable gas. Any liability for damages resulting from malfunctions or design defects could be substantial and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, an actual or perceived problem could adversely affect the market's perception of our products resulting in a decline in demand for our products, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.. We are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks that could harm our business.. From time to time, we may be subject to contract disputes or litigation. In connection with any disputes or litigation in which we are involved, we may incur costs and expenses in connection with defending ourselves or in connection with the payment of any settlement or judgment or compliance with any ruling in connection therewith if there is an unfavorable outcome. The expense of defending litigation may be significant. The amount of time to resolve lawsuits is unpredictable and defending ourselves may divert management's attention from the day - to - day operations of our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. We may not be able to protect important intellectual property and we could incur substantial costs defending against claims that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of others.. PEM fuel cell technology was first developed in the 1950s, and fuel processing technology has been practiced on a large scale in the petrochemical industry for decades. Accordingly, we do not believe that we can establish a significant proprietary position in the fundamental component technologies in these areas. However, our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary system - level technologies, systems designs and manufacturing processes. We rely on patents, trademarks, and other policies and procedures related to confidentiality to protect our intellectual property. However, some of our intellectual property is not covered by any patent or patent application.. 13. Table of Contents. Moreover, we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will issue or, in the case of patents issued or to be issued, that the claims allowed are or will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or processes. Even if all of our patent applications are issued and are sufficiently broad, our patents may be challenged or invalidated. We could incur substantial costs in prosecuting or defending patent infringement suits or otherwise protecting our intellectual property rights. While we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights, we do not know whether we have been or will be completely successful in doing so. Moreover, patent applications filed in foreign countries may be subject to laws, rules and procedures that are substantially different from those of the United States, and any resulting foreign patents may be difficult and expensive to obtain and enforce. In addition, we do not know whether the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office will grant federal registrations based on our pending trademark applications. Even if federal registrations are granted to us, our trademark rights may be challenged. It is also possible that our competitors or others will adopt trademarks similar to ours, thus impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to customer confusion. We could incur substantial costs in prosecuting or defending trademark infringement suits.. Further, our competitors may independently develop or patent technologies or processes that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours. If we are found to be infringing third party patents, we could be required to pay substantial royalties and/or damages, and we do not know whether we will be able to obtain licenses to use such patents on acceptable terms, if at all. Failure to obtain needed licenses could delay or prevent the development, manufacture or sale of our products, and could necessitate the expenditure of significant resources to develop or acquire non - infringing intellectual property.. We may need to pursue lawsuits or legal action in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and domain names, and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. If third parties prepare and file applications for trademarks used or registered by us, we may oppose those applications and be required to participate in proceedings to determine the priority of rights to the trademark. Similarly, competitors may have filed applications for patents, may have received patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to products or technology that block or compete with ours. We may have to participate in interference proceedings to determine the priority of invention and the right to a patent for the technology. Litigation and interference proceedings, even if they are successful, are expensive to pursue and time consuming, and we could use a substantial amount of our management and financial resources in either case.. Confidentiality agreements to which we are party may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Our trade secrets may also be known without breach of such agreements or may be independently developed by competitors. Our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and processes could allow our competitors to limit or eliminate any competitive advantages we may have.. We face risks associated with our plans to market, distribute and service our products and services internationally.. We have begun to market, distribute, sell and service our product offerings internationally. We have limited experience operating internationally, including developing and manufacturing our products to comply with the commercial and legal requirements of international markets. Our success in international markets will depend, in part, on our ability and that of our partners to secure relationships with foreign sub - distributors, and our ability to manufacture products that meet foreign regulatory and commercial requirements. Additionally, our planned international operations are subject to other inherent risks, including potential difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights in foreign countries and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Also, to the extent our operations and assets are located in foreign countries, they are potentially subject to nationalization actions over which we will have no control.. For example, we operate in France under the name HyPulsion to develop and sell hydrogen fuel cell systems for the European material handling market. However, for the reasons discussed above, HyPulsion may not be able to accomplish its goals or become profitable.. Doing business in foreign markets requires us to be able to respond to rapid changes in market, legal, and political conditions in these countries. As we expand in international markets, we may face numerous challenges, including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, potential conflicts or disputes that countries may have to deal with, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, longer accounts receivable requirements and collections, difficulties in managing international operations, potentially adverse tax consequences, restrictions on repatriation of earnings and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of international laws. Any of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations. 14. Table of Contents. and financial condition. The success of our international expansion will depend, in part, on our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political environments.. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.. Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. We have devoted significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act of 2002. In addition, Section 404 under the Sarbanes - Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we assess the design and operating effectiveness of our controls over financial reporting. We are currently required to have our auditors attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our compliance with the annual internal control report requirement will depend on the effectiveness of our financial reporting and data systems and controls. Inferior internal controls increase the possibility of errors and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.. In addition, our internal control systems rely on people trained in the execution of the controls. Loss of these people or our inability to replace them with similarly skilled and trained individuals or new processes in a timely manner could adversely impact our internal control mechanisms.. Our future plans could be harmed if we are unable to attract or retain key personnel.. We have attracted a highly skilled management team and specialized workforce, including scientists, engineers, researchers, manufacturing, marketing and sales professionals. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified management and technical personnel. We do not know whether we will be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel. Our inability to hire qualified personnel on a timely basis, or the departure of key employees, could materially and adversely affect our development and profitable commercialization plans and, therefore, our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.. Potential future acquisitions could be difficult to integrate, divert the attention of key personnel, disrupt our business and impair our financial results.. As part of our business strategy, we intend to consider acquisitions of companies, technologies and products. Acquisitions, involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including, difficulty in integrating the technologies, products, operations and existing contracts of a target company and realizing the anticipated benefits of the combined businesses; difficulty in supporting and transitioning customers, if any, of the target company; inability to achieve anticipated synergies or increase the revenue and profit of the acquired business; potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; the price we pay or other resources that we devote may exceed the value we realize; or the value we could have realized if we had allocated the purchase price or other resources to another opportunity and inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted. As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions, and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate.. Our business may become subject to increased government regulation.. Our products are subject to certain federal, local, and non - U.S. laws and regulations, including, for example, state and local ordinances relating to building codes, public safety, electrical and gas pipeline connections, hydrogen transportation and siting and related matters. See \"Business - Government Regulations\" for additional information. Further, as products are introduced into the market commercially, governments may impose new regulations. We do not know the extent to which any such regulations may impact our ability to manufacture, distribute, install and service our products. Any regulation of our products, whether at the federal, state, local or foreign level, including any regulations relating to the production, operation, installation, and servicing of our products may increase our costs and the price of our products.. 15. Table of Contents. Provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may discourage or delay an acquisition of the Company by a third party that stockholders may consider favorable.. Our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and Delaware corporate law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include those that: authorize the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series without a stockholder vote; limit stockholders' ability to call special meetings; establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and provide for staggered terms for our directors.

Our primary sources of revenue are from sales of fuel cell systems and related infrastructure, services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure, Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), and fuel delivered to customers.  Revenue from sales of fuel cell systems and related infrastructure represents sales of our GenDrive units, GenSure stationary backup power units, as well as hydrogen fueling infrastructure. Revenue from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure represents revenue earned on our service and maintenance contracts and sales of spare parts.  Revenue from PPAs primarily represents payments received from customers who make monthly payments to access the Company's GenKey solution.  Revenue associated with fuel delivered to customers represents the sale of hydrogen to customers that has been purchased by the Company from a third party.. Revenue  -  sales of fuel cell systems and related infrastructure. Revenue from sales of fuel cell systems and related infrastructure represents revenue from the sale of our fuel cells, such as GenDrive units and GenSure stationary backup power units, as well as hydrogen fueling infrastructure referred to at the site level as hydrogen installations.. Revenue from sales of fuel cell systems and related infrastructure for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $31.3 million, or 78.3%, to $71.3 million from $40.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The main driver for the increased revenue was an increase in GenDrive deployment volume and infrastructure site increases, as well as pricing mix. There were 3,293 units recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 1,383 for the year ended December 31, 2016. An additional 1,785 units were shipped in 2017 and held as leased assets. As such, the Company will recognize revenue on these units over the life of the related PPA under \"Power Purchase Agreements\" in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Ten hydrogen installations occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017, for which the Company recognized revenue.  In addition, seven additional sites were constructed and held as leased assets. There were seven hydrogen installations for the year ended December 31, 2016, for which the Company recognized. 21. Table of Contents. revenue.  In addition, 11 additional sites were constructed and held as leased property during the year ended December 31, 2016.. Revenue from sales of fuel cell systems and related infrastructure for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $38.0 million, or 48.7%, to $40.0 million from $78.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company recognized revenue on 1,383 GenDrive units during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 3,634 during the year ended December 31, 2015.  An additional 2,605 units were deployed in 2016 and held as leased property because they were associated with sale/leaseback transactions accounted for as capital leases. Due to the growing PPA installed base, the Company will generate higher levels of revenue under \"Power Purchase Agreements\" in future periods. GenDrive units shipped in 2016 were predominantly associated with the GenKey solution. Revenue was also recognized for hydrogen installations at seven sites in 2016, compared to 18 sites in 2015. An additional 11 sites were deployed in 2016 and held as leased property.. Revenue  -  services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure.  Revenue from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure represents revenue earned on our service and maintenance contracts and sales of spare parts.  At December 31, 2017, there were 11,296 fuel cell units and 40 hydrogen installations under extended maintenance contracts, an increase from 8,950 and 8,655 fuel cell units and 30 and 23 hydrogen installations at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.. Revenue from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $2.3 million, or 11.3%, to $22.8 million from $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in service revenues was due to the increase in units under service contracts. The revenue increase was not as significant as the increase in number of units under service contracts mainly due to deployments that occurred later in 2017 and, therefore, did not earn or only partially earned service revenue for 2017 as well as the occurrence of slightly less billable incidents and nonrecurring revenue. The average number of units under extended maintenance contracts in 2017 was 9,889, compared to 8,933 in 2016. This 10.7% increase in average units serviced throughout the year is corresponding with the increase in revenue, as compared to the prior years.. Revenue from services performed on fuel cell systems and related infrastructure for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $6.4 million, or 46.0%, to $20.5 million from $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in this revenue category is primarily related to the Company's increase in sales of fuel cell systems and hydrogen installations in recent years, which has had a corresponding impact on the installed base.  The average number of units under extended maintenance contracts in 2016 was 8,933, compared to 6,986 in 2015. This 27.8% increase in average units serviced throughout the year is corresponding with the increase in revenue, as compared to the prior years.  The extent of the revenue increase, as compared to the unit increase, is due to improved customer pricing mix.. Revenue  -  Power Purchase Agreements.  Revenue from PPAs represents payments received from customers for power generated through the provision of equipment and service.  The equipment and service can be associated with sale/leaseback transactions in which the Company sells fuel cell systems and related infrastructure to a third-party, leases them back and operates them at customers' locations who are parties to PPAs with the Company.  Alternatively, the Company can retain the equipment as leased property and provide it to customers under PPAs.  At December 31, 2017, there were 33 GenKey sites associated with PPAs, as compared to 25 at December 31, 2016 and 14 at December 31, 2015.. Revenue from Power Purchase Agreements for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $6.6 million, or 48.2%, to $20.3 million from $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is due to the increased number of sites the Company has deployed with these types of arrangements. The average number of sites under PPA arrangements was 30 in 2017, as compared to 21 in 2016.. Revenue from Power Purchase Agreements for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $8.0 million or 139.4%, to $13.7 million from $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is due to the increased numbers of sites the Company has deployed with these types of arrangements. The average number of sites under PPA arrangements was 21 in 2016, as compared to 10 in 2015.. Revenue  -  fuel delivered to customers.  Revenue associated with fuel delivered to customers represents the sale of hydrogen to customers that has been purchased by the Company from a third party.  As part of the GenKey solution, the Company contracts with fuel suppliers to purchase liquid hydrogen, which is then sold to its customers.  At December 31, 2017, there were 58 sites associated with fuel contracts, as compared to 40 at December 31, 2016 and 22 at December. 22. Table of Contents. 31, 2015.  The sites generally are the same as those which had purchased hydrogen installations within the GenKey solution.. Revenue associated with fuel delivered to customers for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $7.4 million, or 67.7%, to $18.3 million from $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenue is due to an increase of sites taking fuel deliveries in 2017, compared to 2016.  The average number of sites receiving fuel deliveries was 50 in 2017, as compared to 33 in 2016.. Revenue associated with fuel delivered to customers for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $5.8 million, or 115.1%, to $10.9 million from $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in revenue is due to an increase of 18 additional sites taking fuel deliveries in 2016, compared to 2015. The average number of sites receiving fuel deliveries was 33 in 2016, as compared to 14 in 2015.. Revenue   -   other.  Other revenue primarily represents cost reimbursement research and development contracts associated with the development of PEM fuel cell technology. We generally share in the cost of these programs with our cost - sharing percentages ranging from 30% to 50% of total project costs. Revenue from time and material contracts is recognized on the basis of hours expended plus other reimbursable contract costs incurred during the period. We expect to continue certain research and development contract work that is related to our current product development efforts. Other miscellaneous revenue is recognized from time to time.. Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $0.6 million, or 67.9%, to $0.3 million from $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company's other revenue was associated with a research & development project with the European Union. The Company had no revenue associated with a customer stack development program, which resulted in $0.4 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.. Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $0.4 million, or 83.8%, to $0.9 million from $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. During 2016, the Company recorded $0.4 million in technology access fees from a customer related to stacks being developed internally as compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company has also been working on a U.S. government-related research and development project as it did in prior years, and had research & development activities related to a European Union related contract.. Revenue  -  provision for common stock warrants.  In 2017, in separate transactions, the Company issued to each of Amazon.com, Inc. (\"Amazon\") and  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (\"Walmart\") warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock.  The Company records a portion of the estimated fair value of the warrants as a reduction of revenue based upon the projected number of shares of common stock expected to vest under the warrants, the proportion of purchases by Amazon, Walmart and their affiliates within the period relative to the aggregate purchase levels required for vesting of the respective warrants, and the then-current fair value of the warrants. The amount of provision for common stock warrants recorded as a reduction of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $17.3 million for Amazon and $12.4 million for Walmart.. Cost of revenue  -  sales of fuel cell systems and related infrastructure.

Accordingly, $6.7 million (the fair value of the first tranche of Amazon Warrant Shares) was recognized as selling, general and administrative expense on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.  The second tranche of 29,098,260 Amazon Warrant Shares will vest in four installments of 7,274,565 Amazon Warrant Shares each time Amazon or its affiliates, directly or indirectly through third parties, make an aggregate of $50.0 million in payments for goods and services to the Company, up to payments totaling $200.0 million in the aggregate. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the first installment of the second tranche vested. The exercise price for the first and second tranches of Amazon Warrant Shares is $1.1893 per share.

The Amazon Warrant is exercisable through April 4, 2027.. The Amazon Warrant provides for net share settlement that, if elected by the holders, will reduce the number of shares issued upon exercise to reflect net settlement of the exercise price.

To the extent that projections change in the future as to the number of Amazon Warrant Shares that will vest, as well as changes in the fair value of the Amazon Warrant Shares, a cumulative catch-up adjustment will be recorded in the period in which the estimates change.. At December 31, 2017, 13,094,217 of the Amazon Warrant Shares had vested.

On December 23, 2016, the Company, and its subsidiaries Emerging Power Inc. and Emergent Power Inc. entered into a loan and security agreement with NY Green Bank, a Division of the New York State Energy Research & Development Authority (NY Green Bank), pursuant to which NY Green Bank made available to the Company a secured term loan facility in the amount of $25.0 million, subject to certain terms and conditions.  The Company borrowed $25.0 million upon closing and incurred costs of $1.2 million.  On July 21, 2017, the Company and NY Green Bank entered into an amendment to the loan and security agreement (as amended, Term Loan Facility), which among other things, provided for an additional $20.0 million term loan, increasing the size of the total commitment to $45.0 million, amended the interest rate, prepayment penalty (for any prepayment in the calendar year 2017 or 2018, a prepayment charge equal to 7.5% of the advance amount being prepaid will apply) and product deployment and employment targets.  As with the prior facility, the new facility will be repaid primarily as the Company's various restricted cash reserves are released over the term of the facility. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company borrowed the additional $20.0 million under the facility and incurred closing costs of $0.5 million. At December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal balance under the Term Loan Facility was $32.8 million.  The fair value of the Term Loan Facility approximates the carrying value as of December 31, 2017, due to the variable interest rate of the Term Loan Facility.. Advances under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of (i) the LIBOR rate for the applicable interest period, plus applicable margin of 9.5%. The interest rate at December 31, 2017 was approximately 10.8%.  The Term Loan Facility has a maturity date of December 23, 2019.  As of December 31, 2017, estimated remaining principal payments will be approximately $19.1 million and $13.7 million during the years ending December 31, 2018, and 2019, respectively.  These payments will be funded by restricted cash released, as described in Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies.. Interest and a varying portion of the principal amount is payable on a quarterly basis and the entire then outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan Facility, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, is due and payable on the maturity date.  On the maturity date, the Company may also be required to pay additional fees of up to $1.8 million if the Company is unable to meet certain goals related to the deployment of fuel cell systems in the State of New York and increasing the Company's number of full-time employees in the State of New York.. The Term Loan Facility is secured by substantially all of the Company's and the guarantor subsidiaries' assets, including, among other assets, all intellectual property, all securities in domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the securities in foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions and exclusions.. The Term Loan Facility contains covenants, including, among others, (i) the provision of annual and quarterly financial statements, management rights and insurance policies and (ii) restrictions on incurring debt, granting liens, making acquisitions, making loans, paying dividends, dissolving, and entering into leases and asset sales.  The Term Loan Facility also provides for events of default, including, among others, payment, bankruptcy, covenant, representation and warranty, change of control, judgment and material adverse effect defaults at the discretion of the lender.. The Term Loan Facility provides that if there is an event of default due to the Company's insolvency or if the Company fails to perform, in any material respect, the servicing requirements for fuel cell systems under certain customer agreements, which failure would entitle the customer to terminate such customer agreement, replace the Company or withhold the payment of any material amount to the Company under such customer agreement, then the NY Green Bank has the right to cause a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company to replace the Company in performing the maintenance services under such customer agreement.. 30.

During 2017, 2,611 shares of the Company's Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \"Series C Preferred Stock\") were converted to common stock.

Under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 382, the use of loss carryforwards may be limited if a change in ownership of a company occurs. If it is determined that due to transactions involving the Company's shares owned by its 5 percent or greater shareholders a change of ownership has occurred under the provisions of IRC Section 382, the Company's federal and state net operating loss carryforwards could be subject to significant IRC Section 382 limitations.. Based on studies of the changes in ownership of the Company, it has been determined that an IRC Section 382 ownership change occurred in 2013 that limited the amount of pre-change net operating losses that can be used in future years to $13.5 million.  Net operating losses of $152.4 million incurred after the most recent ownership change are not subject to IRC Section 382 and are available for use in future years.  Accordingly, the Company's deferred tax assets include $165.9 million of U.S. net operating loss carryforwards.  The net operating loss carryforwards available at December 31, 2017, if unused will expire at various dates from 2032 through 2037.. Approximately $1.4 million of research credit carryforwards generated after the most recent IRC Section 382 ownership change are included in the Company's deferred tax assets. Due to limitations under IRC Section 382, research credit carryforwards existing prior to the most recent IRC Section 382 ownership change will not be used and are not reflected in the Company's gross deferred tax asset at December 31, 2017.  The remaining credit carryforwards will expire during the periods 2033 through 2037.. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\") was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective for the 2018 tax year.  Accordingly, federal deferred tax assets were adjusted by $42.5 million to reflect the reduction in tax rates and the valuation allowance was also reduced by $42.5 million resulting in no change to the net deferred tax asset.  The deferred tax asset adjustments reduced the tax benefit of the current year losses by 33.5% as shown in the effective tax rate schedule.  The valuation allowance rate impact includes an offsetting 33.5% for the tax rate reduction resulting in no change to the provision for income taxes.. The Act also requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated foreign earnings and profits from foreign subsidiaries.

(A) \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe Company has several non - cancelable operating leases that generally expire over the next six years, primarily associated with sale/leaseback transactions and are secured with restricted cash. In addition, under a limited number of arrangements, the Company provides its products and services to customers in the form of a PPA that generally have six year terms. The Company accounts for these non - cancelable sale/leaseback transactions as operating leases in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Subtopic 840 - 40, Leases - Sale/Leaseback Transactions. See Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail.. (B) \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe Company has purchase obligations related to inventory build to meet its sales plan, stack and stack components for new units and servicing existing ones, and the maintenance of its building and storage of documents.. (C) \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company received cash for future services to be performed associated with certain sale/leaseback transactions, which was treated as a finance obligation. In addition, the Company has a finance obligation related to a sale/leaseback transaction involving its building. These obligations are secured with restricted cash. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company entered into a series of project financings, which are accounted for as capital leases and reported as part of the finance obligations on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.. (D) \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 (and amended during the year ended December 31, 2017), the Company entered into a long-term debt agreement with NY Green Bank.  Principal and interest payments will be made using the proceeds from the release of restricted cash.. Critical Accounting Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and related disclosures requires management to make estimates and assumptions.. We believe that the following are our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions the Company must make in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures:. Revenue Recognition:  The Company recognizes revenue under arrangements for products and services, which may include the sale of products and related services, including revenue from installation, service and maintenance, spare parts, hydrogen fueling services (which may include hydrogen supply as well as hydrogen fueling infrastructure) and leased units. The Company also recognizes revenue under research and development contracts, which are primarily cost reimbursement contracts associated with the development of PEM fuel cell technology.. The Company enters into revenue arrangements that may contain a combination of fuel cell systems and infrastructure, installation, service, maintenance, spare parts, and other support services. Revenue arrangements containing fuel cell systems and related infrastructure may be sold, or provided to customers under a PPA.. When sold to customers, the Company accounts for each separate deliverable of these multiple deliverable arrangements as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis. The Company considers a deliverable to have standalone value if the item is sold separately by us or another entity or if the item could be resold by the customer. The Company allocates revenue to each separate deliverable based on its relative selling price. For a majority of our deliverables, the Company determines relative selling prices using its best. 32. Table of Contents. estimate of the selling price since vendor-specific objective evidence and third-party evidence is generally not available for the deliverables involved in its revenue arrangements due to a lack of a competitive environment in selling fuel cell technology. When determining estimated selling prices, the Company considers the Company's ongoing pricing strategy and policies, the cost to produce the deliverable, a reasonable gross margin on that deliverable, the selling price and profit margin for similar products and services, the value of any enhancements that have been built into the deliverable and the characteristics of the varying markets in which the deliverable is sold, as applicable. The Company determines estimated selling prices for deliverables in its arrangements based on the specific facts and circumstances of each arrangement and analyzes the estimated selling prices used for its allocation of consideration of each arrangement.. Once relative selling prices are determined, the Company proportionately allocates the sale consideration to each element of the arrangement. The allocated sales consideration related to fuel cell systems and infrastructure, spare parts, and hydrogen infrastructure is recognized as revenue at shipment if title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the sales price is fixed or determinable, collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured, and customer acceptance criteria, if any, have been successfully demonstrated. The allocated sales consideration related to service and maintenance is generally recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, as appropriate.. For those customers who do not purchase an extended maintenance contract, the Company does not include a right of return on its products other than rights related to standard warranty provisions that permit repair or replacement of defective goods. The Company accrues for anticipated standard warranty costs at the same time that revenue is recognized for the related product.  Only a limited number of fuel cell units are under standard warranty.. In a vast majority of its commercial transactions, the Company sells extended maintenance contracts that generally provide for a five to ten year warranty from the date of product installation. These types of contracts are accounted for as a separate deliverable, and accordingly, revenue generated from these transactions is deferred and recognized in income over the warranty period, generally on a straight-line basis. Additionally, the Company may enter into annual service and extended maintenance contracts that are billed monthly. Revenue generated from these transactions is recognized in income on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Costs are recognized as incurred over the term of the contract.  When costs are projected to exceed revenues on the life of the contract, an accrual for loss contracts is recorded.  Costs are estimated based upon historical experience, contractual agreements and the estimated impact of the Company's cost reduction initiatives.  The actual results may differ from these estimates.. When fuel cell systems and related infrastructure are provided to customers through a Power Purchase Agreement, or PPA, revenues associated with these agreements are treated as rental income and recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the agreements.  In conjunction with entering into a PPA with a customer, the Company may enter into sale/leaseback transactions with third-party financial institutions, whereby the fuel cells, related infrastructure, and service are sold to the third-party financial institution and leased back to the Company through either an operating or capital lease.. The Company purchases hydrogen fuel from suppliers and sells to its customers upon delivery.  Revenue and cost of revenue related to this fuel is recorded as dispensed, and included in the respective \"Fuel delivered to customers\" lines on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.. One of the critical estimates that management makes is the projection of service costs related to GenDrive units under extended maintenance contracts. This estimate is important in management's determination of whether a loss contract exists, as well as the amount of any loss. When projected costs to be incurred over the remaining life of the extended maintenance contracts is estimated to exceed contractual revenues, a provision for loss contracts related to service is recorded. An analysis of projected expenses and revenues is performed on each extended maintenance contract. Cost of expected maintenance contracts consist of replacement parts, labor and overhead. A variety of assumptions are included in the estimates of future service costs, including the life of parts, failure rates of parts, and future costs of parts.. Contract accounting is used for research and development contract revenue. The Company generally shares in the cost of these programs with cost sharing percentages ranging from 30% to 50% of total project costs. Revenue from time and material contracts is recognized on the basis of hours expended plus other reimbursable contract costs incurred during the period and is included within the \"other\" revenue line on the consolidated statement of operations. All allowable work performed through the end of each calendar quarter is billed, subject to limitations in the respective contracts. We. 33. Table of Contents. expect to continue research and development contract work that is directly related to our current product development efforts.. Valuation of long - lived assets:  We assess the potential impairment of long - lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsignificant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsignificant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsignificant negative industry or economic trends;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsignificant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour market capitalization relative to net book value.. When we determine that the carrying value of long - lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we would measure any impairment based upon the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC No. 350 - 35 - 30 - 14, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, and FASB ASC No. 360 - 10 - 35 - 15, Impairment or Disposal of Long - Lived Assets, as appropriate. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.. Warrant Accounting:    The Company accounts for common stock warrants as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the respective warrant agreements, as follows:. Derivative Liabilities. Registered common stock warrants that require the issuance of registered shares upon exercise and do not sufficiently preclude an implied right to cash settlement are accounted for as derivative liabilities. We currently classify these derivative warrant liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a long-term liability, which is revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to the initial issuance, using the Black-Scholes pricing model. This pricing model, which is based, in part, upon unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, requires the Company to develop its own assumptions. Changes in the fair value of the warrants are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as change in fair value of common stock warrant liability.. There was no expected dividend yield for the warrants granted. If factors change and different assumptions are used, the warrant liability and the change in estimated fair value could be materially different. Generally, as the market price of our common stock increases, the fair value of the warrant increases, and conversely, as the market price of our common stock decreases, the fair value of the warrant decreases. Also, a significant increase in the volatility of the market price of the Company's common stock, in isolation, would result in a significantly higher fair value measurement; and a significant decrease in volatility would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. Changes in the fair value of the warrants are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as change in fair value of common stock warrant liability.. Equity Instruments. Common stock warrants that meet certain applicable requirements of ASC Subtopic 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging  -  Contracts in Entity's Own Equity, and other related guidance, including the ability of the Company to settle the warrants without the issuance of registered shares or the absence of rights of the holder to require cash settlement, are accounted for as equity instruments. The Company classifies these equity instruments within additional paid-in capital on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Common stock warrants accounted for as equity instruments represent the warrants issued to Amazon.com, Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.  These warrants are remeasured at each financial reporting date prior to vesting, using the Monte Carlo pricing model.  Once these warrants vest, they are no longer remeasured.  This pricing model, which is based, in part, upon unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, requires the Company to develop its own assumptions. Changes in fair value resulting from remeasurement of common stock warrants. 34. Table of Contents. issued in connection with the Amazon Transaction Agreement and the Walmart Transaction Agreement are recorded as cumulative catch up adjustments as a reduction of revenue.. There was no expected dividend yield for the warrants granted.. Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In July 2017, an accounting update was issued to address narrow issues identified as a result of the complexity associated with applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. This update addresses the complexity of accounting for certain financial. instruments with down round features. Down round features are features of certain equity-linked instruments (or embedded features) that result in the strike price being reduced on the basis of the pricing of future equity offerings. The Company early adopted this accounting update during the three months ended June 30, 2017. The adoption of this accounting update was considered in determining that warrants issued during the second quarter of 2017 were equity classified.. In January 2017, an accounting update was issued to simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.  Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. This accounting update is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2019.  Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company is evaluating the impact this update will have on the consolidated financial statements.. In November 2016, an accounting update was issued to reduce the existing diversity in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. This accounting update is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years and is required to be adopted retrospectively. The Company expects adoption of this update to impact cash flows from financing activities due to the change in the presentation of its restricted cash balance on the consolidated financial statements.    Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities and decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, are expected to (decrease) increase by ($11.4 million), $6.8 million, and $47.3 million, respectively.. In October 2016, an accounting update was issued to simplify how an entity should recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.  Consequently, the amendments in this update eliminate the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory.  Two common examples of assets included in the scope of this update are intellectual property and property, plant, and equipment.  This accounting update is effective for the annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those years. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements.. In August 2016, an accounting update was issued to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  This accounting update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  The Company is evaluating the impact this update will have on the consolidated financial statements.. In March 2016, an accounting update was issued to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  This accounting update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those periods.  The Company adopted this update and it did not have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements.. In February 2016, an accounting update was issued which requires balance sheet recognition for operating leases, among other changes to previous lease guidance.  This accounting update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.  While the Company is evaluating the impact this update will have on the consolidated financial statements, it is expected that the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable leases, as lessee, will be recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheets, offset by a right-of-use asset.. 35. Table of Contents. In June 2014, an accounting update was issued that replaces the existing revenue recognition framework regarding contracts with customers. The Company adopted this accounting update as of January 1, 2018. The standard outlines a five-step model whereby revenue is recognized as performance obligations within a contract are satisfied. The standard also requires new, expanded disclosures regarding revenue recognition. The Company will use the modified retrospective basis method to account for the transition. The Company did not experience a significant effect on the timing and amount of revenue recognized or the amount of revenue allocated to the identified performance obligations. There is an insignificant amount of historical contract acquisition costs that were expensed under current guidance and will not be capitalized upon adoption of ASC Subtopic 606.
