[1] "Item 1A.  Risk Factors. Our results of operations and revenues may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including cyclical changes in the insurance industry, which may cause the price of our securities to be volatile.. The results of operations of companies in the property and casualty insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties. Our profitability can be affected significantly by:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCompetitive pressures impacting our ability to write new business or retain existing business at an adequate rate,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRising levels of loss costs that we cannot anticipate at the time we price our coverages,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tVolatile and unpredictable developments, including man-made, weather-related and other natural CATs, terrorist attacks or significant price changes of the commodities we insure,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in the level of reinsurance capacity,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in the amount of losses resulting from new types of claims and new or changing judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers' liabilities and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe ability of our underwriters to accurately select and price risk and our claim personnel to appropriately deliver fair outcomes.. In addition, the demand for property and casualty insurance, both admitted and excess and surplus lines, can vary significantly, rising as the overall level of economic activity increases and falling as that activity decreases, causing our revenues to fluctuate. These fluctuations in results of operations and revenues may not reflect long-term results and may cause the price of our securities to be volatile.. Adverse changes in the economy could lower the demand for our insurance products and could have an adverse effect on the revenue and profitability of our operations.. Factors such as business revenue, construction spending, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets and inflation can all affect the business and economic environment. These same factors affect our ability to generate revenue and profits. Insurance premiums in our markets are heavily dependent on our customer revenues, values transported, miles traveled and number of new projects initiated. In an economic downturn that is characterized by higher unemployment, declines in construction spending and reduced corporate revenues, the demand for insurance products is adversely affected. Adverse changes in the economy may lead our customers to have less need for insurance coverage, to cancel existing insurance policies, to modify coverage or to not renew with us, all of which affect our ability to generate revenue.. Catastrophic losses, including those caused by natural disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes, or man-made events such as terrorist attacks, are inherently unpredictable and could cause us to suffer material financial losses.. We face the risk of property damage resulting from catastrophic events, particularly earthquakes on the West Coast and hurricanes and tropical storms affecting the continental U.S. or Hawaii. Since the Northridge, California earthquake in 1994,. 23. Table of Contents. most of our catastrophe-related claims have resulted from hurricanes and other seasonal storms such as tornadoes and hail storms.. The incidence and severity of CATs are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from a CAT is a function of both the total amount of insured values in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Most CATs are restricted to fairly specific geographic areas. However, hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in large, heavily populated areas. In addition to hurricanes and earthquakes, CAT losses can be due to windstorms, severe winter weather and fires and may include terrorist events. In addition, climate change could have an impact on longer-term natural CAT trends. Extreme weather events that are linked to rising temperatures, changing global weather patterns, sea, land and air temperatures, as well as sea levels, rain and snow could result in increased occurrence and severity of CATs. CATs can cause losses in a variety of our property and casualty segments, and it is possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could cause us to suffer material financial losses. In addition, CAT claim costs may be higher than we originally estimate and could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year. Our ability to write new business could also be affected. We believe that increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property, the effects of inflation and the growth of our workers' compensation business could also increase the severity of claims from CAT events in the future.. For information on our approaches to catastrophe risk mitigation, including reinsurance and catastrophe modeling, see the Property Reinsurance  -  Catastrophe Coverage section within \"Item 1. Business\" and Note 1.S to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. However, since our CAT models cannot contemplate all possible CAT scenarios and includes underlying assumptions based on a limited set of actual events, the losses we might incur from an actual catastrophe could be higher than our expectation of losses generated from modeled catastrophe scenarios and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.. Our loss reserves are based on estimates and may be inadequate to cover our actual insured losses, which would negatively impact our profitability.. Significant periods of time often elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of that loss. To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses, we establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported losses and the related loss adjustment expenses. Loss reserves are estimates of the ultimate cost of claims and do not represent an exact calculation of liability. These estimates are based on historical information and on estimates of future trends that may affect the frequency and severity of claims that may be reported in the future. Estimating loss reserves is a difficult, complex and inherently uncertain process involving many variables and subjective judgments. As part of the reserving process, we review historical data and consider the impact of various factors such as:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tLoss emergence and cedant reporting patterns,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tUnderlying policy terms and conditions,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tBusiness and exposure mix,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tTrends in claim frequency and severity,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in operations,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tEmerging economic and social trends,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tInflation and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in the regulatory and litigation environments.. This process assumes that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future events. It also assumes that adequate historical or other data exists upon which to make these judgments. For more information on the estimates used in the establishment of loss reserves, see the loss and settlement expenses section of our critical accounting policies contained within Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. However, there is no precise method for evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves and actual results are likely to differ from original estimates. If the actual amount of insured losses is greater than the amount we have reserved for these losses, our profitability could suffer.. 24. Table of Contents. We may suffer losses from litigation, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.. As is typical in our industry, we continually face risks associated with litigation of various types, including general commercial and corporate litigation, and disputes relating to bad faith allegations which could result in us incurring losses in excess of policy limits. We are party to a variety of litigation matters throughout the year. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and if there were an outcome unfavorable to us, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position in the period in which the outcome occurs. Even if an unfavorable outcome does not materialize, we still may face substantial expense and disruption associated with the litigation.. Our reinsurers may not pay on losses in a timely fashion, or at all, which may increase our costs.. We purchase reinsurance to transfer part of the risk we have assumed (known as ceding) to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer, it does not relieve us (the reinsured) of our liability to our policyholders. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. That is, our reinsurers may not pay claims made by us on a timely basis, or they may not pay some or all of these claims for a variety of reasons. Either of these events would increase our costs and could have a materially adverse effect on our business.. If we cannot obtain adequate reinsurance protection for the risks we have underwritten, we may be exposed to greater losses from these risks or we may reduce the amount of business we underwrite, which will reduce our revenues.. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection that we purchase. In addition, the historical results of reinsurance programs and the availability of capital also affect the availability of reinsurance. Our reinsurance agreements are generally subject to annual renewal. We cannot be sure that we can maintain our current reinsurance protection, that we can obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates or that we can diversify our exposure among an adequate number of high quality reinsurance partners. If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities on terms we deem acceptable, either our net exposures would increase - which could increase the volatility of our results - or, if we were unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures, we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments, which would reduce our revenues.. Our investment results and, therefore, our financial condition may be impacted by changes in the business, financial condition or operating results of the entities in which we invest, as well as changes in interest rates, government monetary policies, general economic conditions, liquidity and overall market conditions.. We invest the premiums we receive from customers until they are needed to pay expenses or policyholder claims. Funds remaining after paying expenses and claims remain invested and are included in retained earnings. The value of our investment portfolio can fluctuate as a result of changes in the business, financial condition or operating results of the entities in which we invest. In addition, fluctuations can result from changes in interest rates, credit risk, government monetary policies, liquidity of holdings and general economic conditions. The equity portfolio will fluctuate with movements in the overall stock market. While the equity portfolio has been constructed to have lower downside risk than the market, the portfolio is positively correlated with movements in domestic stocks. The bond portfolio is affected by interest rate changes and movement in credit spreads. We attempt to mitigate our interest rate and credit risks by constructing a well-diversified portfolio of high-quality securities with varied maturities. These fluctuations may negatively impact our financial condition. However, we attempt to manage this risk through asset allocation, duration and security selection.. We compete with a large number of companies in the insurance industry for underwriting revenues.. We compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business. During periods of intense competition for premium (soft markets), we are vulnerable to the actions of other companies who may seek to write business without the appropriate regard for risk and profitability. During these times, it is very difficult to grow or maintain premium volume without sacrificing underwriting discipline and income.. We face competition both from specialty insurance companies, underwriting agencies and intermediaries, as well as diversified financial services companies that are significantly larger than we are and that have significantly greater financial, marketing, management and other resources. We may also face competition from new sources of capital such as institutional investors seeking access to the insurance market, sometimes referred to as alternative capital, which may depress pricing or limit our opportunities to write business. Some of these competitors also have greater experience and market recognition than. 25. Table of Contents. we do. We may incur increased costs in competing for underwriting revenues. If we are unable to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate or expand our operations into new markets, our underwriting revenues may decline, as well as overall business results.. A number of new, proposed or potential legislative or industry developments could further increase competition in our industry. These developments include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAn increase in capital-raising by companies in our lines of business, which could result in new entrants to our markets and an excess of capital in the industry,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe deregulation of commercial insurance lines in certain states and the possibility of federal regulatory reform of the insurance industry, which could increase competition from standard carriers for our excess and surplus lines of insurance business,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPrograms in which state-sponsored entities provide property insurance in CAT-prone areas or other \"alternative markets\" types of coverage,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanging practices, which may lead to greater competition in the insurance business and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe emergence of insurtech companies and the development of new technologies, which may lead to disruption of current business models and the insurance value chain.. New competition from these developments could cause the supply and/or demand for insurance or reinsurance to change, which could affect our ability to price our coverages at attractive rates and thereby adversely affect our underwriting results.. A downgrade in our ratings from A.M. Best, Standard & Poor's or Moody's could negatively affect our business.. Financial strength ratings are a critical factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Our insurance companies are rated for overall financial strength by A.M. Best, Standard & Poor's and Moody's. A.M. Best, Standard & Poor's and Moody's ratings reflect their opinions of our financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders, and are not evaluations directed to investors. Our ratings are subject to periodic review by such firms, and the criteria used in the rating methodologies is subject to change; as such, we cannot assure the continued maintenance of our current ratings. All of our ratings were reviewed during 2017. A.M. Best reaffirmed its \"A+, Superior\" rating for the combined entity of RLI Ins., Mt. Hawley and CBIC (group-rated). Standard & Poor's reaffirmed our \"A+, Strong\" rating for the group of RLI Ins. and Mt. Hawley. Moody's reaffirmed our group rating of \"A2, Good\" for RLI Ins. and Mt. Hawley. Because these ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies, if our ratings are reduced from their current levels by A.M. Best, Standard & Poor's or Moody's, our competitive position in the industry, and therefore our business, could be adversely affected. A significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business, as policyholders might move to other companies with higher claims-paying and financial strength ratings.. We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which may adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. Moreover, if we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including fines and suspensions, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and reputation.. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than shareholders and other investors. These regulations, generally administered by a department of insurance in each state and territory in which we do business, relate to, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tApproval of policy forms and premium rates,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tStandards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tLicensing of insurers and their producers,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRestrictions on agreements with our large revenue-producing agents,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCancellation and non-renewal of policies,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRestrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments,. 26. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRestrictions on the ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to pay dividends to us,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRestrictions on transactions between insurance company subsidiaries and their affiliates,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRestrictions on the size of risks insurable under a single policy,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRequiring deposits for the benefit of policyholders,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRequiring certain methods of accounting,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPeriodic examinations of our operations and finances,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPrescribing the form and content of records of financial condition required to be filed and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRequiring reserves for unearned premium, losses and other purposes.. State insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the conduct and affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual, quarterly and other reports relating to financial condition, holding company issues and other matters. These regulatory requirements may adversely affect or inhibit our ability to achieve some or all of our business objectives.. In addition, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to deny or revoke licenses for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. In some instances, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe may be generally followed by the industry. These practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, insurance regulatory authorities could fine us, preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us. This could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Further, changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities could adversely affect our ability to operate our business as currently conducted.. In addition to regulations specific to the insurance industry, including the insurance laws of our principal state regulator (Illinois), as a public company we are also subject to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), each of which regulate many areas such as financial and business disclosures, corporate governance and shareholder matters. We are also subject to the corporation laws of Illinois, where we and our three insurance company subsidiaries are incorporated. At the federal level, among other laws, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, each of which regulate corporate governance, executive compensation and other areas, as well as laws relating to federal trade restrictions, privacy/data security and terrorism risk insurance laws. We monitor these laws, regulations and rules on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance and make appropriate changes as necessary. Implementing such changes may require adjustments to our business methods, increases to our costs and other changes that could cause us to be less competitive in our industry.. We may be unable to attract and retain qualified key employees.. We depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers, experienced underwriting talent and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business. Providing suitable succession planning for such positions is also important. If we cannot attract or retain top-performing executive officers, underwriters and other employees, if the quality of their performance decreases or if we fail to implement succession plans for our key staff, we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the markets in which we operate or expand our operations into new markets.. We are an insurance holding company and therefore may not be able to receive adequate or timely dividends from our insurance subsidiaries.. RLI Corp. is the holding company for our three insurance operating companies. At the holding company level, our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries. We rely largely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt, corporate expenses and dividends to RLI Corp. shareholders. Dividend payments to RLI Corp. from our principal insurance subsidiary are restricted by state insurance laws as to the amount that may be paid without prior approval of the insurance regulatory authorities of Illinois. As a result, we may not be able to receive dividends from such subsidiary at times and in amounts necessary to pay RLI Corp. obligations and desired dividends to shareholders. Ordinary dividends, which may be paid by our principal insurance subsidiary without prior regulatory approval, are subject to certain limitations based upon income, surplus and earned surplus. The maximum ordinary dividend distribution from our principal insurance subsidiary in a rolling 12-month. 27. Table of Contents. period is limited by Illinois law to the greater of 10 percent of RLI Ins. policyholder surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year, or the net income of RLI Ins. for the 12-month period ending December 31 of the preceding year. Ordinary dividends are further restricted by the requirement that they be paid from earned surplus. Any dividend distribution in excess of the ordinary dividend limits is deemed extraordinary and requires prior approval (or non-disapproval) from the IDOI. Because the limitations are based upon a rolling 12-month period, the presence, amount and impact of these restrictions vary over time.. Anti-takeover provisions affecting us could prevent or delay a change of control that is beneficial to you.. Provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws, as well as applicable Illinois law, federal and state regulations and insurance company regulations may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, tender offer or other change of control that holders of our securities may consider favorable. Some of these provisions impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for shareholders to effect certain corporate actions. These provisions could:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tHave the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDiscourage bids for our securities at a premium over the market price,.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAdversely affect the market price, the voting and other rights of the holders of our securities or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tImpede the ability of the holders of our securities to change our management.. Any significant interruption in the operation of our facilities, systems and business functions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. We rely on multiple computer systems to interact with producers and customers, issue policies, pay claims, run modeling functions, assess insurance risks and complete various important internal processes including accounting and bookkeeping. Our business is highly dependent on our ability to access these systems to perform necessary business functions. Additionally, some of these systems may include or rely upon third-party systems not located on our premises. Any of these systems may be exposed to unplanned interruption, unreliability or intrusion from a variety of causes, including among others, storms and other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, utility outages or complications encountered as existing systems are replaced or upgraded.. Any such issues could materially impact our company including the impairment of information availability, compromise of system integrity/accuracy, misappropriation of confidential information, reduction of our volume of transactions and interruption of our general business. Although we believe our computer systems are securely protected and continue to take steps to ensure they are protected against such risks, we cannot guarantee that such problems will never occur. If they do, interruption to our business and damage to our reputation, and related costs, could be significant, which could impair our profitability.. Technology breaches or failures, including but not limited to cyber security incidents, could disrupt our operations and result in the loss of critical and confidential information, which could adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.. Global cyber security threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems and those of our business partners or service providers to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats. While we and our business partners and service providers employ measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of information technology networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems), cyber security incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of our or our customers' information, litigation and potential liability. In addition, cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy or other proper functioning of our technology systems could impact our operations. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent every type of cyber attack. A significant cyber incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations, result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers or give rise to monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant. It is possible that insurance coverage we have in place would not entirely protect us in the event that we experienced a cyber security incident, interruption or widespread failure of our information technology systems.. 28. Table of Contents. We rely on third party vendors for a number of key components of our business.. We contract with a number of third party vendors to support our business. For example, we have license agreements for services that include natural catastrophe modeling, policy management, claims processing, producer management and accounting and financial management. The vendors range from large national companies, who are dominant in their area of expertise and would be difficult to quickly replace, to smaller or start-up vendors with leading technology, but with shorter operating histories and less financial resources. Failures of certain vendors to provide services could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers, disrupting our business and causing us to incur significant expense. If one or more of our vendors fail to protect personal information of our customers, claimants or employees, we may incur operational impairments, or could be exposed to litigation, compliance costs or reputation damage. We maintain a vendor management program to establish procurement policies and to monitor vendor risk, including the financial stability of our critical vendors.. We may not be able to effectively start up or integrate new product opportunities.. Our ability to grow our business depends, in part, on our creation, implementation and acquisition of new insurance products that are profitable and fit within our business model. New product launches as well as resources to integrate business acquisitions are subject to many obstacles, including ensuring we have sufficient business and systems processes, determining appropriate pricing, obtaining reinsurance, assessing opportunity costs and regulatory burdens and planning for internal infrastructure needs. If we cannot accurately assess and overcome these obstacles or we improperly implement new insurance products, our ability to grow profitably will be impaired.. Access to capital and market liquidity may adversely affect our ability to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.. Our ability to grow our business depends in part on our ability to access capital when needed. We cannot predict capital market liquidity or the availability of capital. We also cannot predict the extent and duration of future economic and market disruptions, the impact of government interventions into the market to address these disruptions and their combined impact on our industry, business and investment portfolios. If our company needs capital but cannot raise it, our business and future growth could be adversely affected.. Our success will depend on our ability to maintain and enhance effective operating procedures and manage risks on an enterprise wide basis.. Operational risk and losses can result from, among other things, fraud, errors, failure to document transactions properly, failure to obtain proper internal authorization, failure to comply with regulatory requirements, information technology failures or external events. We continue to enhance our operating procedures and internal controls to effectively support our business and our regulatory and reporting requirements. The NAIC and state legislatures have increased their focus on risks within an insurer's holding company system that may pose enterprise risk to insurers. The Illinois legislature has adopted the Risk Management and ORSA Law, which requires domestic insurers to maintain a risk management framework and establishes a legal requirement for domestic insurers to conduct an ORSA in accordance with the NAIC's ORSA Guidance Manual. The ORSA law also provides that, no less than annually, an insurer must submit an ORSA summary report. Under the Illinois insurance holding company laws, on an annual basis, we are also required to file with the IDOI an enterprise risk report, which is intended to identify the material risks within our insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to our insurance company subsidiaries. We operate within an ERM framework designed to assess and monitor our risks. However, assurance that we can effectively review and monitor all risks or that all of our employees will operate within the ERM framework cannot be guaranteed. Assurances that our ERM framework will result in us accurately identifying all risks and accurately limiting our exposures based on our assessments also cannot be guaranteed.. We may not be able to, or might not choose to, continue paying dividends on our common stock.. We have a history of paying regular, quarterly dividends and in recent years have paid special dividends. Any determination to pay either type of dividend to our stockholders in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Our ability to pay dividends depends largely on our subsidiaries' earnings and operating capital requirements and is subject to the regulatory, contractual, and other constraints of our subsidiaries, including the effect of any such dividends or distributions on the A.M. Best rating or other ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. In addition, we may choose to retain capital to support growth or further mitigate risk, as opposed to returning excess capital to our shareholders.. 29.
