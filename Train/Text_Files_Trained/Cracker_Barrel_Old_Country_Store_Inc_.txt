[1] "ITEM 1A.                                          RISK FACTORS. Investing in our securities involves a degree of risk.  Persons buying our securities should carefully consider the         risks described below and the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings that we make from time to time with the SEC, including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  If any of the         following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In any such case, the trading price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of         your investment.. General economic, business and societal conditions as well as those specific to the restaurant or retail industries         that are largely out of our control may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our business results depend on a number of industry-specific and general economic factors, many of which are beyond our control.  These         factors include consumer income, interest rates, inflation, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. The full-service dining         sector of the restaurant industry and the retail industry are affected by changes in national, regional and local economic conditions, seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes, consumer preferences, including changes in consumer tastes and dietary         habits and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant concept and retail merchandise, and consumer spending patterns.. Discretionary consumer spending, which is critical to our success, is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of         discretionary income.  Global economic factors and a weak economic recovery may reduce consumer confidence and affected consumers' ability or desire to spend disposable income.  A deterioration in the economy or other economic conditions affecting         disposable consumer income, such as unemployment levels, reduced home values, investment losses, inflation, business conditions, fuel and other energy costs, consumer debt levels, lack of available credit, consumer confidence, interest rates, tax         rates and changes in tax laws, may adversely affect our business by reducing overall consumer spending or by causing customers to reduce the frequency with which they shop and dine out or to shift their spending to our competitors or to products         sold by us that are less profitable than other product choices, all of which could result in lower revenues, decreases in inventory turnover, greater markdowns on inventory, and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins.. 10. Table of Contents. In addition, many of the factors discussed above, along with the current economic environment and the related impact on available         credit, may affect us and our suppliers and other business partners, landlords, and customers in an adverse manner, including, but not limited to, reducing access to liquid funds or credit (including through the loss of one or more financial         institutions that are a part of our revolving credit facility), increasing the cost of credit, limiting our ability to manage interest rate risk, increasing the risk of bankruptcy of our suppliers, landlords or counterparties to or other financial         institutions involved in our revolving credit facility and our derivative and other contracts, increasing the cost of goods to us, and other adverse consequences which we are unable to fully anticipate.. We also cannot predict the effects of actual or threatened armed conflicts or terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, military         action against any foreign state or group located in a foreign state or heightened security requirements on the economy or consumer confidence in the United States.  Any of these events could also affect consumer sentiment and confidence that in         turn affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures.. Unfavorable changes in the factors described above or in other business and economic conditions affecting our customers could increase         our costs, reduce traffic in some or all of our locations or impose practical limits on pricing, any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. There can be no assurance that the economic conditions that have adversely affected the restaurant and retail industries, and the           capital, credit and real estate markets generally or us in particular will remain static in 2019, or thereafter, in which case we could experience declines in revenues and profits, and could face capital and liquidity constraints or other           business challenges.. A privacy breach could adversely affect our             business.. The protection of customer, employee and company data is critical to us.  We are subject to laws relating to information security,           privacy, cashless payments, consumer credit, and fraud.  Additionally, an increasing number of government and industry groups have established laws and standards for the protection of personal and health information. The regulatory environment           surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. Compliance with these requirements may result in cost increases due to necessary system changes and           the development of new administrative processes.  In addition, customers and employees have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. For example, in connection with credit and debit card sales, we transmit           confidential card information. Third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of this customer information, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prevent others from obtaining           improper access to this information. If we fail to comply with the laws and regulations regarding privacy and security or experience a security breach, we could be exposed to risks of data loss, regulatory investigations and/or penalties, a loss           of the ability to process credit and debit card payments, substantial inconvenience or harm to our guests, litigation and serious disruption of our operations.  Additionally, any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our           reputation and damage our relations with our guests.  As privacy and information security laws, regulations and practices change and cyber risks continue to evolve, we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance and protect           guest, employee and Company information.. Our reported results can be affected adversely and unexpectedly by the implementation of new, or changes in the         interpretation of existing, accounting principles or financial reporting requirements.. Our financial reporting complies with the United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), and GAAP is subject to change         over time.  If new rules or interpretations of existing rules require us to change our financial reporting (including the upcoming lease accounting changes), our reported results of operations and financial condition could be affected         substantially, including requirements to restate historical financial reporting.. 11. Table of Contents. We face intense competition, and if we are unable to continue to compete effectively, our business, financial         condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.. The restaurant and retail industries are intensely competitive, and we face many well-established competitors.  We compete within each         market with national and regional restaurant and retail chains and locally-owned restaurants and retailers.  Competition from other regional or national restaurant and retail chains typically represents the more important competitive influence,         principally because of their significant marketing and financial resources.  We also face competition as a result of the convergence of grocery, deli, retail and restaurant services, particularly in the supermarket industry.  We also face         competition from various off premise meal replacement offerings including, but not limited to, home meal kits delivery, third party meal delivery and catering and the rapid growth of these channels by our competitors. Moreover, our competitors can         harm our business even if they are not successful in their own operations by taking away customers or employees through aggressive and costly advertising, promotions or hiring practices.  We compete primarily on the quality, variety and perceived         value of menu and retail items. The number and location of stores, the growth of e-commerce, type of concept, quality and efficiency of service, attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs also are important         factors. We anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors.  We also compete with other restaurant chains and other retail businesses for quality site locations, management and hourly employees, and         competitive pressures could affect both the availability and cost of these important resources.  If we are unable to continue to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.. The price and availability of food, ingredients, retail merchandise, transportation, distribution and utilities used         by our stores could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.. We are subject to the general risks of inflation, and our operating profit margins and results of operations depend significantly on our         ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price, quality and availability of food and other commodities, ingredients, retail merchandise, transportation, distribution, utilities and other related costs over which we have limited control.          Fluctuations in economic conditions, weather, demand and other factors affect the availability, quality and cost of the ingredients and products that we buy.  Furthermore, many of the products that we use and their costs are interrelated.  Changes         in global demand for corn, wheat and dairy products could cause volatility in the feed costs for poultry and livestock. The effect of, introduction of, or changes to tariffs or exchange rates on imported retail products or food products could         increase our costs and possibly affect the supply of those products.  Changes in demand for over the road transportation and distribution services could cause volatility, increase our costs and affect our operating margins. In addition, food safety         concerns, widespread outbreaks of livestock and poultry diseases, such as, among other things, the Avian Flu, and product recalls, all of which are out of our control, and, in many instances, unpredictable, could also increase our costs and         possibly affect the supply of livestock and poultry products.  Our operating margins are also affected, whether as a result of general inflation or otherwise, by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as natural gas and electricity, on which         our locations depend for much of their energy supply.  Our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to one or more adverse changes in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations.  In addition,         because we provide a moderately-priced product, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our customers sufficient to completely offset cost increases.. 12. Table of Contents. Our plans depend significantly on our strategic priorities and business initiatives designed to enhance our menu and         retail offerings, support our brand, improve operating margins and improve the efficiencies and effectiveness of our operations.  Failure to achieve or sustain these plans could adversely affect our results of operations.. We have had, and expect to continue to have, priorities and initiatives in various stages of testing, evaluation and implementation,         upon which we expect to improve our results of operations and financial condition.  These priorities and initiatives include, but are not limited to, tiered menu and retail pricing, evolving our marketing messaging to support the brand, improving         the quality and breadth of retail assortments, evolving our menu, re-engineering store processes to reduce costs and improve store margins, applying technology to improve the employee and guest experience, expanding our store footprint, focusing on         our new fast casual concept, focusing on our off premise business and transactions such as joint ventures and acquisitions. It is possible that our focus on these priorities and initiatives and constantly changing consumer preferences could cause         unintended changes to our current results of operations. Additionally, many of these initiatives are inherently risky and uncertain in their application to our business in general, even when tested successfully on a more limited scale.  It is         possible that successful testing can result partially from resources and attention that cannot be duplicated in broader implementation. Testing and general implementation also can be affected by other risk factors described herein that reduce the         results expected. Successful system-wide implementation across hundreds of stores and involving tens of thousands of employees relies on consistency of training, stability of workforce, ease of execution and the absence of offsetting factors that         can adversely influence results. Failure to achieve successful implementation of our initiatives could adversely affect our results of operations.. Our annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of         investors and securities analysts due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, resulting either in volatility or a decline in the price of our securities.. Our business is not static  -  it changes periodically as a result of many factors, including, among other items discussed in other risk         factors, the following:.                                 increases and decreases in guest traffic, average weekly sales, restaurant and retail sales and restaurant profitability;.                                 the rate at which we open new stores, the timing of new store openings and the related high initial operating costs;.                                 changes in advertising and promotional activities and expansion into new markets; and.                                 impairment of long-lived assets and any loss on store closures.. Our quarterly operating results and restaurant and retail sales may fluctuate as a result of any of these or other factors.          Accordingly, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year, and restaurant and retail sales for any particular future period may decrease.  In the future, operating         results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors.  In such event, the price of our securities could fluctuate dramatically over time or could decrease generally.. 13. Table of Contents. Our reliance on certain significant vendors, particularly for foreign-sourced retail products, subjects us to         numerous risks, including possible interruptions in supply, which could adversely affect our business.. Our ability to maintain consistent quality throughout our operations depends in part upon our ability to acquire specified food and         retail products and supplies in sufficient quantities.  Partly because of our size, finding qualified vendors and accessing food, retail products, supplies and certain outsourced services in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge         that typically is more difficult with respect to goods or services sourced outside the United States.  In some cases, we may have only one supplier for a product or service.  Our dependence on single-source suppliers subjects us to the possible         risks of shortages, interruptions and price fluctuations, and possible litigation when we change vendors because of performance issues. Global economic factors and the weak economic recovery continue to put significant pressure on suppliers, with         some suppliers facing financial distress and others attempting to rebuild profitability, all of which tends to make the supply environment more expensive.  If any of these vendors is unable to fulfill its obligations, or if we are unable to find         replacement suppliers in the event of a supply disruption, we could encounter supply shortages and/or incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies, either of which could materially harm our business.. Additionally, we use a number of products that are or may be manufactured in a number of foreign countries.  In addition to the risk         presented by the possible long lead times to source these products, our results of operations may be materially affected by risks such as:.                                 fluctuating currency exchange rates or control regulations;.                                 foreign government regulations;.                                 product testing regulations;.                                 foreign political and economic instability;.                                 disruptions due to labor stoppages, strikes or slowdowns, or other disruptions, involving our vendors or the transportation and handling industries; and.                                 tariffs, trade barriers and other trade restrictions by the U.S. government on products or components shipped from foreign sources.. Possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items, retail merchandise and other supplies to our stores caused by inclement         weather, natural disasters such as droughts, floods and earthquakes, the inability of our vendors to obtain credit in a tightened credit market or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of the         items we buy and the operations of our stores.  Our inability to effectively manage supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our store operations.  If we temporarily close a store or         remove popular items from a store's menu or retail product assortment, that store may experience a significant reduction in revenue during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our customers changing their dining and         shopping habits.. 14. Table of Contents. Health concerns, government regulation relating to the consumption of food products and widespread infectious         diseases could affect consumer preferences and could negatively affect our results of operations.. The sale of food and prepared food products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to our customers.  Such injuries may         result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling and transportation         phases.  Additionally, many of the food items on our menu contain beef and chicken. The preferences of our customers toward beef and chicken could be affected by health concerns about the consumption of beef or chicken or health concerns and         publicity concerning food quality, illness and injury generally.  In recent years there has been publicity concerning E. coli bacteria, hepatitis A, \"mad cow\" disease, \"foot-and-mouth\" disease, salmonella, the bird/Avian Flu, peanut and other food         allergens, and other public health concerns affecting the food supply, including beef, chicken, pork, dairy and eggs.  In addition, if a regional or global health pandemic occurs, depending upon its location, duration and severity, our business         could be severely affected.  In the event a health pandemic occurs, customers might avoid public places, and local, regional or national governments might limit or ban public gatherings to halt or delay the spread of disease.  A regional or global         health pandemic might also adversely affect our business by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in our supply chain and by causing staffing shortages in our stores. In addition, government regulations or the         likelihood of government regulation could increase the costs of obtaining or preparing food products.  A decrease in guest traffic to our stores, a change in our mix of products sold or an increase in costs as a result of these health concerns         either in general or specific to our operations, could result in a decrease in sales or higher costs to our stores that would materially harm our business.. We are dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified employees while also controlling labor costs.. Our performance is dependent on attracting and retaining a large and growing number of qualified store employees.  Availability of staff         varies widely from location to location.  Many staff members are in entry-level or part-time positions, typically with high rates of turnover.  Even though recent trends in employee turnover have been favorable, if store management and staff         turnover were to increase, we could suffer higher direct costs associated with recruiting, training and retaining replacement personnel.  Management turnover as well as general shortages in the labor pool can cause our stores to be operated with         reduced staff, which negatively affects our ability to provide appropriate service levels to our customers.  Competition for qualified employees exerts upward pressure on wages paid to attract such personnel, resulting in higher labor costs,         together with greater recruiting and training expenses.. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, minimum wage         legislation, health care legislation, payroll taxes and changing demographics.  Many of our employees are hourly workers whose wages are affected by increases in the federal or state minimum wage or changes to tip credits.  Tip credits are the         amounts an employer is permitted to assume an employee receives in tips when the employer calculates the employee's hourly wage for minimum wage compliance purposes.  Increases in minimum wage levels and changes to the tip credit have been made and         continue to be proposed at both federal and state levels.  As minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage.  If         competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our profitability may decline.. 15. Table of Contents. If we fail to execute our business strategy, which includes our ability to find new store locations and open new         stores that are profitable, our business could suffer.. One of the means of achieving our growth objectives is opening and operating new and profitable stores. This strategy involves numerous         risks, and we may not be able to open all of our planned new stores and the new stores that we open may not be profitable or as profitable as our existing stores.. A significant risk in executing our business strategy is locating, securing and profitably operating an adequate supply of suitable new         store sites.  Competition for suitable store sites and operating personnel in our target markets is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to find sufficient suitable locations, or negotiate suitable purchase or lease terms,         for our planned expansion in any future period.  Recently, our target markets have been expanded to include markets that are outside of our existing core markets and in states where we currently do not have existing operations, which increases the         risk of executing our business strategy.  Economic conditions may also reduce commercial development activity and limited the availability of attractive sites for new stores.  New stores typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels         and operating margins normalize, and even sales at successful newly-opened stores generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation.  Our ability to open and operate new stores successfully also         depends on numerous other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, among other items discussed in other risk factors, the following:  our ability to control construction and development costs of new stores; our ability to manage         the local, state or other regulatory approvals and permits, zoning and licensing processes in a timely manner; our ability to appropriately train employees and staff the stores; consumer acceptance of our stores in new markets; and our ability to         manage construction delays related to the opening of a new store.  Delays or failures in opening new stores, or achieving lower than expected sales in new stores, or drawing a greater than expected proportion of sales in new stores from existing         stores, could materially adversely affect our business strategy and could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. Our risks are heightened because of our single retail           distribution facility and our potential inability or failure to execute on a comprehensive business continuity plan following a major disaster at or near our corporate facility could adversely affect our business.. The majority of our retail inventory is shipped into, stored at and shipped out of a single warehouse located in Lebanon, Tennessee.            All of the decorative fixtures used in our stores are shipped into, stored at and shipped out of a separate warehouse that is also located in Lebanon, Tennessee.  A natural disaster affecting either of these warehouses could materially adversely           affect our business.  Additionally, our corporate systems and processes and support for our restaurant and retail operations are centralized on one campus in Tennessee. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place           to address most events and back up and offsite locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information.  However, if we are unable to implement our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, we may experience delays in           recovery of data, failure to support field operations, tardiness in required reporting and compliance and the inability to perform vital corporate functions which could adversely affect our business.. 16. Table of Contents. A material disruption in our information             technology, network infrastructure and telecommunication systems could adversely affect our business and results of operations.. We rely extensively on our information technology across our operations, including, but not limited to, point of sales processing,           supply chain management, retail merchandise allocation and distribution, labor productivity and expense management   Our business depends significantly on the reliability, security and capacity of our information technology systems to process           these transactions, summarize results, manage and report on our business and our supply chain.  Our information technology systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer, network, cable system, Internet and           telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by our employees. If our information technology and           telecommunication systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we could suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our operations in the interim.            Any material interruption in our information technology and telecommunication systems could adversely affect our business or results of operations. In addition, some of these essential technology-based business systems are outsourced to third           parties.  While we make efforts to ensure that our outsourced providers are observing proper standards and controls, we cannot guarantee that breaches, disruptions or failures caused by these providers will not occur.. Our ability to manage our retail inventory levels and changes in merchandise mix may adversely affect our business.. The long lead times required for a substantial portion of our retail merchandise and the risk of product damages or non-compliance with         required specifications could affect the amount of inventory we have available for sale.  Additionally, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences for merchandise. If         we misjudge the market, we may overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant markdowns, which could reduce our gross margin.  Conversely, if we underestimate demand for our merchandise we may experience inventory shortages         resulting in lost revenues.  Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows from operations and our financial condition.. Our capital structure contains significant indebtedness, which may decrease our flexibility, increase our borrowing         costs and adversely affect our liquidity.  In addition, we cannot provide any guaranty of future cash dividend payments or that we will be able to actively repurchase our common stock pursuant to a share repurchase program.. Our consolidated indebtedness and our leverage ratio may have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to         changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs.  There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our revolving credit facility. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness         (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity.  A default under our credit agreement may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing.  For example, the lenders'         ongoing obligation to extend credit under the revolving credit facility is dependent upon our compliance with these covenants and restrictions.. Our ability to make scheduled interest payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our         operating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control.  Our inability to refinance our indebtedness when necessary or to do so upon         attractive terms would materially and adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.. In recent years, we have increased the quarterly cash dividends on our common stock and, beginning in 2015, we have also declared         special dividends on our common stock.  Any determination to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements and our Board of Directors'         conclusion that the declaration of cash dividends is in the best interest of our shareholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the payment of dividends.  Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to         actively repurchase our common stock and we may discontinue plans to repurchase common stock at any time.. 17. Table of Contents. Our advertising is heavily dependent on billboards, which are highly regulated; and our evolving marketing strategy         involves increased advertising and marketing costs that could adversely affect our results of operations.. Historically, we have relied upon billboards as our principal method of advertising.  A number of states in which we operate restrict         highway signage and billboards.  Because many of our stores are located on the interstate highway system, our business is highly related to highway travel. Thus, signage or billboard restrictions or loss of existing signage or billboards could         adversely affect our visibility and ability to attract customers.. Additionally, as we continue to evolve our marketing strategy, we are increasingly utilizing more traditional and higher cost methods of         advertising, such as national cable television, radio and online and digital media.  These types of advertising, their effects upon our revenues and, in turn, our profits, are uncertain.  Additionally, if our competitors increased their spending on         advertising and promotions, we could be forced to substantially increase our advertising, media or marketing expenses.  If we did so or if our current advertising and promotion programs become less effective, we could experience a material adverse         effect on our results of operations.. Our expansion into new geographic markets may present increased risks due to our relative unfamiliarity with these         markets.. Some of our new store locations may be located in areas where we have lower market presence and, as a result, less or no meaningful         business experience than in our traditional, existing markets. Those new markets may have different competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our traditional, existing markets, which may cause our new store         locations to be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets.  An additional risk of expanding into new markets is the potential for lower or lacking market awareness of our brand in those areas.  Stores opened in new markets may open         at lower average weekly sales volumes than stores opened in existing markets and may have higher store-level operating expense ratios than in existing markets.  Sales at stores opened in new markets may take longer to reach average unit volume and         margins, if at all, thereby affecting our overall profitability.. Unfavorable publicity could harm our business. In addition, our failure to recognize, respond to and effectively         manage the impact of social media could materially impact our business.. Multi-unit businesses such as ours can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from complaints or litigation alleging poor food         quality, poor service, food-borne illness, product defects, personal injury, adverse health effects (including obesity) or other concerns stemming from one or a limited number of our stores.  Even when the allegations or complaints are not valid,         unfavorable publicity relating to one or more of our stores, or only to a single store, could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand.  Additionally, negative publicity from online social network postings may also result from actual         or alleged incidents taking place in our stores.  Adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of food safety or customer service could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of         operations.. Our business is somewhat seasonal and also can be affected by extreme weather conditions and natural disasters.. Historically, our highest sales and profits have occurred during the second and fourth quarters, which include the holiday shopping         season and the summer vacation and travel season.  Retail sales historically have been seasonally higher between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Therefore, the results of operations for any quarter or period of less than one year cannot be considered         indicative of the operating results for an entire year.. 18. Table of Contents. Additionally, extreme weather conditions in the areas where our stores are located can adversely affect our business. For example,         frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rain storms, floods, droughts or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and can disrupt deliveries of food and         supplies to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability. Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather         during the summer season could render a portion of our retail inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions.  Reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weather conditions could adversely affect our business.  These risks may         be exacerbated in the future as some climatologists predict that the long-term effects of climate change may result in more severe, volatile weather.. In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes, or a combination of these or other factors, could           severely damage or destroy one or more of our stores, warehouses or suppliers located in the affected areas, thereby disrupting our business operations for a more extended period of time.. Individual store locations are affected by local conditions that could change and adversely affect the carrying value         of those locations.. The success of our business depends on the success of individual locations, which in turn depends on stability of or improvements in         operating conditions at and around those locations.  Our revenues and expenses can be affected significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new stores and the closing, relocating and remodeling of existing stores. We incur substantial         pre-opening expenses each time we open a new store and other expenses when we close, relocate or remodel existing stores. The expenses of opening, closing, relocating or remodeling any of our stores may be higher than anticipated.  An increase in         such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  Also, as demographic and economic patterns (e.g., highway or roadway traffic         patterns, concentrations of general retail or hotel activity, local population densities or increased competition) change, current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable.  Possible declines in neighborhoods where our stores are         located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced revenues in those locations.  The occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of         operations as well as the carrying value of our individual locations.. We are subject to a number of risks relating to federal, state and local regulation of our business, including the         areas of minimum wage increases, health care reform and environmental matters, and an insufficient or ineffective response to government regulation may increase our costs and decrease our profit margins.. The restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those relating to food safety,         minimum wage and other labor issues (such as unionization), health care, menu labeling and building and zoning requirements and those relating to the preparation and sale of food as well as certain retail products.  The development and operation of         our stores depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements.  We are also subject to licensing and regulation by         state and local authorities relating to health, sanitation, safety and fire standards, federal and state laws governing our relationships with employees (including the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of         1986, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and applicable requirements concerning minimum wage, overtime, healthcare coverage, family leave, medical privacy, tip credits, working         conditions, safety standards and immigration status), federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990.  In addition, we are         subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials.  We also face risks from new and changing laws and regulations relating to gift cards,         nutritional content, nutritional labeling, product safety and menu labeling. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.. 19. Table of Contents. Increases in state or federal minimum wage rates, including recent proposals to increase state or federal minimum wage rates and index         future increases to inflation, or other changes in these laws could increase our labor costs.  Our ability to respond to minimum wage increases by increasing menu prices will depend on the responses of our competitors and customers.  Our         distributors and suppliers also may be affected by higher minimum wage and benefit standards and tracking costs, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us.. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 require         restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie and nutritional information on their menus effective as of May 2018.  We cannot fully predict the long-term changes, if any, in guest behavior that could result from the implementation of this         provision, which could have an adverse effect on our sales or results of operations.. There also has been increasing focus by U.S. and foreign governmental authorities on environmental matters, such as climate change, the         reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption.  This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters, such as the emission of greenhouse gases.  Legislative, regulatory         or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in taxes, the cost of raw materials, transportation and utilities, which could decrease our operating profits and necessitate future         investments in facilities and equipment.. The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and         the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  Failure to comply with the laws         and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability.  Compliance with these laws and         regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.  Also, the failure to obtain and maintain required licenses, permits and approvals could adversely affect our operating results.          Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked, suspended or denied renewal for cause at any time if governmental authorities determine that our conduct violates applicable regulations, which could adversely affect our business and         results of operations.. Failure to maximize or to successfully assert our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business         and results of operations.. We rely on trademark, trade secret and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights.  We cannot guarantee that these         intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted.  There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own, or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights necessary to support new         product introductions or other brand extensions.  We cannot be sure that these rights, if obtained, will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future.  Our failure to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights         could make us less competitive and could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. We outsource certain business processes to           third-party vendors that subject us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs; our use of third party technologies has increased and           if we are unable to maintain our rights to these technologies our business may be harmed.. Some of our business processes are currently outsourced to third parties.  Such processes include distribution of food and retail         products to our store locations, credit and debit card authorization and processing, gift card tracking and authorization, employee payroll card services, health care and workers' compensation insurance claims processing, wage and related tax         credit documentation and approval, guest satisfaction survey programs, employee engagement surveys and externally hosted business software applications. We cannot ensure that all providers of outsourced services are observing proper internal         control practices, such as redundant processing facilities, and there are no guarantees that failures will not occur.  Failure of third parties to provide adequate services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of         operations.. 20. Table of Contents. We rely on certain technology licensed from third parties and may be required to license additional technology in the future for use in         managing our Internet sites and providing services to our guests and employees.  These third-party technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.  The inability to enter into and maintain these technology         licenses could adversely affect our business.. Litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, guests, suppliers, shareholders, governmental agencies, competitors or         others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation.  These actions and proceedings may involve allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, including wage and         hour violations and employment discrimination; guest discrimination; food safety issues, including poor food quality, food-borne illness, food tampering, food contamination, and adverse health effects from consumption of various food products or         high-calorie foods (including obesity); other personal injury; trademark and patent infringement; violation of the federal securities laws; or other concerns. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is         difficult to assess or quantify.  Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time.          The cost to defend future litigation may be significant.  There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease guest or consumer acceptance of our brand, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately         are found liable.  Litigation could adversely impact our operations and our ability to expand our brand in other ways as well.  As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. The loss of key executives or difficulties in recruiting           and retaining qualified personnel could jeopardize our future growth and success.. We have assembled a senior management team which has substantial background and experience in the restaurant and retail industries.            Our future growth and success depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our senior management and other key personnel, and we design our compensation programs to attract and retain key personnel and facilitate our ability to           develop effective succession plans.  If we fail to attract or retain senior management or other key personnel, our succession planning and operations could be materially and adversely affected.  We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate           management and other employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth. A loss of key employees or a significant shortage of high quality store employees could jeopardize our ability to meet our business           goals.. Our current insurance programs may expose us to unexpected costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our         financial condition and results of operations.. Our insurance coverage is structured to include deductibles, self-insured retentions, limits of liability, stop loss limits and similar         provisions that we believe prudent based on our operations. However, there are types of losses we may incur against which we cannot be insured or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to acts of terrorism         and some natural disasters, including floods.  If we incur such losses, our business could suffer.  In addition, we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers' compensation, general liability and group health insurance         programs. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses, including unexpected increases in medical and indemnity costs, could result in materially different amounts of expense         than expected under these programs.. 21. Table of Contents. Failure of our internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our business and financial results.. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control         over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is         not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud.  Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to         report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud.  The identification of a material weakness could indicate a lack of controls adequate to generate accurate financial statements that, in turn, could cause a loss of         investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to timely remediate any material weaknesses that may be identified in future periods or maintain all of the controls necessary for         continued compliance. Likewise, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies.. Our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders.. The Lion Fund II, L.P., an affiliate of Biglari Holdings Inc. (\"BH\"), is the beneficial owner of approximately 19.7% of our outstanding         common stock.  In the past, BH and its affiliates have nominated candidates for election to our board of directors at our annual meetings of shareholders, resulting in proxy contests, and called publicly for special meetings of shareholders to         consider other proposals.  While BH and its affiliates have not nominated director candidates for election at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the actions of BH and its affiliates or another activist shareholder in the future could         adversely affect our business because:.                                 responding to public proposals, special meeting requests and other actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming, and divert the                     attention of our management and employees;.                                 perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain                     qualified personnel and business partners; and.                                 pursuit of an activist shareholder's agenda may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our                     shareholders.. Provisions in our charter, Tennessee law and our shareholder rights plan may discourage potential acquirers of the         Company.. Our charter documents contain provisions that may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire or attempt to         acquire control of the Company.  In addition, we are subject to certain provisions of Tennessee law that limit, in some cases, our ability to engage in certain business combinations with significant shareholders.  In addition, we have adopted a         shareholder rights plan, which provides, among other things, that when specified events occur, our shareholders will be entitled to purchase from us shares of junior preferred stock.  The shareholder rights plan is currently scheduled to expire on         April 9, 2021, but would expire promptly following the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders if the shareholder rights plan is not approved by our shareholders. The preferred stock purchase rights are triggered ten days after the date of a public         announcement that a person or group acting in concert has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 20% or more of our outstanding common stock.  The preferred stock purchase rights would cause dilution to a person or         group that attempts to acquire the Company on terms that do not satisfy the requirements of a qualifying offer under the shareholder rights plan or are otherwise not approved by our Board of Directors.. These provisions, either alone or in combination with each other, give our current directors and executive officers a substantial         ability to influence the outcome of a proposed acquisition of the Company.  These provisions would apply even if an acquisition or other significant corporate transaction was considered beneficial by some of our shareholders.  If a change in         control or change in management is delayed or prevented by these provisions, the market price of our securities could decline.. 22. Table of Contents"
