[1] "Item 1A.  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk Factors.. Note Regarding Risk Factors. You should carefully consider the risk factors below as well as risks identified throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC in evaluating us. In addition to the following identified risks, there may also be risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial that may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, or if risks that we do not yet know or that we currently think are minor occur, our business, results of operation or financial condition could be adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline and stockholders might lose all or part of their investment. The risk factors presented below are those which we currently consider material. However, they are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks not presently known to us, or which we currently consider immaterial, may also adversely affect us. There may be risks that a particular investor views differently from us, and our analysis might be wrong. If any of the risks that we face actually occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected and could differ materially from any possible results suggested by any forward-looking statements that we have made or might make. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Except as required by law, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.. We have restated prior consolidated financial statements, which may lead to additional risks and uncertainties, including loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our stock price.. We have restated our consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (including the quarterly periods within those years), as well our consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, in order to correct certain accounting errors related to, among other items, our historical decision to consolidate the financial results of Pegasus.. As a result of those restatements and the circumstances giving rise to the restatements, we have become subject to a number of additional costs and risks, including accounting and legal fees incurred in connection with the restatement. In addition, the restatement may lead to a loss of investor confidence and have negative impacts on the trading price of our common stock.. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that, if not remediated, could result in additional material misstatements in our financial statements.. As described in “Part II, Item 9A — Controls and Procedures,” management has identified and evaluated the control deficiencies that gave rise to the accounting errors related to equity method accounting, foreign currency matters, related party transactions and accounting for significant and/or complex transactions, and has concluded that those deficiencies, represent material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of those material weaknesses, management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017. See “Part II, Item 9A — Controls and Procedures.”. We are in the process of developing and implementing a remediation plan to address the material weaknesses. If our remediation efforts are insufficient or if additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to further restate our financial results, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the material weaknesses, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments, harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.. Government regulations may limit our ability to recover and enforce the collection of our receivables.. Federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances may limit our ability to recover and enforce our rights with respect to the receivables acquired by us. These laws include, but are not limited to, the following federal statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder and comparable statutes in states and foreign jurisdictions such as Colombia and Peru where consumers reside and/or where creditors are located:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act;. 12. Table of Contents. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe Federal Trade Commission Act;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe Truth-In-Lending Act;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe Fair Credit Billing Act;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe Fair Credit Reporting Act;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe Financial Privacy Rule;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe Safeguards Rule;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tTelephone Consumer Protection Act;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”)/Health Information Technology for Economical and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”);. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tU.S. Bankruptcy Code; and. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCredit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009.. We may be precluded from collecting receivables we purchase where the creditor or other previous owner or third-party collection agency or attorney failed to comply with applicable law in originating or servicing such acquired receivables. Laws relating to the collection of consumer debt also directly apply to our business. Our failure to comply with any laws applicable to us, including state licensing laws, could limit our ability to recover on receivables and could subject us to fines and penalties, which could reduce our earnings and result in a default under our loan arrangements. In addition, our third-party collection agencies and attorneys may be subject to these and other laws and their failure to comply with such laws could also materially adversely affect our finance income and earnings.. Additional laws or amendments to existing laws may be enacted that could impose additional restrictions on the servicing and collection of receivables. Such new laws or amendments may adversely affect the ability to collect on our receivables, which could also adversely affect our finance income and earnings.. Because our receivables are generally originated and serviced pursuant to a variety of federal, state and/or local laws by a variety of entities and may involve consumers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and South America, there can be no assurance that all originating and servicing entities have, at all times, been in substantial compliance with applicable law. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we or our third-party collection agencies and attorneys have been or will continue to be at all times in substantial compliance with applicable law. Failure to comply with applicable law could materially adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables and could subject us to increased costs, fines and penalties.. We are subject to changing rules and regulations of federal and state government as well as the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed. These entities, including PCAOB, the SEC and the NASDAQ Global Market, have issued a significant number of new and increasingly complex requirements and regulations over the course of the last several years and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to laws enacted by Congress.. Changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact our operations.. Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act (also referred to as the Consumer Financial Protection Act) created a new independent regulator, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\"). The CFPB has rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement and other authorities relating to consumer financial products and services, including debt collection, provided by covered persons. We are subject to the CFPB's supervisory and enforcement authority.. The relationship between consumers, lenders and credit card issuers is extensively regulated by consumer protection and related laws and regulations. Changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment. This could affect our results of operations or increase our liabilities. These negative impacts could result from changes in collection laws, laws related to credit reporting, statutes of limitation, laws related to consumer bankruptcy or insolvency, privacy protection, accounting standards, taxation requirements, employment laws and communications laws, among others.. 13. Table of Contents. The CFPB also accepts debt collection consumer complaints and has provided form letters for consumers to use in their correspondences with debt collectors. The CFPB makes publicly available its data on consumer complaints, and consumer complaints against us could result in reputational damage to us. The Dodd-Frank Act also mandates the submission of multiple studies and reports to Congress by the CFPB, and CFPB staff is regularly making speeches on topics related to credit and debt. All of these activities could trigger additional legislative or regulatory action.. The CFPB has rulemaking authority with respect to significant federal statutes that impact the debt collection industry, including the Federal Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"), the Fair Credit Reporting Act \"FCRA\", and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC Act\"), which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices. As a result, the CFPB has the authority to adopt regulations that interpret the FDCPA, and the FTC Act, potentially describing specified acts and practices as being \"unfair,\" \"deceptive\" or \"abusive,\" impacting the manner in which we conduct our debt collection business.. The CFPB has the authority to conduct hearings and adjudication proceedings, impose monetary penalties for violations of applicable federal consumer financial laws (including Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, FDCPA, and FCRA, among other consumer protection statutes) which may require remediation of practices and include enforcement actions. The CFPB also has the authority to obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief), costs, and monetary penalties. In addition, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations implemented thereunder, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state Attorneys General and other state regulators to bring civil actions to remedy violations under state law. The CFPB has been active in its supervision, examination and enforcement of financial services companies, most notably bringing enforcement actions imposing fines and mandating large refunds to customers of several financial institutions for practices relating to the extension and collection of consumer credit. If the CFPB, the FTC, acting under the FTC Act or other applicable statute such as the FDCPA, or one or more state Attorneys General or other state regulators make findings that we have violated any of the applicable laws or regulations, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.. We may become subject to additional costs or liabilities in the future resulting from our own, or our vendors' supervision or examination by the CFPB, or by changes in, or additions to laws and regulations that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Further, we cannot definitively predict the scope and substance of any such laws or regulations ultimately adopted by the CFPB related to our activities and the exact efforts required by us to comply therewith, nor can we have any way to know with certainty the ultimate impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition that such regulations may have.. Investigations or enforcement actions by governmental authorities may result in changes to our business practices; negatively impact our receivables portfolio purchasing volume; make collection of receivables more difficult or expose us to the risk of fines, penalties, restitution payments and litigation.. Our business practices are subject to review from time to time by various governmental authorities and regulators, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\"), who may commence investigations or enforcement actions or reviews targeted at businesses in the financial services industry. These reviews may involve governmental authority consideration of individual consumer complaints, or could involve a broader review of our debt collection policies and practices. Such investigations could lead to assertions by governmental authorities that we are not complying with applicable laws or regulations. In such circumstances, authorities may request or seek to impose a range of remedies that could involve potential compensatory or punitive damage claims, fines, restitution payments, sanctions or injunctive relief, that if agreed to or granted, could require us to make payments or incur other expenditures that could have an adverse effect on our financial position. Government authorities could also request or seek to require us to cease certain of our practices or institute new practices.. We may also elect to change practices that we believe are compliant with applicable law and regulations in order to respond to the concerns of governmental authorities. In addition, we may become required to make changes to our internal policies and procedures in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act or other applicable laws. Such changes in practices or procedures could negatively impact our results of operations. Negative publicity relating to investigations or proceedings brought by governmental authorities could have an adverse impact on our reputation, could harm our ability to conduct business with industry participants, and could result in financial institutions reducing or eliminating sales of receivables portfolios to us which would harm our business and negatively impact our financial results. Moreover, changing or modifying our internal policies or procedures, responding to governmental inquiries and investigations and defending lawsuits or other proceedings could require significant efforts on the part of management and result in increased costs to our business. In addition, such efforts could divert management's full attention from our business operations. All of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.. 14. Table of Contents. We are exposed to interest rate volatility risk as interest rates can fluctuate in the period between when we purchase structured settlements payment streams and when we securitize such payment streams.. We purchase structured settlements at a discount rate based on, among other factors, our then estimates of the future interest rate environment. Once a critical mass of payment streams is achieved, those payment streams are then securitized, generally through fixed rate private placements. The discount rate at which our securitization is sold to investors is based on the current interest rates as of the time of the securitization. Interest rates may fluctuate significantly during the period between the purchase and securitization of payment streams, which can increase or decrease the spread between the discount rate at which we purchase the payment streams and the discount rate at which we securitize such payment streams, which could increase or decrease our revenues. Volatile interest rate environments can lead to volatility in our results of operations.. We may not be able to purchase consumer receivable portfolios domestically and internationally at favorable prices or on sufficiently favorable terms if at all.. Our success in the consumer receivables business segment depends upon the continued availability of consumer receivable portfolios that meet our purchasing criteria and our ability to identify and finance the purchases of such portfolios. The availability of consumer receivable portfolios at favorable prices and on terms acceptable to us, if at all, depends on a number of factors outside of our control, including:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe growth in consumer debt;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe volume of consumer receivable portfolios available for sale;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tavailability of financing to fund purchases;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompetitive factors affecting potential purchasers and sellers of consumer receivable portfolios;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpossible future changes in the bankruptcy laws, state laws and homestead acts which could make it more difficult for us to collect, and. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe foreign exchange rate changes of the countries in which we do business. There is no assurance that we will realize the full value of the deferred tax asset.. As of September 30, 2017, we had a net deferred tax asset of $12.7 million. Our ability to use our deferred tax asset is dependent on our ability to generate future earnings within the operating loss carry-forward periods, which are generally 20 years. Some or all of our deferred tax asset could expire unused if we are unable to generate taxable income in the future sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset, or we enter into transactions that limit our right to use it. If a material portion of our deferred tax asset expires unused, it could have a material adverse effect on our future business, results of operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock. Our ability to realize the deferred tax asset is periodically reviewed and any necessary valuation allowance is adjusted accordingly.. Additionally, on December 22, 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was signed into law. Among other provisions, the Act reduces the Federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. This rate reduction is expected to have a significant impact on our provisions for income taxes for periods beginning after September 30, 2017, including a one-time impact resulting from the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the new lower rate. Based on our initial assessment of the Act, we expect that it will result in a charge to income taxes of approximately $3.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.. We may not be able to collect sufficient amounts on our consumer receivable portfolios to recover the costs associated with the purchase of those portfolios and to fund our operations.. We acquire and collect on consumer receivable portfolios that contain charged-off receivables. In order to operate profitably over the long term, we must continually purchase and collect on a sufficient volume of receivables to generate revenue that exceeds our purchase costs. For accounts that are charged-off or semi-performing, the originators or interim owners of the receivables generally have:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmade numerous attempts to collect on these obligations, often using both their in-house collection staff and third-party collection agencies; and. 15. Table of Contents. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsubsequently deemed these obligations as uncollectible.. These receivable portfolios are purchased at significant discounts to the amount the consumers owe. These receivables are difficult to collect and actual recoveries may be less than the amount expected. In addition, our collections may worsen in a weak economic cycle. We may not recover amounts in excess of our acquisition and servicing costs.. Our ability to recover the purchase costs on our portfolios and produce sufficient returns can be negatively impacted by the quality of the purchased receivables. In the normal course of our portfolio acquisitions, some receivables may be included in the portfolios that fail to conform to certain terms of the purchase agreements and we may seek to return these receivables to the seller for payment or replacement receivables. However, we cannot guarantee that any of such sellers will be able to meet their payment obligations to us. Accounts that we are unable to return to sellers may yield no return. If cash flows from operations are less than anticipated as a result of our inability to collect sufficient amounts on our receivables, our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, purchase new portfolios, and achieve future growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected.. We may be subject to competition for the purchase of international consumer receivable portfolios which may result in an increase in prices of such portfolios.. We compete with other purchasers of consumer receivable portfolios, with third-party collection agencies and with financial services companies that manage their own consumer receivable portfolios. We compete on the basis of price, reputation, industry experience and performance. Some of our competitors have greater capital, personnel and other resources than we have. The possible entry of new competitors, including competitors that historically have focused on the acquisition of different asset types, and the expected increase in competition from current market participants may reduce our access to consumer receivable portfolios. Aggressive pricing by our competitors has raised the price of consumer receivable portfolios above levels that we are willing to pay, which could reduce the number of consumer receivable portfolios suitable for us to purchase or if purchased by us, reduce the profits, if any, generated by such portfolios. If we are unable to purchase receivable portfolios at favorable prices or at all, our finance income and earnings could be materially reduced.. We depend upon third parties to service a significant portion of our domestic and international consumer receivable portfolios. The loss of certain servicers could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operation.. As of September 30, 2017, 35% of our portfolio face value, which represents approximately 90% of our portfolio face value at all third party collection agencies and attorneys, was serviced by five organizations domestically. We are dependent upon the efforts of these collection agencies and attorneys to service and collect our consumer receivables. Any failure by our third-party collection agencies and attorneys to adequately perform collection services for us or remit such collections to us could materially reduce our finance income and our profitability. In addition, our finance income and profitability could be materially adversely affected if we are not able to secure replacement third party collection agencies and attorneys and redirect payments from the customers to our new third party collection agencies and attorneys promptly in the event our agreements with our third-party collection agencies and attorneys are terminated, our third-party collection agencies and attorneys fail to adequately perform their obligations or if our relationships with such third-party collection agencies and attorneys adversely change.. We may rely on third parties to locate, identify and evaluate consumer receivable portfolios available for purchase.. We may rely on third parties, including brokers and third-party collection agencies and attorneys, to identify consumer receivable portfolios and, in some instances, to assist us in our evaluation and purchase of these portfolios. As a result, if such third parties fail to identify receivable portfolios or if our relationships with such third parties are not maintained, our ability to identify and purchase additional receivable portfolios could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we, or such parties, fail to correctly or adequately evaluate the value or collectability of these consumer receivable portfolios, we may pay too much for such portfolios and suffer an impairment, which would negatively impact our earnings.. We rely on our third party collectors to comply with all rules and regulations and maintain proper internal controls over their accounting and operations.. Because the receivables were originated and serviced pursuant to a variety of federal and/or state laws by a variety of entities and involved consumers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Columbia and Peru, there can be no assurance that all original servicing entities have, at all times, been in substantial compliance with applicable law. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we or our third-party collection agencies and attorneys have been or will continue to be at all times in substantial compliance with applicable law. The failure to comply with applicable law and not maintain proper controls in accounting and operations could materially adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables and could subject us to increased costs, fines and penalties.. 16. Table of Contents. Our collections may decrease if bankruptcy filings increase.. During times of economic uncertainty, the amount of defaulted consumer receivables generally increases, which contributes to an increase in the amount of personal bankruptcy filings. Under certain bankruptcy filings, a debtor’s assets are sold to repay credit originators, but since the defaulted consumer receivables we purchase are generally unsecured, we may not be able to collect on those receivables. Our collections may decline with an increase in bankruptcy filings. If our actual collection experience with respect to a defaulted consumer receivable portfolio is significantly lower than we projected when we purchased the portfolio, our earnings could be negatively affected.. We are subject to various risks in connection with our litigation funding business.. Risks of the litigation funding business include the potential regulation or limitation of interest rates and other fees advanced by our litigation funding subsidiaries under federal and/or state regulation, a change in statutory or case law which limits or restricts the ability of our litigation funding subsidiaries to charge or collect fees and interest at anticipated levels, claimants being unsuccessful in whole or in part in the personal injury claims or divorce settlement upon which our funds are provided, the continued services of the senior management of our litigation funding subsidiaries to source and analyze cases in accordance with the subsidiaries’ respective underwriting guidelines.. The loss of any of our executive officers may adversely affect our operations and our ability to successfully acquire receivable portfolios.. Our executive officers are responsible for making substantially all management decisions, including determining which portfolios to purchase, the purchase price and other material terms of such portfolio acquisitions. These decisions are instrumental to the success of our business. Significant losses of the services of our executive officers or the inability to replace our officers with individuals who have experience in the industry or with the Company could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our ability to successfully acquire receivable portfolios.. The Stern family effectively controls the Company, substantially reducing the influence of our other stockholders.. Members of the Stern family own directly or indirectly, approximately 59% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of September 30, 2017. Through January 2019, the Stern family, in conjunction with a voting agreement signed with an activist shareholder in January 2017; is limited to voting up to 49% of the outstanding shares. As a result, the Stern family is able to significantly influence the actions that require stockholder approval, including:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe election of our directors; and. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe approval of mergers, sales of assets or other corporate transactions or matters submitted for stockholder approval.. As a result, our other stockholders may have reduced influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval. In addition, the Stern family’s influence could discourage any unsolicited acquisition of the Company and, consequently, materially adversely affect the price of our common stock.. Negative press regarding the debt collection industry may have a negative impact on a customer’s willingness to pay the debt we acquire.. Consumers are exposed to information from a number of sources that may cause them to be more reluctant to pay their debts or to pursue legal actions against us. Online, print and other media publish stories about the debt collection industry which cite specific examples of abusive collection practices. These stories can lead to the rapid dissemination of the story, adding to the level of exposure to negative publicity about our industry. Various internet sites are maintained where consumers can list their concerns about the activities of debt collectors and seek guidance from other website posters on how to handle the situation. Advertisements by debt relief attorneys and credit counseling centers are becoming more common, adding to the negative attention given to our industry. As a result of this negative publicity, customers may be more reluctant to pay their debts or could pursue legal action against us regardless of whether those actions are warranted. These actions could impact our ability to collect on the receivables we acquire and affect our revenues and profitability.. Class action suits and other litigation could divert our management’s attention from operating our business and increase our expenses.. Originators, debt purchasers and third-party collection agencies and attorneys in the consumer credit industry are frequently subject to putative class action lawsuits and other litigation. Claims include failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations and improper or deceptive origination and servicing practices. Being a defendant in such class action lawsuits or other litigation could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. As of September 30, 2017, we had set up a reserve for settlement costs of $2.3 million to cover a class action lawsuit.. 17. Table of Contents. Economic slowdowns increase our credit losses.. During periods of economic slowdown or recession, we experience an increase in rates of delinquencies and frequency and severity of credit losses. Our actual rates of delinquencies and frequency and severity of credit losses may be comparatively higher during periods of economic slowdown or recession than those experienced by more traditional providers of consumer credit because of our focus on the financially underserved consumer market, which may be disproportionately impacted.. Because a significant portion of our reported income is based on management’s estimates of the future performance of our asset portfolios and fees receivable, differences between actual and expected performance of the receivables may cause fluctuations in net income.. Significant portions of our reported income (or losses) are based on management’s estimates of cash flows we expect to receive on our asset portfolios and fees receivable, particularly for such assets that we report based on fair value. The expected cash flows are based on management’s estimates of interest rates, default rates, payment rates, cardholder purchases, servicing costs, and discount rates. These estimates are based on a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control. Substantial differences between actual and expected performance of the receivables will occur and cause fluctuations in our net income. For instance, higher than expected rates of delinquencies and losses could cause our net income to be lower than expected. Similarly, levels of loss and delinquency can result in our being required to repay our lenders earlier than expected, thereby reducing funds available to us for future growth.. We may determine to incur near-term losses based on longer-term strategic considerations.. We may consider long-term strategic considerations more important than near-term economic gains when assessing business arrangements and opportunities. For example, we expect the structure and pricing terms in near-term future securitization transactions, if any, to be substantially different from our past transactions, including lower revenues and lower advance rates. We may nevertheless determine to participate in, or structure, future financing transactions based on longer-term strategic considerations. As a result, net cash flows over the life of a future securitization trust, particularly any trust that we may facilitate in the near-term as we re-enter the securitization market, could be negative as a result of transaction size, transaction expenses or financing costs.. We may experience losses on portfolios consisting of new types of receivables or receivables in new geographies due to our lack of collection experience with these receivables, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.. We continually look for opportunities to expand the classes of assets that make up the portfolios we acquire. Therefore, we may acquire portfolios consisting of assets with which we have little or no collection experience or portfolios of receivables in new geographies where we do not historically maintain an operational footprint. Our lack of experience with these assets may hinder our ability to generate expected levels of profits from these portfolios. Further, our existing methods of collections may prove ineffective for these new receivables, and we may not be able to collect on these portfolios. Our inexperience with these receivables may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, including the expansion of our foreign operations.. Continued growth will place additional demands on our resources, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to manage our growth effectively. For example, continued growth could place strains on our management, operations, and financial resources that our infrastructure, facilities, and personnel may not be able to adequately support. In addition, the recent expansion of our foreign operations subjects us to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including:. ¦ \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompliance with and changes in international laws, including regulatory and compliance requirements that could affect our business;. ¦ \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased exposure to U.S. laws that apply abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;. ¦ \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsocial, political and economic instability or recessions;. ¦ \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in foreign economies and currency exchange rates;. 18. Table of Contents. ¦ \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulty in hiring, staffing and managing qualified and proficient local employees and advisors to run international operations;. ¦ \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe difficulty of managing and operating an international enterprise, including difficulties in maintaining effective communications with employees due to distance, language, and cultural barriers;. ¦ \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties implementing and maintaining effective internal controls and risk management and compliance initiatives;. ¦ \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential disagreements with our joint venture business partners;. ¦ \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiffering labor regulations and business practices; and. ¦ \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforeign tax consequences.. To support our growth and improve our international operations, we continue to make investments in infrastructure, facilities, and personnel in our operations; however, these additional investments may not be successful or our investments may not produce profitable results. If we cannot manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.. We may seek to make acquisitions that prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources.. We may seek to grow through acquisitions of related businesses in the financial services sector. Such acquisitions present risks that could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance, including:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe diversion of our management’s attention from our everyday business activities;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired business;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe contingent and latent risks associated with the past operations of, and other unanticipated problems arising in, the acquired business; and. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe need to expand management, administration and operational systems.. If we make such acquisitions, we cannot predict whether:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe will be able to successfully integrate the operations of any new businesses into our business;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe will realize any anticipated benefits of completed acquisitions; or. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthere will be substantial unanticipated costs associated with acquisitions.. In addition, future acquisitions by us may result in:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe incurrence of additional debt; and. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe recognition of significant charges for depreciation and impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets.. 19. Table of Contents. If our technology infrastructure is not operational, our operations could be disrupted and our ability to successfully operate the business could be compromised.. Our success depends, in part, on sophisticated telecommunications and computer systems. The temporary loss of our computer or telecommunications systems, through casualty, operating malfunction or service provider failure, could disrupt our operations. In addition, we must record and process significant amounts of data quickly and accurately to properly bid on prospective acquisitions of receivable portfolios and to access, maintain and expand the databases we use for our collection and monitoring activities. Any failure of our information systems and their backup systems could interrupt our operations. We may not have adequate backup arrangements for all of our operations and we may incur significant losses if an outage occurs. In addition, we rely on third-party collection agencies and attorneys who also may be adversely affected in the event of an outage in which the third-party collection agencies and attorneys do not have adequate backup arrangements. Any interruption in our operations or our third-party collection agencies’ and attorneys’ operations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We have implemented a disaster recovery program to mitigate this risk.. A cyber security incident could have a negative effect on our business as we outsource a significant amount of the collection accounts with personal information electronically.. A security breach could have a detrimental effect on our business as we maintain a significant amount of personal information in our electronic files. A breach of our system or a leak of the personal information we maintain could leave us vulnerable to, among other things, loss of information and potential litigation each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.. Our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it harder for us to be acquired without the consent and cooperation of our board of directors and management.. Several provisions of our organizational documents and Delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt, including a takeover attempt in which the potential purchaser offers to pay a per share price greater than the current market price of our common stock. Under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof. The ability to issue shares of preferred stock could tend to discourage takeover or acquisition proposals not supported by our current board of directors. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which restricts business combinations with some stockholders once the stockholder acquires 15% or more of our common stock.. Future sales of our common stock by our affiliates or other stockholders may depress our stock price.. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock. We had 6,685,415 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of October 11, 2018. Of these shares, 3,998,727 are owned by affiliates of the company, which are defined as in Rule 405 under the Act as a “person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with”, an issuer. In addition, options to purchase 555,100 shares of our common stock were outstanding as of September 30, 2017, of which 555,100 were exercisable. We may also issue additional shares in connection with our business and may grant additional stock options or restricted shares to our employees, officers, directors and consultants under our present or future equity compensation plans or we may issue warrants to third parties outside of such plans. As of September 30, 2017, there were 1,293,343 shares available for such purpose with such shares available under the 2012 Stock Option and Performance Award Plan. If a significant portion of these shares were sold in the public market, the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected.. We have the ability to issue preferred shares, warrants, convertible debt and other securities without stockholder approval which could dilute the relative ownership interest of current stockholders and adversely affect our share price.. Future sales of our equity-related securities in the public market, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings. Our common shares may be subordinate to classes of preferred shares issued in the future in the payment of dividends and other distributions made with respect to common shares, including distributions upon liquidation or dissolution. Our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to issue preferred shares without first obtaining stockholder approval. If we issued preferred shares, these additional securities may have dividend or liquidation preferences senior to our common shares. If we issue convertible preferred shares, a subsequent conversion may dilute the current common stockholders’ interest. We have similar abilities to issue convertible debt, warrants and other equity securities.. Climate change and related regulatory responses may adversely impact our business.. Climate change as a result of emissions of greenhouse gases is a significant topic of discussion and may generate federal and other regulatory responses in the near future, including the imposition of a so-called “cap and trade” system. It is impracticable to predict with any certainty the impact on our business of climate change or the regulatory responses to it, although we recognize that they could be significant. The most direct impact is likely to be an increase in energy costs, which would increase slightly our operating costs, primarily through increased utility and transportations costs. In addition, increased energy costs could impact consumers and their ability to incur and repay indebtedness. However, it is too soon for us to predict with any certainty the ultimate impact, either directionally or quantitatively, of climate change and related regulatory responses.. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and cause our stock price to decline.. Because of the nature of our business, our quarterly operating results may fluctuate, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our results may fluctuate as a result of any of the following:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing and amount of collections on our consumer receivable portfolios;. 20. Table of Contents. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour inability to identify and acquire additional consumer receivable portfolios;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta decline in the estimated future value of our consumer receivable portfolio recoveries;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreases in operating expenses associated with the growth of our operations;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral and economic market conditions; and within various jurisdictions; and. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprices we are willing to pay for consumer receivable portfolios.. Our financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies.. Our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non- U.S. dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide. The Company does not use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.. Our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities.. Responding to activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan. In addition, a proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting would require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and our board of directors. The perceived uncertainties as to our future direction also could affect the market price and volatility of our securities.. We are a “smaller reporting company” and, as such, are allowed to provide less disclosure than larger public companies.. We are currently a “smaller reporting company,” as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. As a “smaller reporting company,” we have certain decreased disclosure obligations in our SEC filings, which may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects and may result in less investor confidence.. Continued delays in the filing of our periodic reports with the SEC could result in the delisting of our common stock, which would materially and adversely affect our stock price, financial condition and/or results of operations.. As a result of the restatement of certain of our previously issued financial statements, we were unable to file this report with the SEC on a timely basis. We also have yet to file our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended December 31, 2017, March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, which were due in February, May and August of 2018, respectively. As a result, we remain non-compliant with NASDAQ listing rules requiring the timely filing of periodic reports, which may result in the delisting of our common stock should we fail to file such reports by November 30, 2018 (the deadline set forth in the extension granted to us by the Nasdaq hearings panel). In addition, the fact that we were not able to file the financial statements contained in this report on a timely basis has also caused us to delay our annual meeting of stockholders, which could serve as an additional basis for delisting our common stock. Delisting would likely have a significant material adverse effect on us by, among other things, reducing:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe liquidity of our common stock;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe market price of our common stock;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe number of institutional and other investors that will consider investing in our common stock;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe number of market makers in our common stock;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of our common stock;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common stock;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur ability to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur ability to use our equity as consideration in any merger transaction; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe effectiveness of equity-based compensation plans for our employees used to attract and retain individuals important to our operations."
