[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. Investing in our securities involves a number of significant risks. In addition to the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, you should consider carefully the following information before making an investment in our securities. The risks set out below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not presently deemed material by us might also impair our operations and performance. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In such case, our net asset value and the trading price of our common stock could decline or the value of our preferred stock, subscription rights, warrants, or debt securities may decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.. Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure. We are dependent upon our investment adviser's key personnel for our future success.. Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by our investment adviser, subject to oversight and supervision by our board of directors. As a result, we depend on the diligence, skill and network of business contacts of the principals of our investment adviser. These individuals have critical industry experience and relationships that we rely on to implement our business plan. If our investment adviser, which has a small number of investment professionals, loses the services of these individuals and cannot replace them, we may not be able to operate our business as we expect, and our ability to compete could be harmed, which could cause our operating results to suffer. In addition, changes in personnel at our investment adviser, including the recent resignation of one of the principals of our investment adviser, Ryan Magee, and the addition of Jim Fowler as our Chief Investment Officer, could impact our investment adviser's ability to compete effectively during and after the transition. In addition, we can offer no assurance that HCAP Advisors will remain our investment adviser.. The investment professionals of our investment adviser may in the future become affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us, and may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time. We expect that these investment professionals will continue to dedicate a significant portion of their time to our investment activities; however, they may in the future engage in other business activities which could divert their time and attention from our investment activities. For example, Joseph A. Jolson, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of our board of directors, is also the Chief Executive Officer and chairman of the board of directors of JMP Group, which owns, directly or indirectly, a majority interest in HCAP Advisors (the Company's investment adviser) and JMP Credit Advisors (the Company's current and historical administrator).. Our business model depends to a significant extent upon strong referral relationships of the principals of our investment adviser, and their inability to maintain or develop these relationships, as well as the failure of these relationships to generate investment opportunities, could adversely affect our business.. We expect that the principals of our investment adviser will maintain their relationships with financial institutions, private equity and other non-bank investors, investment bankers, commercial bankers, attorneys, accountants and consultants, and we rely to a significant extent upon these relationships to provide us with potential investment opportunities. If the principals of our investment adviser fail to maintain their existing relationships or develop new relationships with other sponsors or sources of investment opportunities, we will not be able to grow our investment portfolio. In addition, individuals with whom the principals of our investment adviser have relationships are not obligated to provide us with investment opportunities, and, therefore, there is no assurance that such relationships will generate investment opportunities for us.. Our financial condition and results of operations depend on our ability to manage our business and our future growth effectively.. Our ability to achieve our investment objective depends on our ability to manage and grow our business. This depends, in turn, on our investment adviser's ability to identify, invest in, and monitor companies that meet our investment criteria.. Accomplishing this result on a cost-effective basis will be largely a function of our investment adviser's structuring and execution of the investment process, its ability to provide competent, attentive and efficient services to us, and our access to financing on acceptable terms. The principals of our investment adviser will have substantial responsibilities under the investment advisory and management agreement. Such demands on their time may distract them or slow our rate of investment. In order to grow, our investment adviser will need to hire, train, supervise and manage new employees. However, we can offer no assurance that any such employees will contribute effectively to the work of our investment adviser. Any failure to manage our future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. 26. We provide debt and equity capital primarily to small and mid-sized companies, which may present a greater risk of loss than providing debt and equity capital to larger companies.. Our portfolio consists primarily of debt and equity investments in small and mid-sized companies. Compared to larger companies, small and mid-sized companies generally have more limited access to capital and higher funding costs, may be in a weaker financial position and may need more capital to expand, compete and operate their business. They also typically have fewer administrative resources, which can lead to greater  uncertainty in their ability to generate accurate and reliable financial data, including their ability to deliver audited financial statements. In addition, many small and mid-sized companies may be unable to obtain financing from the public capital markets or other traditional sources, such as commercial banks, in part because loans made to these types of companies entail higher risks than loans made to companies that have larger businesses, greater financial resources or are otherwise able to access traditional credit sources on more attractive terms.. A variety of factors may affect the ability of borrowers to make scheduled payments on loans, including failure to satisfy financial targets and covenants, a downturn in a borrower's industry or changes in the economy in general. In addition, investing in small and mid-sized companies in general involves a number of significant risks, including that small and mid-sized companies:. •  may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their debt securities that we hold, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of us realizing any guarantees we may have obtained in connection with our investment;. • typically have shorter operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares than larger businesses, which tend to render small and mid-sized companies more vulnerable to competitors' actions and market conditions, as well as general economic downturns;. • are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons; therefore, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on our portfolio company and, in turn, on us;. • generally have less predictable operating results, may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence, and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position;. • may from time to time be parties to litigation, and our executive officers, directors and our investment adviser may, in the ordinary course of business, be named as defendants in litigation arising from our investments in the portfolio companies;. • may have difficulty accessing the capital markets to meet future capital needs, which may limit their ability to grow or to repay their outstanding indebtedness upon maturity; and. • may be particularly vulnerable to changes in customer preferences and market conditions, depend on a limited number of customers, and face intense competition, including from companies with greater financial, technical, managerial and marketing resources.. Any of these factors or changes thereto could impair a small or mid-sized company's financial condition, results of operation, cash flow or result in other adverse events, such as bankruptcy, any of which could limit a borrower's ability to make scheduled payments on our loans. This, in turn, could result in losses in our loan portfolio and a decrease in our net interest income and net asset value.. There may be uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments.. Substantially all of our portfolio investments are in the form of securities that are not publicly traded. The fair value of securities and other investments that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable. We value these securities at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or \"GAAP.\" Our board of directors utilizes the services of an independent valuation firm to aid it in determining the fair value of these securities. The factors that may be considered in fair value pricing our investments include the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded companies, discounted cash flow, enterprise value and other relevant factors. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time, and may be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed. Our net asset value could be adversely affected if our determinations. 27. regarding the fair value of our investments were materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon the disposal of such securities.. We may experience fluctuations in our operating results.. We could experience fluctuations in our operating results due to a number of factors, including the interest rate payable on the debt securities we acquire, the default rate on such securities, the level of our expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets and general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods.. There are significant potential conflicts of interest which could impact our investment returns.. The investment professionals of our investment adviser may serve as officers, directors, principals, portfolio managers or advisers of or to entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do or of investment funds, accounts or vehicles managed by our investment adviser or its affiliates. Accordingly, they have or may in the future have obligations to investors in those funds, accounts or vehicles, the fulfillment of which obligations might not be in the best interests of us or our stockholders. We also note that any investment fund, account or vehicle managed by our investment adviser or its affiliates in the future may have overlapping investment objectives with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. We intend to co-invest with investment funds, accounts and vehicles managed by our investment adviser where doing so is consistent with our investment strategy as well as applicable law and SEC staff interpretations. Without an exemptive order from the SEC (as described below), we generally will only be permitted to co-invest with such investment funds, accounts and vehicles when the only term that is negotiated is price. When we invest alongside other investment funds, accounts and vehicles managed by our investment adviser, we expect our investment adviser to make such investments on our behalf in a fair and equitable manner consistent with our investment objective and strategies so that we are not disadvantaged in relation to any other future client of our investment adviser. In situations where co-investment alongside other investment funds, accounts and vehicles managed by our investment adviser is not permitted or appropriate, such as when there is an opportunity to invest in different securities of the same issuer, our investment adviser will need to decide whether we or such other entity or entities will proceed with the investment. Our investment adviser will make these determinations based on its policies and procedures, which generally require that such opportunities be offered to eligible accounts on a basis that will be fair and equitable over time. Although our investment adviser will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner in such event, it is possible that we may not be given the opportunity to participate in certain investments made by such other funds that are consistent with our investment objective.. In addition, on December 10, 2015, we received exemptive relief from the SEC permitting us greater flexibility to negotiate the terms of co-investments with investment funds managed by HCAP Advisors or JMP Credit Advisors and with certain accounts managed or held by JMP Group and certain of its subsidiaries, in each case in a manner consistent with our investment objectives and strategies as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors (including the terms and conditions of the exemptive order issued by the SEC). Under the terms of the relief, a \"required majority\" (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including (1) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objectives and strategies. We intend to co-invest, subject to the conditions included in the exemptive order we received from the SEC, with investment funds managed by HCAP Advisors or JMP Credit Advisors and with certain accounts managed or held by JMP Group and certain of its subsidiaries. We believe that such co-investments may afford us additional investment opportunities.. Our incentive fee may induce our investment adviser to pursue speculative investments.. The incentive fee payable by us to our investment adviser may create an incentive for our investment adviser to pursue investments on our behalf that are risky or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such compensation arrangement. Our investment adviser will receive the incentive fee based, in part, upon net capital gains realized on our investments. Unlike that portion of the incentive fee based on income, there is no hurdle rate applicable to the portion of the incentive fee based on net capital gains. As a result, the investment adviser may have a tendency to invest more capital in investments that are likely to result in capital gains as compared to income producing securities. Such a practice could result in our investing in more speculative securities than would otherwise be the case, which could result in higher investment losses, particularly during economic downturns.. The incentive fee payable by us to our investment adviser also may induce it to invest on our behalf in instruments that have a deferred interest feature, such as payment-in-kind, or PIK, interest. Under these investments, we would accrue the interest over the life of the investment but would not receive the cash income from the investment until the end of the investment's term, if. 28. at all. Our net investment income used to calculate the income portion of our incentive fee, however, includes accrued interest. Thus, a portion of the incentive fee would be based on income that we have not yet received in cash and may never receive in cash if the portfolio company is unable to satisfy such interest payment obligation to us. While we may make incentive fee payments on income accruals that we may not collect in the future and with respect to which we do not have a formal \"claw back\" right against our investment adviser per se, the amount of accrued income written off in any period will reduce the income in the period in which such write-off was taken and thereby reduce or have the effect of eliminating such period's incentive fee payment. However, in light of the 2% quarterly hurdle rate relating to the income incentive fee payable to our investment adviser, the reduction in such period's income incentive fee may not correlate perfectly with the benefit, if any, previously received by the investment adviser with respect to the income incentive fee at the time of the accrual of such income.. Finally, the fact that the incentive fee payable to our investment adviser is calculated based on a percentage of our return on invested capital may encourage our investment adviser to use leverage to increase the return on our investments. Under certain circumstances, the use of leverage may increase the likelihood of default, which could impair the value of our securities, particularly our common stock.. Our base management fee may induce our investment adviser to incur leverage.. The fact that our base management fee is payable based upon our gross assets, which would include any borrowings for investment purposes, may encourage our investment adviser to use leverage to make additional investments. Under certain circumstances, the use of increased leverage may increase the likelihood of default, which could impair the value of our securities, particularly our common stock. Given the subjective nature of the investment decisions made by our investment adviser on our behalf, we may not be able to monitor this potential conflict of interest.. PIK interest earned increases our assets under management and, as a result, will increase the amount of base management fees payable by us to HCAP Advisors.. Certain of our debt investments may contain provisions providing for the payment of PIK interest. Because PIK interest results in an increase in the size of the loan balance of the underlying loan, the receipt by us of PIK interest will have the effect of increasing our assets under management. As a result, because the base management fee that we pay to HCAP Advisors is based on the value of our gross assets, the receipt by us of PIK interest will result in an increase in the amount of the base management fee payable by us.. Changes in laws or regulations governing our operations may adversely affect our business.. We and our portfolio companies are subject to laws and regulations at the local, state and federal levels. These laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation, may be changed from time to time. Accordingly, any change in these laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.. We cannot predict how tax reform legislation will affect us, our investments, or our stockholders, and any such legislation could adversely affect our business.. Legislative or other actions relating to taxes could have a negative effect on us. The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department. The U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate passed tax reform legislation, which the President recently signed into law. Such legislation will make many changes to the Code, including significant changes to the taxation of business entities, the deductibility of interest expense, and the tax treatment of capital investment. We cannot predict with certainty how any changes in the tax laws might affect us, our stockholders, or our portfolio investments. New legislation and any U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions interpreting such legislation could significantly and negatively affect our ability to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC or the U.S. federal income tax consequences to us and our stockholders of such qualification, or could have other adverse consequences. Stockholders are urged to consult with their tax advisor regarding tax legislative, regulatory, or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our securities.. We are an \"emerging growth company\" and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our shares of common stock less attractive to investors.. We are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the \"JOBS Act\", and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \"emerging growth companies\" including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We cannot predict if investors will find shares of our. 29. common stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our shares of common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our shares and our share price may be more volatile.. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \"emerging growth company\" can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \"emerging growth company\" can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate us since our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates and may result in less investor confidence. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (a) the last day of the fiscal year (i) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering (December 31, 2018), (ii) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.1 billion, or (iii) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (b) the date on which we have issued more than $1.1 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.. Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm (when undertaken, as noted below), may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.. We are required to disclose changes made in our internal control on financial reporting on a quarterly basis and our management is required to assess the effectiveness of these controls annually.As of December 31, 2018, we will lose our status as an \"emerging growth company\" under the JOBS Act, and our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as of December 31, 2018.  An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls could detect problems that our management's assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation.. We seek to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of those internal controls in particular when reporting challenges arise. For example, we were unable to timely file this annual report on Form 10-K because additional time, resources, and effort were required to complete procedures and other work relating to certain of the Company's portfolio company investments. Those additional procedures were required because material financial information from one of these portfolio companies was not promptly supplied to our financial staff by certain senior investment professionals, including the Company's then-Chief Executive Officer and a senior investment professional responsible for this portfolio company. The senior investment professional with responsibility for the portfolio company resigned. As a result of that matter, the Company had to further evaluate these and other portfolio company investments to ensure all financial data reported in the consolidated financial statements was complete and accurate before filing this annual report on Form 10-K. While the Company has taken remedial measures in response to this matter, as described further in Item 9A of this annual report on Form 10-K, we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations in the future if a similar matter were to occur and it were not identified by our internal controls.. Regulations governing our operations will affect our ability to raise, and the method for raising, additional capital, which may expose us to risks.. Our business requires a substantial amount of capital. However, we may not be able to raise additional capital in the future on favorable terms or at all. We may issue debt securities, other evidences of indebtedness or preferred stock, and we may borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, which we collectively refer to as \"senior securities,\" up to the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act. Currently, we are generally permitted to issue senior securities in amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities; however, as discussed under \"Recent legislation may allow us to incur additional leverage\" below, we may be permitted to increase our leverage if we receive certain. 30. approvals from our independent directors and/or our stockholders. As a result of issuing senior securities, we will also be exposed to typical risks associated with leverage, including an increased risk of loss. If we issue preferred stock, it will rank \"senior\" to common stock in our capital structure, and will have priority over our common stock as to the distribution of assets and payments of dividends. Preferred stockholders will also have separate voting rights and may have rights, preferences or privileges more favorable than those of holders of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the holders of our common stock.. To the extent that we are constrained in our ability to issue debt or other senior securities, we will depend on issuances of common stock to finance our operations. As a BDC, we generally are not able to issue our common stock at a price below net asset value without first obtaining required approvals of our stockholders and independent directors. This requirement may limit our ability to issue additional stock to finance our operations, since our common stock may trade, and has traded at times, at a discount to our net asset value.  In addition, if we raise additional funds by issuing more common stock or senior securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common stock, the percentage ownership of our stockholders at that time would decrease, which may subject them to dilution. If we cannot raise additional capital, we may be significantly constrained in our ability to make new investments and grow our business.. Recent legislation may allow us to incur additional leverage.. The 1940 Act generally prohibits us from incurring indebtedness unless immediately after such borrowing we have an asset coverage for total borrowings of at least 200% (i.e., the amount of debt may not exceed 50% of the value of our assets). However, recent legislation has modified the 1940 Act by allowing a BDC to increase the maximum amount of leverage it may incur from an asset coverage ratio of 200% to an asset coverage ratio of 150%, if certain requirements are met. Under the legislation, we are allowed to increase our leverage capacity if shareholders representing at least a majority of the votes cast, when quorum is met, approve a proposal to do so. If we receive shareholder approval, we would be allowed to increase our leverage capacity on the first day after such approval.  Alternatively, the legislation allows the majority of our independent directors to approve an increase in our leverage capacity, and such approval would become effective after one year. In either case, we would be required to make certain disclosures on our website and in SEC filings regarding, among other things, the receipt of approval to increase our leverage, our leverage capacity and usage, and risks related to leverage.. As a result of this legislation, we may be able to increase our leverage up to an amount that reduces our asset coverage ratio from 200% to 150%. Leverage magnifies the potential for loss on investments in our indebtedness and on invested equity capital. As we use leverage to partially finance our investments, you will experience increased risks of investing in our securities. If the value of our assets increases, then leveraging would cause the net asset value attributable to our common stock to increase more sharply than it would have had we not leveraged. Conversely, if the value of our assets decreases, leveraging would cause net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged our business. Similarly, any increase in our income in excess of interest payable on the borrowed funds would cause our net investment income to increase more than it would without the leverage, while any decrease in our income would cause net investment income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not borrowed. Such a decline could negatively affect our ability to pay common stock dividends, scheduled debt payments or other payments related to our securities. Leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique. See \"Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Structure - Because we borrow money, the potential for loss on amounts invested in us is magnified and may increase the risk of investing in us.\". Because we borrow money in connection with our investment activities, the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested in us is magnified and may increase the risk of investing in us.. Borrowings, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for gain or loss on invested equity capital. As we use leverage to partially finance our investments, you will experience increased risks associated with investing in our common stock. If the value of our assets increases, then leveraging would cause the net asset value attributable to our common stock to increase more sharply than it would have had we not utilized leverage. Conversely, if the value of our assets decreases, leveraging would cause net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had we not utilized leverage. Similarly, any increase in our income in excess of interest payable on the borrowed funds would cause our net investment income to increase more than it would without the leverage, while any decrease in our income would cause our net investment income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not borrowed. Such a decline could negatively affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.. At December 31, 2017, we had $45.5 million of outstanding indebtedness with an annualized cost of $2.8 million related to interest and unused line fees. In order for us to cover these annualized interest payments on indebtedness, we must achieve annual returns on our investments of at least 2.44%.. 31. Advances under our $55.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility with Pacific Western Bank (successor to CapitalSource Bank), as agent and a lender, and each of the lenders from time to time party thereto, including City National Bank (the \"Credit Facility\"), bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of (i) LIBOR plus 3.25% and (ii) the maximum rate permitted under applicable law. In addition, the Credit Facility requires payment of a fee for unused amounts during the revolving period, which fee varies depending on the obligations outstanding as follows: (i) 0.75% per annum, if the average daily principal balance of the obligations outstanding for the prior month are less than fifty percent of the maximum loan amount; and (ii) 0.50% per annum, if such obligations outstanding are equal to or greater than fifty percent of the maximum loan amount. In each case, the fee is calculated based on the difference between (i) the maximum loan amount under the Credit Facility and (ii) the average daily principal balance of the obligations outstanding during the prior calendar month. The Credit Facility is secured by all of the Company's assets. If we are unable to meet the financial obligations under the Credit Facility, and an event of default occurs and is not cured, the lenders under the Credit Facility could exercise their remedies against the Company's assets and would have a superior claim to such assets over our stockholders.. The Company's $28.8 million of unsecured notes, or the \"2022 Notes\", have a fixed annual interest rate of 6.125% and require quarterly interest payments until the notes mature in September 2022.. Illustration. The following table illustrates the effect of leverage on returns from an investment in our common stock assuming various annual returns, net of expenses. The calculations in the table below are hypothetical and actual returns may be higher or lower than those appearing below.. Assumed Return on Our Portfolio. (net of expenses). -10%   -5%   0%   5%   10% Corresponding return to stockholder     (19 )%   (11 )%   (3 )%   4 %   12 %. Assumes (i) $115.6 million in portfolio investments at December 31, 2017, (ii) $45.5 million in outstanding indebtedness at  December 31, 2017, (iii) $81.8 million in net assets at December 31, 2017 and (iv) average cost of funds of 6.2%, which is the estimated weighted average borrowing cost under our Credit Facility and 2022 Notes at December 31, 2017.. All of our assets are subject to security interests under the Credit Facility, and if we default on our obligations under the Credit Facility, we may suffer materially adverse consequences, including foreclosure on our assets.. As of December 31, 2017, all of our assets were pledged as collateral under our Credit Facility. If we default on our obligations under the Credit Facility, the lenders have the right to foreclose upon and sell, or otherwise transfer, the collateral subject to their security interests. If the lenders exercise their right to sell the assets pledged under the Credit Facility, such sales may be completed at distressed sale prices, thereby diminishing or potentially eliminating the amount of cash available to us after repayment of the amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility. Such deleveraging of our company could significantly impair our ability to effectively operate our business and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, in such a circumstance, we could be forced to curtail or cease new investment activities and lower or eliminate the distributions that we have historically paid to our stockholders.. Changes in interest rates may affect our cost of capital and net investment income.. We leverage our investments with borrowed money and plan to continue doing so. As a result our net investment income depends, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest those funds. While we have a significant percentage of floating rate assets to match our floating rate liabilities, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income in the event we use debt to finance our investments.. Our business and operation could be negatively affected if we become subject to shareholder activism, which could cause us  to incur significant expense, hinder execution of investment strategy and impact our stock price.. Shareholder activism, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing in publicly traded companies and in the BDC space recently. Shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs and divert management's and our board of directors' attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, we may be required to incur significant legal fees and other. 32. expenses related to activist shareholder matters. Further, our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism.. Provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.. The Delaware General Corporation Law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or making difficult a change in control of our company or the removal of our incumbent directors. The existence of these provisions, among others, may have a negative impact on the price of our common stock and may discourage third-party bids for ownership of our company. These provisions may prevent any premiums being offered to holders of our common stock.. The investment advisory and management agreement with our investment adviser and the administration agreement with our administrator were not negotiated on an arm's length basis and may not be as favorable to us as if they had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.. The investment advisory and management agreement with our investment adviser and the administration agreement with our administrator were negotiated between related parties. Joseph A. Jolson, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of our board of directors, is also the Chief Executive Officer and chairman of the board of directors of JMP Group, which owns, directly or indirectly, a majority interest in HCAP Advisors (the Company's investment adviser) and JMP Credit Advisors (the Company's current and historical administrator). Consequently, the terms of these agreements, including fees payable to our investment adviser, may not be as favorable to us as if they had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party. In addition, we may choose not to enforce, or to enforce less vigorously, our rights and remedies under these agreements because of our desire to maintain our ongoing relationship with JMP Group and its respective affiliates.. Our board of directors may change our investment objective, operating policies and strategies without prior notice or stockholder approval.. Our board of directors has the authority to modify or waive certain of our operating policies and strategies without prior notice and without stockholder approval. However, absent stockholder approval, we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC. We cannot predict the effect any changes to our current operating policies and strategies would have on our business, operating results and value of our securities. Nevertheless, the changes may adversely affect our business and affect our ability to make distributions.. The involvement of our investment adviser's investment professionals in our valuation process may create conflicts of interest.. Our portfolio investments are generally not in publicly traded securities. As a result, the values of these securities are not readily available. We value these securities at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. In connection with that determination, and in addition to valuations prepared by the independent third party valuation firm that we employ, investment professionals from our investment adviser prepare portfolio company valuations based upon the most recent portfolio company financial statements available and projected financial results of each portfolio company. The participation of our investment adviser's investment professionals in our valuation process could result in a conflict of interest as our investment adviser's management fee is based on our gross assets.. Our investment adviser has the right to resign on 60 days' notice, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations.. Our investment adviser has the right, under the investment advisory and management agreement, to resign at any time upon not less than 60 days' written notice, whether we have found a replacement or not. If our investment adviser resigns, we may not be able to find a new investment adviser or hire internal management with similar expertise and ability to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms within 60 days, or at all. If we are unable to do so quickly, our operations are likely to experience a disruption, our financial condition, business and results of operations as well as our ability to pay distributions are likely to be adversely affected and the market price of our shares may decline. In addition, the coordination of our internal management and investment activities is likely to suffer if we are unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by our investment adviser and its affiliates. Even if we are able to retain comparable management, whether internal or external, the integration of such management and their lack of familiarity with our investment objective may result in additional costs and time delays that may adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations.. 33. If we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets, we could fail to qualify as a BDC or be precluded from investing according to our current business strategy.. We may not acquire any assets other than \"qualifying assets\" unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such acquisition, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets. See \"Business--Regulation as a BDC.\". We believe that most of the subordinated and senior debt investments that we intend to target should constitute qualifying assets. However, we may be precluded from investing in what we believe are attractive investments if such investments are not qualifying assets for purposes of the 1940 Act. Similarly, these rules could prevent us from making follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies (which could result in the dilution of our position).. A failure on our part to maintain our qualification as a BDC would significantly reduce our operating flexibility.. If we fail to continuously qualify as a BDC, we might be subject to regulation as a registered closed-end investment company under the 1940 Act, which would significantly decrease our operating flexibility. In addition, failure to comply with the requirements imposed on BDCs by the 1940 Act could cause the SEC to bring an enforcement action against us. For additional information on the qualification requirements of a BDC, see the disclosure under the caption \"Business--Regulation as a BDC.\". We may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income.. As a RIC, we will be required to distribute annually at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses to maintain our eligibility for RIC tax treatment. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will include in taxable income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as contracted payment-in-kind, or PIK, interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term. The increases in loan balances as a result of contracted payment-in-kind arrangements will be included in income in advance of receiving cash payment, and will be separately identified on our consolidated statements of cash flows. We also may be required to include in income certain other amounts that we will not receive in cash.. Any warrants that we receive in connection with our debt investments will generally be valued as part of the negotiation process with the particular portfolio company. As a result, a portion of the aggregate purchase price for the debt investments and warrants will be allocated to the warrants that we receive. This will generally result in our debt instruments having original issue discount, or \"OID,\" for tax purposes, which we must recognize as ordinary income as such original issue discount accrues regardless of whether we have received any corresponding payment of such interest. Other features of debt instruments that we hold may also cause such instruments to generate original issue discount.. Since in certain cases we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses to maintain our eligibility for regulated investment company tax treatment. Accordingly, we may have to sell some of our assets, raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce new investment originations to meet these distribution requirements. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources to satisfy such distribution requirements, we may fail to qualify for regulated investment company tax treatment and thus may become subject to corporate-level income tax.. We will be subject to corporate-level income tax and may default under our Credit Facility if we are unable to satisfy certain RIC qualification requirements under Subchapter M of the Code or do not satisfy the annual distribution requirement.. In order to satisfy the requirements for RIC tax treatment, we must meet the following annual distribution, income source and asset diversification requirements to be relieved of federal taxes on income and gains distributed to our stockholders.. • The Annual Distribution Requirement for a regulated investment company will be satisfied if we distribute to our stockholders on an annual basis at least 90% of our net ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any. Because we use debt financing, we will be subject to an asset coverage ratio requirement under the 1940 Act. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources, we could fail to qualify for regulated investment company tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level income tax.. 34. • The income source requirement will be satisfied if we obtain at least 90% of our income for each year from dividends, interest, gains from the sale of stock or securities or similar sources.. • The asset diversification requirement will be satisfied if we meet certain asset diversification requirements at the end of each quarter of our taxable year. To satisfy this requirement, at least 50% of the value of our assets must consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other regulated investment companies, and other acceptable securities; and no more than 25% of the value of our assets can be invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other regulated investment companies, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or of certain \"qualified publicly traded partnerships.\" Failure to meet these requirements may result in our having to dispose of certain investments quickly in order to prevent the loss of regulated investment company status. Because most of our investments will be in private companies, and therefore will be relatively illiquid, any such dispositions could be made at disadvantageous prices and could result in substantial losses.. If we fail to satisfy certain RIC qualification requirements under Subchapter M of the Code or to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement for any reason and are subject to corporate income tax, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions. Furthermore, if we fail to maintain our qualification as a RIC, we may be in default under the terms of the Credit Facility. Such a failure would have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders.. We will continue to need additional capital to finance our growth because we intend to distribute substantially all of our income to our stockholders to maintain our qualification as a RIC. If additional funds are unavailable or are not available on favorable terms, our ability to grow will be impaired.. In order to satisfy the requirements applicable to a RIC, we intend to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses. As a BDC, we are generally required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total senior securities, which include all of our borrowings and any preferred stock that we may issue in the future. Currently this coverage ratio is 200%. This requirement will limit the amount that we may borrow. Because we will continue to need capital to grow our loan and investment portfolio, this limitation may prevent us from incurring debt and require us to raise additional equity at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. While we expect to be able to borrow and to issue additional debt and equity securities, we cannot assure you that debt and equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, as a BDC, we generally are not permitted to issue common stock priced below net asset value without stockholder and independent director approval. However, if we were to obtain the necessary approvals to issue securities at prices below net asset value, our stockholders' investments would experience dilution as a result of such issuance. If additional funds are not available to us, we could be forced to curtail or cease our lending and investment activities, and our net asset value could decrease.. We are dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.               Our business is dependent on our and third parties' communications and information systems. Any failure or interruption of those systems, including as a result of the termination of an agreement with any third-party service providers, could cause delays or other problems in our activities. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control and adversely affect our business. There could be:. •  sudden electrical or telecommunications outages;. • natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes;. • disease pandemics;. • events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and. • cyber attacks.. These events, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.. 35. We may expose ourselves to risks if we engage in hedging transactions.. If we engage in hedging transactions, we may expose ourselves to risks associated with such transactions. We may utilize instruments such as forward contracts, currency options and interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates. Hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. However, such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions. Such hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions should increase. Moreover, it may not be possible to hedge against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated that we are not able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price.. The success of our hedging transactions will depend on our ability to correctly predict movements in currencies and interest rates. Therefore, while we may enter into such transactions to seek to reduce currency exchange rate and interest rate risks, unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged may vary. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. In addition, it may not be possible to hedge fully or perfectly against currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies because the value of those securities is likely to fluctuate as a result of factors not related to currency fluctuations.. Risks Relating to Economic Conditions. Economic recessions or downturns could impair our portfolio companies and harm our operating results.. Many of our portfolio companies are susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and may be unable to repay our loans during such periods. Therefore, our non-performing assets will likely increase and the value of our portfolio will likely decrease during these economic conditions. Adverse economic conditions also may decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans and the value of our equity investments. Further, economic slowdowns or recessions could lead to financial losses in our portfolio and a decrease in revenues, net income and assets. Unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. These events could prevent us from increasing investments and harm our operating results.. A portfolio company's failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, termination of its loans and foreclosure on its secured assets, which could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize such portfolio company's ability to meet its obligations under debt securities that we hold. We may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting portfolio company. In addition, if one of our portfolio companies were to go bankrupt, even if we had structured our interest as senior debt, depending on the facts and circumstances, including the extent to which we actually provided managerial assistance to that portfolio company, a bankruptcy court might re-characterize our debt holding and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors.. The capital markets may experience periods of disruption and instability. Such market conditions may materially and adversely affect debt and equity capital markets in the United States, which may have a negative impact on our business and operations.. From time to time, the U.S. capital markets may experience periods of disruption and instability. For example, between 2008 and 2009, the U.S. capital markets were unstable and experienced extreme volatility and disruption. Those disruptions in the capital markets increased the spread between the yields realized on risk-free and higher risk securities and resulted in illiquidity in parts of the capital markets, significant write-offs in the financial services sector, the re-pricing of credit risk in certain credit markets, and the failure of major financial institutions. Those capital markets conditions also resulted in recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending. While market conditions have experienced relative stability in recent years, there can be no assurance that adverse market conditions will not repeat themselves in the future or otherwise worsen. If existing market conditions worsen or the market conditions similar to those experienced from 2008 through 2009 were to be repeated for any substantial length of time, the U.S. capital markets could experience a prolonged period of market illiquidity, which could have a  material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets, or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. These events could limit our investment originations, limit our ability to grow, and negatively impact our operating results.. 36. In addition, significant changes or volatility in the capital markets may also have a negative effect on the valuations of our investments. While most of our investments are not publicly traded, applicable accounting standards require us to assume as part of our valuation process that our investments are sold in a principal market to market participants (even if we plan on holding an investment through its maturity). Significant changes in the capital markets may also affect the pace of our investment activity and the potential for liquidity events involving our investments. Thus, the illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments to access capital if required, and as a result, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded our investments if we were required to sell them for liquidity purposes. An inability to raise or access capital could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.. Changes to United States tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on our portfolio companies and, in turn, harm us.. There has been on-going discussion and commentary regarding potential significant changes to United States trade policies, treaties and tariffs. The current administration, along with Congress, has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and other countries with respect to the trade policies, treaties and tariffs. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between the impacted nations and the United States. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our portfolio companies' access to suppliers or customers and have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition and results of operations, which in turn would negatively impact us.. Risks Relating to Our Investments. We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.. We face competition from entities that also make the types of investments that we plan to make. We compete with public and private funds (including other BDCs), commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. Many of our potential competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than we do, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, as a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to continue to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objective.. We do not seek to compete primarily based on the interest rates we offer, and we believe that some of our competitors may make loans with interest rates that are comparable to or lower than the rates we offer. We may lose investment opportunities if we do not match our competitors' pricing, terms and structure. However, if we match our competitors' pricing, terms and structure, we may experience decreased net interest income and increased risk of credit loss.. Our investments may be risky, and we could lose all or part of our principal.. Our portfolio consists primarily of directly originated investments in subordinated and senior debt of small to mid-size companies. In addition, we may make non-control, equity co-investments in these companies in conjunction with our debt investments.. Subordinated debt investments. We generally structure our subordinated debt investments with a security interest that ranks junior to a company's secured debt in priority of payment, but senior to a company's preferred or common stock. As such, other creditors will rank senior to us in the event of insolvency, which may result in an above average amount of risk and loss of principal.. Senior debt investments. We also invest in senior debt of small and mid-sized companies. Senior debt investments are typically secured by the assets of the portfolio company, including a pledge of the capital stock of the portfolio company's subsidiaries, and are senior to all other junior capital in terms of payment priority. There is, however, a risk that the collateral securing these loans may decrease in value over time, may be difficult to sell in a timely manner, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based upon the success of the portfolio company and market conditions, including as a result of the inability of the portfolio company to raise additional capital, and, in some circumstances, our lien could be subordinated to claims of other. 37. creditors. In addition, deterioration in a portfolio company's financial condition and prospects, including its inability to raise additional capital, may be accompanied by deterioration in the value of the collateral for the loan. Consequently, the fact that a loan is secured does not guarantee that we will receive principal and interest payments according to the loan's terms, or at all, or that we will be able to collect on the loan should we be forced to enforce our remedies.. Equity investments. When we invest in subordinated debt or senior debt, we may acquire equity securities as well. In addition, we may invest directly in the equity securities of portfolio companies. Our goal is ultimately to dispose of such equity interests and realize gains upon our disposition of such interests. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience.. The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.. We generally make investments in private companies. Substantially all of these securities are subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or are otherwise less liquid than publicly traded securities. The illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need arises. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our investments. In addition, we may face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a portfolio company to the extent that we or our investment adviser have material non-public information regarding such portfolio company.. Our failure to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies could impair our investment in a portfolio company.. Following an initial investment in a portfolio company, we may make additional investments in that portfolio company as \"follow-on\" investments, in order to:. • increase or maintain in whole or in part our equity ownership percentage in a portfolio company;. • exercise warrants, options or convertible securities that were acquired in the original or subsequent financing; or. • attempt to preserve or enhance the value of our investment.. We may elect not to make follow-on investments or otherwise lack sufficient funds to make those investments. We will have the discretion to make any follow-on investments, subject to any applicable legal requirements, including the RIC diversification requirements, and the availability of capital resources. The failure to make follow-on investments may, in some circumstances, jeopardize the continued viability of a portfolio company and our initial investment, or may result in a missed opportunity for us to increase our participation in a successful operation. Even if we have sufficient capital to make a desired follow-on investment, we may elect not to make a follow-on investment because we may not want to increase our concentration or level of risk, either because we prefer other opportunities (or because we are inhibited by compliance with BDC requirements or the desire to maintain our RIC tax status).. Because we generally do not hold controlling equity interests in our portfolio companies, we may not be in a position to exercise control over our portfolio companies or to prevent decisions by the management of our portfolio companies that could decrease the value of our investments.. Although we may do so in the future, we generally do not take controlling equity positions in our portfolio companies. As a result, we will be subject to the risk that a portfolio company may make business decisions with which we disagree, and that the management and/or stockholders of a portfolio company may take risks or otherwise act in ways that are adverse to our interests. Due to the lack of liquidity of the debt and equity investments that we will typically hold in our portfolio companies, we may not be able to dispose of our investments in the event we disagree with the actions of a portfolio company and may therefore suffer a decrease in the value of our investments.. Defaults by our portfolio companies will harm our operating results.. A portfolio company's failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, termination of its loans and foreclosure on its assets. This could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize such portfolio company's ability to meet its obligations under the debt or equity securities that we hold. We may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms, which may include the waiver of certain financial covenants, with a defaulting portfolio company.. 38. Prepayments of our debt investments by our portfolio companies could adversely impact our results of operations and ability to make stockholder distributions and result in a decline in the market price of our shares.. We are subject to the risk that the debt investments we make in our portfolio companies may be repaid prior to maturity. We expect that our investments will generally allow for repayment at any time subject to certain penalties. When this occurs, we intend to generally reinvest these proceeds in temporary investments, pending their future investment in accordance with our investment strategy. These temporary investments will typically have substantially lower yields than the debt being prepaid, and we could experience significant delays in reinvesting these amounts. Any future investment may also be at lower yields than the debt that was repaid. As a result, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if one or more of our portfolio companies elects to prepay amounts owed to us. Additionally, prepayments could negatively impact our ability to make, or the amount of, stockholder distributions with respect to our common stock, which could result in a decline in the market price of our shares.. An investment strategy focused primarily on privately held companies presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies, a dependence on the talents and efforts of only a few key portfolio company personnel and a greater vulnerability to economic downturns.. We invest primarily in privately held companies. Generally, little public information exists about these companies, and we will be required to rely on the ability of our investment adviser's investment professionals to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential returns from investing in these companies. If we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, we may not make a fully informed investment decision, and we may lose money on our investments. Also, privately held companies frequently have less diverse product lines and smaller market presence than larger competitors. These factors could adversely affect our investment returns as compared to companies investing primarily in the securities of public companies.. Our portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies.. We invest primarily in subordinated debt, senior debt, and, to a lesser extent, equity securities issued by our portfolio companies. Some of our portfolio companies have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the debt securities in which we invest. By their terms, such debt instruments may provide that the holders are entitled to receive payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution in respect of our investment. After repaying such senior creditors, such portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of debt ranking equally with debt securities in which we invest, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant portfolio company.. There may be circumstances where our debt investments could be subordinated to claims of other creditors or we could be subject to lender liability claims.. Even though we may have structured certain of our investments as senior debt, if one of our portfolio companies were to go bankrupt, depending on the facts and circumstances and based upon principles of equitable subordination as defined by existing case law, a bankruptcy court could subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors and transfer any lien securing such subordinated claim to the bankruptcy estate. The principles of equitable subordination defined by case law have generally indicated that a claim may be subordinated only if its holder is guilty of misconduct or where the senior loan is re-characterized as an equity investment and the senior lender has actually provided significant managerial assistance to the bankrupt debtor. We may also be subject to lender liability claims for actions taken by us with respect to a borrower's business or instances where we exercise control over the borrower. It is possible that we could become subject to a lender's liability claim, including as a result of actions taken in rendering significant managerial assistance or actions to compel and collect payments from the borrower outside the ordinary course of business.. Second priority liens on collateral securing loans that we make to our portfolio companies may be subject to control by senior creditors with first priority liens. If there is a default, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to repay in full both the first priority creditors and us.. 39. Certain loans that we make to portfolio companies will be secured on a second priority basis by the same collateral securing senior secured debt of such companies. The first priority liens on the collateral will secure the portfolio company's obligations under any outstanding senior debt and may secure certain other future debt that may be permitted to be incurred by the company under the agreements governing the loans. The holders of obligations secured by the first priority liens on the collateral will generally control the liquidation of and be entitled to receive proceeds from any realization of the collateral to repay their obligations in full before us. In addition, the value of the collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. There can be no assurance that the proceeds, if any, from the sale or sales of all of the collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the loan obligations secured by the second priority liens after payment in full of all obligations secured by the first priority liens on the collateral. If such proceeds are not sufficient to repay amounts outstanding under the loan obligations secured by the second priority liens, then we, to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the collateral, will only have an unsecured claim against the company's remaining assets, if any.. The rights we may have with respect to the collateral securing the loans we make to our portfolio companies with senior debt outstanding may also be limited pursuant to the terms of one or more intercreditor agreements that we enter into with the holders of senior debt. Under such an intercreditor agreement, at any time that obligations that have the benefit of the first priority liens are outstanding, any of the following actions that may be taken in respect of the collateral will be at the direction of the holders of the obligations secured by the first priority liens: the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the collateral; the ability to control the conduct of such proceedings; the approval of amendments to collateral documents; releases of liens on the collateral; and waivers of past defaults under collateral documents. We may not have the ability to control or direct such actions, even if our rights are adversely affected.. Our portfolio is concentrated in a limited number of portfolio companies and industries, which will subject us to a risk of significant loss if any of these companies defaults on its obligations under any of its debt instruments or if there is a downturn in a particular industry.. Our portfolio is concentrated in a limited number of portfolio companies and industries. Although we will be subject to the asset diversification requirements associated with our qualification as a RIC under the Code and have adopted a guideline that we will generally refrain from investing more than 15% of our portfolio in any single industry sector, our portfolio may be subject to concentration risk due to our investment in a limited number of portfolio companies. As a result, the aggregate returns we realize may be significantly adversely affected if a small number of investments perform poorly or if we need to write down the value of any one investment. Additionally, a downturn in any particular industry in which we are invested could also significantly impact the aggregate returns we realize. As of December 31, 2017, we had one loan on non-accrual status. This loan comprised approximately 7.2% of our debt portfolio at cost, which may be a higher percentage of the portfolio at cost than the BDC industry average. The continued failure by borrowers under these loans to pay interest and repay principal, and the failure by other borrowers to make such payments, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation and, consequently, our ability to meet our payment obligations under the 2022 Notes.. Risks Relating to Our Securities and an Offering of Our Securities. We may be unable to invest a significant portion of the net proceeds from an offering of our securities on acceptable terms within an attractive timeframe.. Delays in investing the net proceeds raised in an offering of our securities may cause our performance to be worse than that of other fully invested BDCs or other lenders or investors pursuing comparable investment strategies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify any investments that meet our investment objective or that any investment that we make will produce a positive return. We may be unable to invest the net proceeds of any offering on acceptable terms within the time period that we anticipate or at all, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.. We anticipate that, depending on market conditions, it may take us a substantial period of time to invest substantially all of the net proceeds of any offering in securities meeting our investment objective. During this period, we will invest the net proceeds of an offering primarily in cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government and agency securities, repurchase agreements relating to such securities, and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which may produce returns that are significantly lower than the returns which we expect to achieve when our portfolio is fully invested in securities meeting our investment objective. As a result, any distributions that we pay during this period may be substantially lower than the distributions that we may be able to pay when our portfolio is fully invested in securities meeting our investment objective. In addition, until such time as the net proceeds of an offering are invested in securities meeting our investment objective, the market. 40. price for our common stock may decline. Thus, the return on an investment in us may be lower than when, if ever, our portfolio is fully invested in securities meeting our investment objective.. We may allocate the net proceeds from an offering in ways with which you may not agree.. We will have significant flexibility in investing the net proceeds of an offering and may use the net proceeds from an offering in ways with which you may not agree or for purposes other than those contemplated at the time of the offering. In addition, we can provide you with no assurance that by increasing the size of our available equity capital our expense ratio or debt ratio will be lowered.. Shares of closed-end investment companies, including BDCs, may trade at a discount to their net asset value.. Shares of closed-end investment companies, including BDCs, may trade at a discount to net asset value. This characteristic of closed-end investment companies and BDCs is separate and distinct from the risk that our net asset value per share may decline. We cannot predict whether our common stock will trade at, above or below net asset value. In addition, if our common stock trades below net asset value, we will generally not be able to issue additional common stock at the market price unless our stockholders approve such a sale and our independent directors make certain determinations.. If our investments do not meet our performance expectations, our stockholders may not receive distributions or a portion of our distributions may be a return of capital.. We make and expect to continue to make distributions on a monthly basis to our stockholders. We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to continue to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. Also, restrictions and provisions in our Credit Facility and any future credit facilities may limit our ability to make distributions in certain circumstances. If we do not distribute annually at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term losses, we will be subject to corporate-level federal income tax, which may reduce the amounts available for distribution. We cannot assure you that you will receive distributions at a particular level or at all.. When we make distributions, we will be required to determine the extent to which such distributions are paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of an investor's basis in our stock and, assuming that an investor holds our stock as a capital asset, thereafter as a capital gain.. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.. The market price and liquidity of the market for our securities may be significantly affected by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. These factors include:. •  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of BDCs or other companies in our sector, which is not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies;. • changes in regulatory policies or tax guidelines, particularly with respect to RICs or BDCs;. • failure to qualify or loss of our qualification, as applicable, as a RIC or BDC;. • changes in earnings or variations in operating results;. • changes in the value of our portfolio of investments;. • changes in accounting guidelines governing valuation of our investments;. • any shortfall in revenue or net income or any increase in losses from levels expected by investors or securities analysts;. • departures of key personnel;. • loss of a major funding source;. • operating performance of companies comparable to us;. • litigation and governmental investigations; and. 41. • economic and political conditions or events.. Such fluctuations in the market price and demand for our common stock may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock.. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the availability of such common stock for sale, could adversely affect the prevailing market prices for our common stock. If this occurs and continues, it could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of securities should we desire to do so.. Stockholders may experience dilution in their ownership percentage if they do not participate in our dividend reinvestment plan.. All distributions declared in cash payable to stockholders that are participants in our dividend reinvestment plan are generally automatically reinvested in shares of our common stock. As a result, stockholders that do not participate in the dividend reinvestment plan may experience dilution over time. Stockholders who receive distributions in shares of common stock may experience accretion to the net asset value of their shares if our shares are trading at a premium and dilution if our shares are trading at a discount. The level of accretion or discount would depend on various factors, including the proportion of our stockholders who participate in the plan, the level of premium or discount at which our shares are trading and the amount of the distribution payable to a stockholder.. Investing in our securities may involve an above average degree of risk.. The investments we make in accordance with our investment objective may result in a higher amount of risk, and higher volatility or loss of principal, than alternative investment options. Our investments in portfolio companies may be speculative and, therefore, an investment in our securities may not be suitable for someone with lower risk tolerance.. If we issue preferred stock and/or debt securities, the net asset value and market value of our common stock may become more volatile or otherwise adversely affected.. We cannot assure you that the issuance of preferred stock and/or debt securities would result in a higher yield or return to the holders of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock and/or debt securities would likely cause the net asset value and market value of our common stock to become more volatile. If the distribution rate on the preferred stock, or the interest rate on the debt securities, were to approach the net rate of return on our investment portfolio, the benefit of leverage to the holders of our common stock would be reduced. If the distribution rate on the preferred stock, or the interest rate on the debt securities, were to exceed the net rate of return on our portfolio, the use of leverage would result in a lower rate of return to the holders of common stock than if we had not issued the preferred stock and/or debt securities. Any decline in the net asset value of our investment would be borne entirely by the holders of our common stock. Therefore, if the market value of our portfolio were to decline, the leverage would result in a greater decrease in net asset value to the holders of our common stock than if we were not leveraged through the issuance of preferred stock and/or debt securities. This decline in net asset value would also tend to cause a greater decline in the market price for our common stock.. The issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock could also adversely affect the market price for our common stock by making an investment in our common stock less attractive. In addition, except in limited circumstances, the 1940 Act imposes certain features onto any preferred stock we issue that may make an investment in our common stock less attractive or otherwise limit  our operational flexibility, including:. • preferred stock constitutes a \"senior security\" for purposes of the asset coverage test;. • dividends on any preferred stock we issue generally must be cumulative;. • payments of dividends on and repayments of the liquidation preference of preferred stock must take preference over any dividends or other payments to our common stockholders;. 42. • the holders of shares of preferred stock, if any are issued, must be entitled as a class to elect two directors at all times and to elect a majority of the directors if and for so long as dividends on the preferred stock are in arrears by two years or more; and. • under the terms of such securities, we may not be permitted to declare a cash distribution on our common stock or purchase our common stock unless our preferred stock (together with all of our other senior securities) has at the time of the declaration of any such distribution or at the time of any such purchase an asset coverage ratio of at least 200% or, if we obtain the required approvals from our independent directors and/or stockholders, 150% (after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase price, as the case may be).. There is also a risk that, in the event of a sharp decline in the value of our net assets, we would be in danger of failing to maintain required asset coverage ratios which may be required by the preferred stock and/or debt securities or of a downgrade in the ratings of the preferred stock and/or debt securities or our current investment income might not be sufficient to meet the distribution requirements on the preferred stock or the interest payments on the debt securities.. In order to counteract such an event, we might need to liquidate investments in order to fund redemption of some or all of the preferred stock and/or debt securities. In addition, we would pay (and the holders of our common stock would bear) all costs and expenses relating to the issuance and ongoing maintenance of the preferred stock and/or debt securities. Holders of preferred stock and/or debt securities may have different interests than holders of common stock and may at times have disproportionate influence over our affairs.. The trading market or market value of our debt securities or any convertible debt securities, if issued to the public, may be volatile.. Our debt securities or any convertible debt securities, if issued to the public, may or may not have an established trading market. We cannot assure investors that a trading market for our debt securities or any convertible debt securities, if issued to the public, would develop or be maintained if developed. In addition to our creditworthiness, many factors may materially adversely affect the trading market for, and market value of, our publicly issued debt securities or any convertible debt securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:. •  the time remaining to the maturity of these debt securities;. • the outstanding principal amount of debt securities with terms identical to these debt securities;. • the general economic environment;. • the supply of debt securities trading in the secondary market, if any;. • the redemption, repayment or convertible features, if any, of these debt securities;. • the level, direction and volatility of market interest rates generally; and. • market rates of interest higher or lower than rates borne by the debt securities.. There also may be a limited number of buyers for our debt securities. This too may materially adversely affect the market value of the debt securities or the trading market for the debt securities. Our debt securities may include convertible features that cause them to more closely bear risks associated with an investment in our common stock.. Terms relating to redemption may materially adversely affect the return on any debt securities.. If we issue any debt securities or any convertible debt securities that are redeemable at our option we may choose to redeem the debt securities at times when prevailing interest rates are lower than the interest rate paid on the debt securities. In addition, if the debt securities are subject to mandatory redemption, we may be required to redeem the debt securities at times when prevailing interest rates are lower than the interest rate paid on the debt securities. In this circumstance, a holder of our debt securities may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as the debt securities being redeemed.. The issuance of subscription rights, warrants or convertible debt that are exchangeable for our common stock, will cause your interest in us to be diluted as a result of any such rights, warrants or convertible debt offering.. 43. Stockholders who do not fully exercise rights, warrants or convertible debt issued to them in any offering of subscription rights, warrants or convertible debt to purchase our common stock should expect that they will, at the completion of the offering, own a smaller proportional interest in us than would otherwise be the case if they fully exercised their rights, warrants or convertible debt. We cannot state precisely the amount of any such dilution in share ownership because we do not know what proportion of the common stock would be purchased as a result of any such offering.. In addition, if the subscription price, warrant price or convertible debt price is less than our net asset value per share of common stock at the time of such offering, then our stockholders would experience an immediate dilution of the aggregate net asset value of their shares as a result of the offering. The amount of any such decrease in net asset value is not predictable because it is not known at this time what the subscription price, warrant price, convertible debt price or net asset value per share will be on the expiration date of such offering or what proportion of our common stock will be purchased as a result of any such offering. The risk of dilution is greater if there are multiple rights offerings. However, our board of directors will make a good faith determination that any offering of subscription rights, warrants or convertible debt would result in a net benefit to existing stockholders.. Future offerings of debt securities, which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation, or equity securities, which could dilute our existing stockholders and may be senior to our common stock for the purposes of distributions, may harm the value of our common stock.. In the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making offerings of debt or equity securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes and classes of preferred stock or common stock, subject to the restrictions of the 1940 Act. Upon a liquidation of our company, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings by us may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the value of our common stock, or both. Any preferred stock we may issue would have a preference on distributions that could limit our ability to make distributions to the holders of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their stock holdings in us. In addition, proceeds from a sale of common stock will likely be used to increase our total assets or to pay down our borrowings, among other uses. This would increase our asset coverage ratio and permit us to incur additional leverage under rules pertaining to BDCs by increasing our borrowings or issuing senior securities such as preferred stock or additional debt securities.. We have unsecured 2022 Notes that are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness we have incurred or may incur in the future.. Our 2022 Notes are not secured by any of our assets. As a result, the 2022 Notes are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness we, have outstanding or that they may incur in the future (or any indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which we subsequently grant security) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. In any liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy, or other similar proceeding, the holders of any of our existing or future secured indebtedness may assert rights against the assets pledged to secure that indebtedness in order to receive full payment of their indebtedness before the assets may be used to pay other creditors, including the holders of the 2022 Notes. As of December 31, 2017, we had $16.7 million in outstanding indebtedness under our Credit Facility.  This indebtedness is secured by all of our assets and therefore effectively senior to the 2022 Notes to the extent of the value of such assets.. The 2022 Notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our future subsidiaries.. The 2022 Notes are obligations exclusively of Harvest Capital Credit Corporation and not of any subsidiaries that we may have. None of our future subsidiaries, if any, will be a guarantor of the 2022 Notes, and the 2022 Notes are not required to be guaranteed by any subsidiaries we may have.. Except to the extent we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, all claims of creditors, including trade creditors, and holders of preferred stock, if any, of our subsidiaries, if any, will have priority over our claims (and therefore the claims of our creditors, including holders of the 2022 Notes) with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries. Even if we were recognized as a creditor of one or more of our existing or future subsidiaries, if any, our claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interests in the assets of any such existing or future subsidiary and to any indebtedness or other liabilities of any such subsidiary senior to our claims. Consequently, the 2022 Notes will be subordinated structurally to all indebtedness and other. 44. liabilities, including trade payables, of any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish as financing vehicles or otherwise. All of the existing indebtedness of our existing and future subsidiaries would be structurally senior to the 2022 Notes.. The indenture under which the 2022 Notes are issued contains limited protection for holders of the 2022 Notes.. The indenture under which the 2022 Notes are issued offers limited protection to holders of the 2022 Notes. The terms of the indenture and the 2022 Notes do not restrict our or any of our future subsidiaries' ability to engage in, or otherwise be a party to, a variety of corporate transactions, circumstances or events that could have an adverse impact on an investment in the 2022 Notes. In particular, the terms of the indenture and the 2022 Notes do not place any restrictions on our or our subsidiaries' ability to:. • issue securities or otherwise incur additional indebtedness or other obligations, including (1) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be equal in right of payment to the 2022 Notes, (2) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be secured and therefore rank effectively senior in right of payment to the 2022 Notes to the extent of the values of the assets securing such debt, (3) indebtedness of ours that is guaranteed by one or more of our subsidiaries and which therefore is structurally senior to the 2022 Notes, and (4) securities, indebtedness, or obligations issued or incurred by our subsidiaries that would be senior to our equity interests in our subsidiaries and therefore rank structurally senior to the 2022 Notes with respect to the assets of our subsidiaries, in each case other than an incurrence of indebtedness or other obligation that would cause a violation of Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions, whether or not we continue to be subject to such provisions of the 1940 Act, but giving effect, in each case, to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC. Currently, these provisions generally prohibit us from incurring additional borrowings, including through the issuance of additional debt securities, unless our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after such borrowings , but recently passed legislation may allow us to reduce our asset coverage ratio to 150% and increase our leverage if we obtain certain approvals as described under \"--Recent legislation may allow us to incur additional leverage.\";. • pay dividends on, or purchase or redeem or make any payments in respect of, capital stock or other securities ranking junior in right of payment to the 2022 Notes, except that we have agreed that, for the period of time during which the 2022 Notes are outstanding, we will not violate Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by (i) Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions and after giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC and (ii) the following two exceptions: (A) we will be permitted to declare a cash dividend or distribution notwithstanding the prohibition contained in Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, but only up to such amount as is necessary for us to maintain our status as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and (B) this restriction will not be triggered unless and until such time as our asset coverage has not been in compliance with the minimum asset coverage required by Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act (after giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC) for more than six consecutive months. If Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act were applicable to us, these provisions would generally prohibit us from declaring any cash dividend or distribution upon any class of our capital stock, or purchasing any such capital stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, were below 200% at the time of the declaration of the dividend or distribution or the purchase and after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase, but recently passed legislation may allow us to reduce our asset coverage ratio to 150% and increase our leverage if we obtain certain approvals as described under \"--Recent legislation may allow us to incur additional leverage.\";. • sell assets (other than certain limited restrictions on our ability to consolidate, merge, or sell all or substantially all of our assets);. • enter into transactions with affiliates;. • create liens (including liens on the shares of our future subsidiaries) or enter into sale and leaseback transactions;. • make investments; or. • create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from any of our future subsidiaries.. Additionally, the indenture governing the 2022 Notes does not require us to make an offer to purchase the 2022 Notes in connection with a change of control or any other event.. 45. Furthermore, the terms of the indenture and the 2022 Notes do not protect holders of the 2022 Notes in the event that we experience changes (including significant adverse changes) in our financial condition, results of operations or credit ratings, as they do not require that we or any of our future subsidiaries adhere to any financial tests or ratios or specified levels of net worth, revenues, income, cash flow or liquidity.. Our ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the 2022 Notes may have important consequences for holders of the 2022 Notes, including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the 2022 Notes or negatively affecting the trading value of the 2022 Notes.. Other debt we issue or incur in the future could contain more protections for its holders than the indenture and the 2022 Notes, including additional covenants and events of default. The issuance or incurrence of any such debt with incremental protections could affect the market for and trading levels and prices of the 2022 Notes.. An active trading market for the 2022 Notes may not exist, which could limit the market price of the 2022 Notes or a holder's ability to sell them.. The 2022 Notes are a new issue of debt securities listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol \"HCAPZ.\" Although the 2022 Notes are listed on NASDAQ, we cannot provide any assurances that an active trading market will exist in the future for the 2022 Notes or that holders will be able to sell their 2022 Notes. Even if an active trading market does exist, the 2022 Notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering price depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our credit ratings, general economic conditions, our financial condition, performance and prospects, and other factors. To the extent an active trading market does not exist, the liquidity and trading price for the 2022 Notes may be harmed.. We may choose to redeem the 2022 Notes when prevailing interest rates are relatively low.. We may choose to redeem the 2022 Notes from time to time, especially when prevailing interest rates are lower than the rate borne by the 2022 Notes. If prevailing rates are lower at the time of redemption, and we were to redeem the 2022 Notes, a holder of the 2022 Notes would not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the 2022 Notes being redeemed. Our redemption right also may adversely impact a holder's ability to sell the 2022 Notes as the optional redemption date or period approaches.. If we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the 2022 Notes.. Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under the Credit Facility or other indebtedness to which we may be a party, that is not waived by the required lenders, and the remedies sought by such lenders, could make us unable to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on the 2022 Notes and substantially decrease the market value of the 2022 Notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing our indebtedness (including the Credit Facility), we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under the Credit Facility or other debt we may incur in the future could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow in the future is, to some extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under the Credit Facility or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the 2022 Notes and our other debt and to fund other liquidity needs.. If our operating performance declines and we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may in the future need to refinance or restructure our debt, including any 2022 Notes sold, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, seek to raise additional capital or seek to obtain waivers from the required lenders under the Credit Facility or other debt that we may incur in the future to avoid being in default. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under the 2022 Notes and our other debt. If we breach our covenants under the Credit Facility or other debt and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under the Credit Facility or other debt, the lenders could exercise their rights as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If we are unable to repay debt, lenders having secured obligations could proceed. 46. against the collateral securing the debt. Because the Credit Facility has, and any future credit facilities will likely have, customary cross-default provisions, if the indebtedness under the 2022 Notes, the Credit Facility or under any future credit facility is accelerated, we may be unable to repay or finance the amounts due."
