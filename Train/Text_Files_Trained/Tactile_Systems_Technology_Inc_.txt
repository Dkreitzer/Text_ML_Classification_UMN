[1] "Item 1A.  Risk Factors.. Risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our business may also affect our actual results and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.. Risks Related to Our Business. Our revenues are primarily generated from our Flexitouch system and we are therefore highly dependent on only one product.. Our Flexitouch system accounted for 92% and 87% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We expect that sales of this product will continue to account for the substantial majority of our revenues going forward. Therefore, our ability to execute our growth strategy will depend not only upon increasing awareness of lymphedema, but also on the adoption of our Flexitouch system to treat this condition. Many physicians and clinicians may have experience with, and/or invested substantial resources in, developing expertise in traditional or alternative treatments for lymphedema, which may make them less willing to adopt our Flexitouch system. If our Flexitouch system fails to achieve wide market acceptance for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.. Our long-term growth depends on awareness and adoption of our products.. A primary growth strategy is to establish our products as the standard of care for the treatment of lymphedema and chronic venous insufficiency. In order to achieve this growth strategy, we must:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincrease clinician and consumer awareness of these diseases, which are often undertreated;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tintroduce the clinical and economic benefits of our solutions to physicians, therapists and other clinicians across several specialties and in various clinical settings; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdemonstrate consistent coverage and reimbursement for our solutions by private payers, Medicare, the Veterans Administration and certain Medicaid programs.. Clinicians may not adopt our solutions as the standard of care for lymphedema and chronic venous insufficiency or may not prescribe our products for a number of reasons, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour inability to educate a sufficient number of clinicians on these diseases or our products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe unavailability or inadequacy of insurance coverage or reimbursement for our products;. 26. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure of evidence supporting clinical benefits or cost-effectiveness of our products over existing alternatives to convince clinicians to change their treatment methods; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tresistance from clinicians to replace traditional treatments with our solutions.. We believe recommendations and support of our products by key opinion leaders can influence market acceptance and adoption. If these key opinion leaders choose to not support our products, our ability to achieve broad market acceptance for our products may be impaired.. If we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate levels of coverage or reimbursement for our products, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.. Any decline in the amount payers are willing to pay for our products could create pricing pressure for us. If we are forced to lower the price we charge for our products, our gross margins will decrease, which will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, insurance benefit levels vary substantially by health plan, meaning that some patients have high annual out-of-pocket medical costs, which may make it difficult for those patients to afford our products.. Third-party payers, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for our products exists among third-party payers. Therefore, reimbursement for our products can differ significantly from payer to payer and our products are not universally covered by third-party commercial payers. In addition, payers, including Medicare, continually review existing technologies for continued coverage and can, without notice, deny or reverse coverage for existing products. We believe a reduction or elimination of coverage or reimbursement of our products by Medicare would likely cause many commercial third-party payers to implement similar reductions in their coverage or reimbursement of our products. If we are unable to expand coverage of our products by additional commercial payers, or if third-party payers that currently cover or reimburse for our products reverse or limit their coverage in the future, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.. Further, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement may be subject to increased restrictions, such as additional preauthorization requirements, both in the United States and in international markets. If we are unable to satisfy any new preauthorization requirements or adjust to any future new restrictions on our products, third-party coverage and reimbursement may be limited in the future, which could have an adverse impact on our business.. The U.S. patent protection for our Flexitouch system expired in 2017, and thus may subject us to increased competition and reduce or eliminate our opportunity to generate product revenues.. The four U.S. patents for our Flexitouch system expired in 2017. Given the expiration of these patents, third parties may be permitted to incorporate aspects of our Flexitouch system into their products or create substantially similar or generic versions of our Flexitouch system. This could subject us to increased competition from products attempting to replicate our technology. Moreover, these competitors could sell their competing products for a substantially lower price, which could substantially limit our opportunity to increase or maintain revenues from our Flexitouch system and, in fact, our revenues could be substantially reduced, causing a material adverse effect on our business.. If we are unable to expand, manage and maintain our direct sales and marketing organizations, we may not be able to generate anticipated revenues.. Our operating results are directly dependent upon the sales and marketing efforts of our employees. If our direct sales force fails to adequately promote, market and sell our products, our sales may suffer. Our direct sales force has grown from three representatives in March 2005 to a team of over 160 people as of December 31, 2017.. In order to generate future sales growth, we will need to expand the size and geographic scope of our direct sales organization. Accordingly, our future success will depend largely on our ability to continue to hire, train, retain and motivate skilled sales personnel with significant technical knowledge of lymphedema and chronic venous insufficiency. Because the competition for their services is high, we cannot assure you we will be able to hire and retain additional personnel on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Failure to hire or retain qualified sales personnel would prevent us from building awareness of our solutions, expanding our business and generating additional sales. If. 27. Table of Contents. we are unable to expand our sales and marketing capabilities, we may not be able to effectively commercialize our products, which could have an adverse impact on our business.. Increases in our operating costs could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. Reimbursement rates are established by fee schedules mandated by private payers, Medicare, the Veterans Administration and certain Medicaid programs and are likely to remain constant or decrease due, in part, to federal and state government budgetary constraints. As a result, with respect to Medicare and Medicaid related revenues, we may not be able to offset the effects of general inflation on our operating costs through increases in prices for our products. In particular, labor and related costs account for a significant portion of our operating costs and we compete with other healthcare providers to attract and retain qualified or skilled personnel and with various industries for administrative and service employees. This competitive environment could result in increased labor costs. As such, we must control our operating costs, particularly labor and related costs, and failing to do so could adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations.. Our operating costs may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased sales and marketing costs to increase awareness of our products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcosts to develop new and enhanced features for current products and research and development costs for new products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe time, resources, and expense required to develop and conduct clinical trials and seek additional regulatory clearances and approvals for additional treatment indications for our products and for any additional products we develop;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending, and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany product liability or other lawsuits related to our products and the costs associated with defending them or the costs related to the results of such lawsuits;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe costs to attract and retain personnel with the skills required for effective operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe costs associated with being a public company; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcosts associated with entering international markets.. Our failure to anticipate and minimize the impact of these costs could adversely affect our business and results of operations.. We compete and may compete in the future against other companies, some of which have longer operating histories, more established products or greater resources than we do, which may harm our business.. The medical device industry is highly competitive. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain a competitive position in the development of technologies and solutions for the at-home treatment of lymphedema and chronic venous insufficiency or for market adjacencies. Any product we develop will have to compete for market acceptance and market share. We face significant competition in the United States, and we expect the intensity of competition will increase over time. Our primary competitors are Bio Compression Systems, Inc. and Lympha Press USA. Other competitors include Wright Therapy Products (which was acquired by BSN Medical GmbH in 2015), Devon Medical Products and NormaTec Industries. If we expand internationally, we expect that Arjo AB would become a competitor, in addition to other potential international competitors. Many of the companies developing or marketing competing products enjoy several competitive advantages, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsignificantly greater name recognition;. 28. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablished relations with healthcare professionals, customers, and third-party payers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablished distribution networks;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadditional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer higher discounts or other incentives to gain a competitive advantage;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgreater history in conducting research and development, manufacturing, marketing, and obtaining regulatory approval for homecare devices; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgreater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing, patent litigation and customer financing.. Our competitors may develop and patent processes or products earlier than us, obtain regulatory clearance or approvals for competing devices more rapidly than us or develop more effective or less expensive products or technologies that render our technology or products obsolete or less competitive. We also face fierce competition in recruiting and retaining qualified sales, scientific, reimbursement and management personnel, particularly those with direct-to-patient and -provider experience. If our competitors are more successful than us in these matters, our business may be harmed.. Physicians and payers may require additional clinical studies prior to prescribing our products or to providing or maintaining coverage and reimbursement for our products. Any subsequent clinical studies that are conducted and published may not be positive or consistent with our existing data, which would adversely affect the rate of adoption of our products.. Our success depends in large part on the medical and third-party payer community's acceptance of our products as being useful in treating patients with lymphedema or chronic venous insufficiency. While the results of our studies collectively indicate a favorable safety and efficacy profile, the study designs and results may not be viewed as compelling to physicians and insurers. In particular, payers and physicians may see limitations in the design and results of the studies because certain studies were not specifically based on our products, involved a limited number of total subjects or subjects outside the control group and made \"quality of life\" conclusions based upon criteria contained in patient questionnaires that required subjective conclusions. Certain physicians and insurers may also prefer to see longer-term efficacy data than we have produced or are able to produce. If physicians or insurers do not find our data compelling or wish to wait for additional or independently-performed studies, they may choose not to prescribe or to provide coverage and reimbursement for our products.. We cannot assure you that any data that we or others generate will be consistent with that observed in the existing studies or that results will be maintained beyond the time points studied. We also cannot assure you that any data that may be collected will be compelling to the medical community because the data may not be scientifically meaningful or may not demonstrate that our products are attractive alternatives to traditional treatments. If subsequent studies are not positive or consistent with our existing data, adoption of our products may suffer and, accordingly, our business could be adversely impacted.. Our long-term growth depends on our ability to develop and commercialize additional products.. The medical device industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change and technological advancements. Therefore, it is important to our business that we continue to enhance our product offerings and introduce new products. Developing products is expensive and time-consuming and could divert management's attention away from our business. We may not be successful in developing new products or enhancements to existing products. Our ability to develop and commercialize additional products or enhancements to existing products will depend on several factors, including our ability to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproperly identify and anticipate physician and patient needs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely manner;. 29. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tavoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third-parties;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdemonstrate the safety and efficacy of new products with data from clinical studies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for new products or product enhancements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbe fully FDA-compliant with the development, manufacturing and marketing of new devices or modified products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovide adequate training to potential users of our products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsecure adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelop an effective and dedicated sales and marketing team.. If we are unsuccessful in developing and commercializing new products, our ability to increase our revenues may be impaired.. It is difficult to forecast future performance and our financial results may vary from forecasts and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.. Our limited operating history and commercial experience make it difficult for us to predict future performance. A number of factors over which we have limited control, such as seasonal variations in revenues, may contribute to fluctuations in our financial results. In the first quarter, our results of operations have been negatively impacted by resetting of annual patient healthcare insurance plan deductibles, which may cause patients to delay purchases of elective products. In the third and fourth quarters, our revenues have been higher because patients often spend the remaining balances in their flexible-spending accounts or because of lower out-of-pocket costs to patients who have met their annual deductibles under their health insurance plans. To the extent that the prevalence of high deductible insurance plans and higher copay and coinsurance plans continue to grow in the private payer market, the seasonal variations in our revenues could become even more pronounced.. Other factors that may cause fluctuation in our quarterly results or variations from our forecasts include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tphysician adoption of our products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttiming of new product offerings, acquisitions, licenses or other significant events by us or our competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunanticipated pricing pressure;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe hiring, retention and continued productivity of our sales representatives;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to expand the geographic reach of our sales and marketing efforts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for our products in development or for our current products outside the United States;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe impact of results from clinical research and trials on our existing products and products in development;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelays in receipt of anticipated purchase orders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelays in, or failure of, component deliveries from our suppliers; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpositive or negative coverage in the media or clinical publications of our products or products of our competitors or our industry.. 30. Table of Contents. In the event our actual revenues and operating results do not meet our forecasts or the forecasts or estimates of the research analysts that cover us for a particular period, the market price of our common stock may decline substantially.. We utilize third-party, single-source suppliers for some components and materials used in our products, and the loss of any of these suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business.. We rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers to supply all components and materials used in our Flexitouch, Entre and Actitouch systems. We rely on a single-source supplier for the controller in our Actitouch system. Our ability to supply our products commercially depends, in part, on our ability to obtain components and materials in accordance with our specifications and with regulatory requirements and in sufficient quantities to meet demand for our products. Our ability to obtain components and materials may be affected by matters outside our control, including that our suppliers may cancel our arrangements on short notice, we may be relatively less important as a customer to certain suppliers and our suppliers may have disruptions to their operations.. If we are required to establish additional or replacement suppliers for any of our components or materials, it may not be accomplished quickly and our operations could be disrupted. Even if we are able to find replacement suppliers, the replacement suppliers would need to be qualified and may require additional regulatory authority approval, which could result in further delay. In the event of a supply disruption, our product inventories may be insufficient to supply our patients.. If our third-party suppliers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of materials on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to find one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost in substantially equivalent volumes and quality on a timely basis, the continued commercialization of our products, the supply of our products to customers and the development of any future products would be delayed, limited or prevented, which could have an adverse impact on our business.. Consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions, which may impact our ability to sell our products at prices necessary to support our current business strategies.. Healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade, which has resulted in or led to numerous cost reform initiatives by legislators, regulators and third-party payers. Cost reform has triggered a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to aggregate purchasing power, which may create more requests for pricing concessions in the future. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the healthcare industry worldwide, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our payers, which may exert increasing downward pressure on the prices of our products in the future.. We may be unable to collect all of our Medicare accounts receivable.. At December 31, 2017, we had approximately $4.4 million of accounts receivable for sales of our Flexitouch system to patients covered by Medicare. A portion of the related claims to Medicare are initially denied and enter the appeals process, where many are ultimately reviewed by an Administrative Law Judge. The appeal process can be lengthy, lasting more than a year in most cases. At December 31, 2017, we classified $2.7 million of our Medicare accounts receivable related to Flexitouch system sales as long-term assets on our balance sheet due to the estimated amount of receivables that will be paid more than one year from December 31, 2017, as a result of delays with the Administrative Law Judge appeal process. A significant increase in Medicare denial of submitted claims or an increase in the proportion of Medicare denials that are upheld by an Administrative Law Judge could adversely affect our results of operations or cause us to reduce the carrying value of our Medicare accounts receivable related to Flexitouch system sales.. As an alternative to individual appeals, Medicare may seek to settle a number of outstanding appeals at one time through a settlement conference. On September 3, 2015, we entered into a settlement agreement with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, for 247 claims, representing approximately $1.5 million of original claims based on the Medicare allowable rates, in which we had submitted a request for an Administrative Law Judge hearing in 2013. The settlement entitled us to receive a payment of approximately $0.9 million. We received this full amount during the fourth quarter of 2015. The settlement resulted in a reduction in the fourth quarter of 2015 of $0.8 million in our accounts receivable for shipment of products to patients covered by Medicare. The settlement was facilitated by the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals to address a backlog of overdue claims awaiting Administrative Law Judge. 31. Table of Contents. adjudication. We cannot predict whether we will be able to conclude future settlements with Medicare or achieve settlements on similar terms. Any future settlement of claims for amounts less than the corresponding amounts receivable would result in a write off.. If physicians fail to properly document medical records for patients using our products, our business could be adversely impacted.. We bill Medicare Part B and other insurers directly for each sale to patients. As a result, we must comply with all laws, rules and regulations associated with filing claims with the Medicare program, including the Social Security Act, Medicare regulations, the Federal False Claims Act and the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, as well as a variety of additional federal and state laws. During an audit, insurers typically expect to find explicit documentation in the medical record to support a claim. Physicians and other clinicians, who are responsible for prescribing our products for patients, are expected to create and maintain the medical records that form the basis for the claims we submit to Medicare and other insurers. Any failure by physicians and other clinicians to properly document the medical records for patients using our products could invalidate claims, impair our ability to collect submitted claims and subject us to overpayment liabilities, False Claims Act liabilities and other penalties including exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance programs. Our payer relations group is responsible for verifying and managing patient claims. This group works with physicians and other clinicians to educate physicians and other clinicians on their record keeping responsibilities. From time to time our payer relations group identifies situations where the physician documentation could be questioned by Medicare or other insurers, and revises its procedures to strengthen our compliance systems based on our experience with Medicare contractors, Medicaid, insurers, physicians and other clinicians. If our procedures are not sufficient to detect deficiencies in the medical records of patients or such procedures are not updated in a timely manner before claims are submitted to Medicare or other insurers, or if the Medicare program or other insurer disagrees with the way physicians and other clinicians document the medical necessity support for prescribing our products, we could face potential liabilities for submitting claims based on inadequate records, even though those records are prepared and maintained by physicians and other clinicians.. Changes to the level of Medicare coverage or coverage criteria for our products could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. Determinations of which products or services will be reimbursed under Medicare can be developed at the national level through a National Coverage Determination, or  NCD, by CMS, or at the local level through a Local Coverage Determination, or  LCD, by the four regional Medicare Administrative Contractors, which are private contractors that process and pay claims on behalf of CMS for different regions. These NCDs and LCDs may be subject to review and revision from time to time, which revisions may not be favorable for coverage of our products. For example, an LCD released in December 2015 added restrictive criteria that impacts Medicare coverage of our Flexitouch system and our Entre system for certain patients. Additional LCDs or changes in LCDs for our products, could have adverse effects on our business. Further, we believe that a reduction in coverage by Medicare would likely cause some commercial third-party payers to implement similar reductions in their coverage or reimbursement of our products. Given the evolving nature of the healthcare industry and on-going healthcare cost reforms, we are and will continue to be subject to changes in the level of Medicare coverage for our products, and unfavorable coverage determinations at the national or local level could adversely affect our business and results of operations.. The size of the market for our products is an estimate, and may be smaller than we believe.. Our estimate of the total addressable market for our products is based on a number of internal and third-party estimates. In addition, our internal estimates are based in large part on current trends in diagnosing lymphedema and chronic venous insufficiency. While we believe these factors have historically provided and may continue to provide us with effective tools in estimating the total market for lymphedema, chronic venous insufficiency and our products, these estimates may not be correct and the conditions supporting our estimates may change at any time, thereby reducing the predictive accuracy of these underlying factors. As a result, our estimates of the total addressable market for our products may prove to be incorrect. If the actual number of patients who would benefit from our products and the total addressable market for our products is smaller than we have estimated, our future growth could be adversely impacted.. 32. Table of Contents. We may be unable to manage our growth effectively.. Our past growth has provided, and our future growth may create, challenges to our organization. For instance, from March 2005 to December 31, 2017, the number of our employees increased from 10 to 406. We intend to continue to grow and may experience periods of rapid growth and expansion. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on management, including the need to identify, recruit, train, integrate, retain and motivate additional employees. In addition, rapid and significant growth will place a strain on our administrative personnel, information technology systems and other operational infrastructure. Any failure by us to manage our growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals.. Successful growth is also dependent upon our ability to implement appropriate financial and management controls, systems and procedures. In order to manage our operations and growth, we will need to continue to improve our operational and management controls, reporting and information technology systems and financial internal control procedures. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, it may be difficult for us to execute our business strategy and there could be an adverse impact on our business.. Our ability to maintain our competitive position depends on our ability to attract, integrate and retain key executives and highly qualified personnel.. We believe that our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key personnel. Our executive officers and other key personnel are critical to the strategic direction and overall management of our company as well as our research and development process.. Our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain additional executive officers and other key employees. We invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. Many of our competitors have greater resources than we have that allows them to offer more competitive remuneration, which could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain experienced executives and other key employees. We carry a \"key person\" insurance policy on only our Chief Executive Officer. The replacement of any of our key personnel likely would involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and would harm our business. Our productivity may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively. Many of our employees have become or will soon become vested in a substantial amount of our common stock or a number of common stock options. Our employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares, or if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly below the market price of our common stock.. We face the risk of product liability claims that could be expensive, divert management's attention and harm our reputation and business. We may not be able to maintain adequate product liability insurance.. Our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical devices. This risk exists even if a device is cleared or approved for commercial sale by the FDA and manufactured in facilities licensed and regulated by the FDA or an applicable foreign regulatory authority. Our products are designed to affect, and any future products will be designed to affect, important bodily functions and processes. Any side effects, manufacturing defects, misuse or abuse associated with our products or our products in development could result in patient injury or death. The medical device industry has historically been subject to extensive litigation over product liability claims, and we cannot offer any assurance that we will not face product liability suits. We may be subject to product liability claims if our products cause, or merely appear to have caused, patient injury or death. In addition, an injury that is caused by the activities of our suppliers, such as those who provide us with components and materials, may be the basis for a claim against us. Product liability claims may be brought against us by patients, clinicians or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products, among others. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we will incur substantial liabilities and reputational harm. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcosts of litigation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdistraction of management's attention from our primary business;. 33. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability to commercialize our existing or new products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdecreased demand for our products or, if cleared or approved, products in development;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdamage to our business reputation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct recalls or withdrawals from the market;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twithdrawal of clinical trial participants;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of revenues.. While we may attempt to manage our product liability exposure by proactively recalling or withdrawing from the market any defective products, any recall or market withdrawal of our products would delay the supply of those products to our clinicians and patients and may impact our reputation. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in initiating appropriate market recall or market withdrawal efforts that may be required in the future or that these efforts will have the intended effect of preventing product malfunctions and the accompanying product liability that may result. Such recalls and withdrawals may also be used by our competitors to harm our reputation for safety or be perceived by patients as a safety risk when considering the use of our products, either of which could have an adverse impact on our business.. In addition, our product liability insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations. Our current product liability insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, and, if available, coverage may not be adequate to protect us against any future product liability claims. If we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we could be exposed to significant liabilities. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have an adverse impact on our business.. Changes in reimbursement coding could impair our ability to receive reimbursement for our products.. Our Flexitouch system is reimbursed under Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code E0652, and our Entre and Actitouch systems are reimbursed under HCPCS code E0651. Garments that cover various parts of the body are used with these systems and billed using HCPCS codes E0667, E0668 and E0669. HCPCS is a standardized system used by all U.S. insurance payers to provide descriptions of healthcare equipment, supplies and services. HCPCS codes are used by payers to identify what services are being billed and to assign payment rates to those specific services. HCPCS codes for durable medical equipment are assigned and managed by CMS and a Medicare contractor responsible for Pricing, Data Analysis and Coding, or PDAC. New products and product revisions must go through a coding verification process to confirm the products meet the requested HCPCS definitions. CMS or its contractor can review and revise coding assignments if they believe a product no longer meets the assigned HCPCS definition. If the PDAC contractor determines one of our products does not meet the current HCPCS definition, it could remove all coding or assign a different HCPCS code with a lesser payment rate. This could have an adverse impact on our reimbursement rates, results of operations and cash flows.. If the quality of our products does not meet the expectations of physicians or patients, then our brand and reputation could suffer and our business could be adversely impacted.. In the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues that may arise with our products, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. There can be no assurance that our internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from quality issues will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. If the quality of our products does not meet the expectations of physicians or patients, then our brand and reputation could suffer with those physicians or patients and our business could be adversely impacted.. 34.

If our facilities are damaged or become inoperable, we will be unable to continue to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize our products and, as a result, there will be an adverse impact on our business until we are able to secure a new facility.. We do not have redundant facilities. We perform substantially all of our research and development, assembly and back office activity and maintain all our finished goods inventory at two locations in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Our facilities and equipment would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. The facilities may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including, but not limited to, tornadoes, flooding, fire and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our research, development, manufacturing and commercialization activities for some period of time. The inability to perform those activities, combined with our limited inventory of reserve raw materials and finished product, may result in the inability to continue manufacturing our products during such periods and the loss of customers or harm to our reputation. Our insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses, and this insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.. We may be adversely affected by natural disasters and other catastrophic events, and by man-made problems such as terrorism, that could disrupt our business operations.. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may also cause damage or disruption to our operations, including causing delays in completing sales, continuing production or performing other critical functions of our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics, and other events beyond our control. In addition, acts of terrorism and other geo-political unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the businesses of our partners or the economy as a whole. In the event of a natural disaster, including a major earthquake, blizzard or hurricane, or a catastrophic event such as a fire, power loss, or telecommunications failure, we may be unable to continue our operations for a period of time in the affected area, which could have an adverse effect on our future operating results.. We may pursue acquisitions and our potential inability to successfully integrate newly acquired companies or businesses could adversely affect our financial results.. We may pursue acquisitions of other companies or their businesses in the future. If we complete acquisitions, we face many risks commonly encountered with growth through acquisitions. These risks include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincurring significantly higher than anticipated capital expenditures and operating expenses;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailing to assimilate the operations, customers, and personnel of the acquired company or business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisrupting our ongoing business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdissipating our management resources;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdilution to existing stockholders from the issuance of equity securities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tliabilities or other problems associated with the acquired business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincurring debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbecoming subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timproper compliance with laws and regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailing to maintain uniform standards, controls and policies; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timpairing relationships with employees and business partners as a result of changes in management.. 35. Table of Contents. Fully integrating an acquired company or business into our operations may take a significant amount of time. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with acquisitions. To the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems related to any acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Future acquisitions also could impact our financial position and capital needs, and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly results of operations. Acquisitions could include significant goodwill and intangible assets, which may result in future impairment charges that would reduce our stated earnings.. Failure to protect our information technology infrastructure against cyber-based attacks, network security breaches, service interruptions or data corruption could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operating results.. We rely extensively on information technology systems and telephone networks and systems, including the Internet, to process and transmit sensitive electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including sales, billing, customer service, procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, and distribution. We use enterprise information technology systems to record, process, and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent breakdowns in our information technology and telephone systems, if our systems suffer severe damage or disruption or shutdown and we are unable to effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business and operating results may suffer.. In addition, we accept payments for many of our sales through credit and debit card transactions, which are handled through a third-party payment processor. As a result, we are subject to a number of risks related to credit and debit card payments, including that we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and could require us to either increase the prices we charge for our products or experience an increase in our costs and expenses. In addition, as part of the payment processing process, we transmit our patients' and clinicians' credit and debit card information to our third-party payment processor. We may in the future become subject to lawsuits or other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of our patients' credit or debit card information if the security of our third-party credit card payment processor is breached. We and our third-party credit card payment processor are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we or our third-party credit card payment processor fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our patients, and there may be an adverse impact on our business.. We have no experience selling our products outside of the United States and cannot predict if we will be successful in achieving adoption of our products and revenue growth outside of the United States in a timely manner or at all. If we commercialize any products outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could impact our strategy and adversely affect our future growth.. We expect that we would be subject to additional risks related to entering into international markets, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulty successfully training patients and physicians on using our products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulty hiring a qualified direct-sales force or finding and entering into commercially-acceptable agreements with suitable third-parties to market our products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduced protection for intellectual property rights;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;. 36. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinternational regulators and third-party payers may require additional clinical studies prior to approving or allowing reimbursement for our products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, regulations of the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Controls, and U.S. anti-money laundering regulations, as well as exposure of our foreign operations to liability under these regulatory regimes; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.. If we experience any of these risks, our strategy to expand internationally could be impacted and our future growth could be adversely affected.. Our employees, independent contractors, consultants, collaborators and suppliers may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.. We are exposed to the risk that our employees and other third parties may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by employees and other third parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violate FDA regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA, manufacturing standards, federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, or laws that require the reporting of financial information or data accurately. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee and other third-party misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate.. A reclassification of our independent contractor home trainers by tax authorities could require us to pay retroactive taxes and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.. We contract with over 470 licensed healthcare practitioners as home trainers, who educate our patients on the proper use of our solutions. Because we consider these licensed practitioners to be independent contractors, as opposed to employees, we do not withhold federal or state income or other employment related taxes or make federal or state unemployment tax or Federal Insurance Contributions Act payments. Our contracts with these independent contractors obligate them to pay these taxes. The classification of healthcare practitioners as independent contractors depends on the facts and circumstances of the relationship. In the event federal or state taxing authorities determine that the healthcare practitioners are employees, our business may be adversely affected and subject to retroactive taxes and penalties. Under current federal tax law, a safe harbor from reclassification, and consequently retroactive taxes and penalties, is available if our current treatment is consistent with a long-standing practice of a significant segment of our industry and if we meet certain other requirements. If challenged, we may not prevail in demonstrating the applicability of the safe harbor. 37. Table of Contents. to our operations. Further, in the future there could be changes to the laws and rules in this area, including new or different interpretations or guidance, or the modification or elimination of the safe harbor. Any such changes in the law, rules or safe harbor, or new or different interpretations or guidance, could impact our classification of healthcare practitioners as independent contractors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We may be subject to liabilities related to state income, sales and use taxes, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and could decrease demand for our products.. State income tax and sales and use tax laws, statutes, rules and regulations vary greatly by jurisdiction and are complex and subject to uncertainty. We are in the process of reviewing the various requirements related to these types of taxes, but at this time we cannot predict the outcome of that review. If it is determined that certain of these tax rules apply to us, we could be required to pay substantial tax amounts, and significant penalties and interest for past amounts that may have been due, in addition to taxes going forward. These tax assessments, penalties and interest, and future requirements, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the imposition of sales and use taxes on our products going forward would effectively increase the cost of our products to our customers and may adversely affect demand for our products.. We have been required to conduct a good faith reasonable country of origin analysis on our potential use of conflict minerals, which has imposed and may impose additional costs on us and could raise reputational and other risks.. The SEC has promulgated final rules in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. While the status of these rules is uncertain, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. We have adopted a policy relating to conflict minerals, incorporating the standards set forth in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidance, which affects the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. As we continue our due diligence, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products through the procedures we have and may continue to implement. We may also encounter challenges in our efforts to satisfy customers that may require all of the components of products purchased to be certified as conflict-free. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier.. Risks Relating to Government Regulation. We are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, and if we fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could suffer severe criminal or civil sanctions or be required to make significant changes to our operations that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.. The federal government and all states in which we currently operate regulate various aspects of our business. Our operations also are subject to state laws governing, among other things, distribution of medical equipment and certain types of home health activities, and we are required to obtain and maintain licenses in each state to act as a durable medical equipment supplier.. As a healthcare provider participating in governmental healthcare programs, we are subject to laws directed at preventing fraud and abuse, which subject our marketing, billing, documentation and other practices to government scrutiny. To ensure compliance with Medicare, Medicaid and other regulations, government agencies or their contractors often conduct routine audits and request customer records and other documents to support our claims submitted for payment of services rendered. Government agencies or their contractors also periodically open investigations and obtain information from healthcare providers. Violations of federal and state regulations can result in severe criminal, civil and administrative penalties and sanctions, including debarment, suspension or exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other government reimbursement programs, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business.. Changes in healthcare laws and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may affect permissible activities, the relative costs associated with doing business, and reimbursement amounts paid by federal, state and other third-party payers. There have been and will continue to be regulatory initiatives affecting our business. 38. Table of Contents. and we cannot predict the extent to which future legislation and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We are subject to significant regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA. We cannot market or commercially distribute our products without obtaining and maintaining necessary regulatory clearances or approvals.. Our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation in the United States. The FDA and other U.S. and foreign governmental agencies regulate, among other things, with respect to medical devices:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdesign, development and manufacturing;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablishment registration and product listing;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttesting, labeling, content and language of instructions for use and storage;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tclinical trials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct safety;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmarketing, sales and distribution;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunique device identifiers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpremarket clearance and approval;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trecord keeping procedures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadvertising and promotion;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trecalls and field safety corrective actions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpost-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpost-market approval studies; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct import and export.. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we seek to distribute commercially in the United States requires marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval. The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device. When a 510(k) clearance is required, we must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that our proposed device is \"substantially equivalent\" to a legally marketed device previously found substantially equivalent through a 510(k) premarket notification, a legally marketed device which has been reclassified from high to low or moderate risk or a legally marketed device in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA does not require the submission of a premarket approval application. Such a device is commonly known as a ''predicate device.'' The FDA may require further  information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. A medical device may be found not to be equivalent if it has different intended uses from the predicate device or possesses different technological characteristics from the predicate device which raise new questions of safety and effectiveness. A premarket approval application must be submitted to the FDA if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. The premarket approval application process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process and requires the payment of significant user fees. A premarket approval application must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data to demonstrate the reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device. The approval process involves FDA review of information, including but not limited to, technical, pre-. 39. Table of Contents. clinical (bench and/or animal), clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling. The FDA clearance and approval processes frequently take longer than anticipated due to increasing FDA demands for clarification of data or new data requirements.. If there is no predicate device that would permit the device to be cleared through the 510(k) path, then the FDA will automatically classify the device as a Class III high risk premarket approval device. In the event of this possibility, the sponsor can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. A company files a de novo request when it does not have a predicate to which it can claim substantial equivalence. The FDA reviews the request for a de novo decision and grants or denies the request. If the request is granted, the FDA issues an order indicating that the device may legally be marketed and the device is classified as a Class I or II device, depending on risk. Once a device is classified through the de novo process, future devices from the company or a competitor may use that device as a 510(k) predicate. The advantage of the de novo process is that it generally requires less data than a premarket approval. The disadvantage is that it may require more data than a 510(k) and most often will include human clinical data. The FDA is increasingly moving devices with slightly different proposed indication statements or different technological features off the 510(k) path and on to the de novo path resulting in more time and expense for the company.. Both the 510(k) and premarket approval processes can be expensive and lengthy and require the payment of significant fees, unless an exemption applies. The FDA's 510(k) clearance process usually takes from approximately three to 12 months, but may take longer. The process of obtaining a premarket approval is much more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process and generally takes from approximately one to five years, or longer, from the time the application is submitted to the FDA until an approval is obtained. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming, and we may not be able to obtain these clearances or approvals on a timely basis, if at all.. In the United States, our currently commercialized products are marketed pursuant to premarket clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. If the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous examination for future products or modifications to existing products than we had expected, our product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled, which could cause our sales to decline. In addition, the FDA may determine that future products will require the more costly, lengthy and uncertain premarket approval process. Although we do not currently market any devices under a premarket approval, the FDA may demand that we obtain a premarket approval prior to marketing certain of our future products. In addition, if the FDA disagrees with our determination that a product we currently market is subject to an exemption from premarket review, the FDA may require us to submit a 510(k) or premarket approval application in order to continue marketing the product. Further, even with respect to those future products where a premarket approval is not required, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the 510(k) clearances required with respect to those products.. The FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a device for many reasons, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfor non-premarket approval devices, failure of the applicant to demonstrate to the FDA's satisfaction that its products meet the definition of \"substantial equivalence\" or meet the standard for the FDA to grant a petition for de novo classification;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure of the applicant to demonstrate that there is reasonable assurance that the medical device is safe or effective under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinsufficient data from the pre-clinical studies and clinical trials; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe manufacturing processes, methods, controls or facilities used for the manufacture, processing, packing or installation of the device do not meet applicable requirements.. Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, clearances or approvals for our products could prevent us from generating revenue from these products or achieving profitability. Additionally, the FDA and other governmental. 40. Table of Contents. authorities have broad enforcement powers. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could lead governmental authorities or a court to take action against us, including, but not limited to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tissuing untitled (notice of violation) letters or public warning letters to us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timposing fines and penalties on us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtaining an injunction or administrative detention preventing us from manufacturing or selling our products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tseizing products to prevent sale or transport or export;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbringing civil or criminal charges against us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trecalling our products or mandating a product correction;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdetaining our products at U.S. Customs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelaying the introduction of our products into the market;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelaying pending requests for clearance or approval of new uses or modifications to our existing products; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twithdrawing or denying approvals or clearances for our products.. If we fail to obtain and maintain regulatory clearances or approvals, our ability to sell our products and generate revenue will be materially harmed.. In addition, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis. For example, in response to industry and healthcare provider concerns regarding the predictability, consistency and rigor of the 510(k) regulatory pathway, the FDA published new guidance on the 510(k) regulatory pathway in 2014, which alters the manner in which the 510(k) regulatory pathway is administered and interpreted. The FDA intends these reform actions to improve the efficiency and transparency of the clearance process, as well as bolster patient safety. This new guidance could impose additional regulatory requirements upon us which could delay our ability to obtain new 510(k) clearances, increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances. In addition, as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, Congress reauthorized the Medical Device User Fee Amendments with various FDA performance goal commitments and enacted several \"Medical Device Regulatory Improvements\" and miscellaneous reforms which are further intended to clarify and improve medical device regulation both pre- and post-market.. Medical devices may only be promoted and sold for the indications for which they are approved or cleared. In addition, even if the FDA has approved or cleared a product, it can take action affecting such product approvals or clearances if serious safety or other problems develop in the marketplace. Delays in obtaining clearances or approvals could adversely affect our ability to introduce new products or modifications to our existing products in a timely manner, which would delay or prevent commercial sales of our products. Additionally, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Regulatory enforcement or inquiries, or other increased scrutiny on us, could affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our products and dissuade patients and clinicians from using our products.. If we modify our FDA cleared devices, we may need to seek additional clearances or approvals, which, if not granted, would prevent us from selling our modified products.. The FDA regulations require the submission and clearance of a new 510(k) premarket notification, or possibly, premarket approval, for significant changes or modifications made in the design, components, method of manufacture or intended use of a device including changes or modifications to a 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect the device's safety or effectiveness, or would constitute a major change or modification in the device's intended use. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination, but the FDA may review any manufacturer's decision. The. 41. Table of Contents. FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. We have modified some of our 510(k) cleared products, and have determined based on our review of the applicable FDA guidance that in certain instances new 510(k) clearances or premarket approval are not required. If the FDA disagrees with our determination and requires us to submit new 510(k) notifications or premarket approval for modifications to our previously cleared products for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.. Furthermore, the FDA's ongoing review of the 510(k) program may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to our previously cleared products, either by imposing more strict requirements on when a manufacturer must submit a new 510(k) for a modification to a previously cleared product, or by applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions. If the FDA requires us to cease marketing a modified device until we obtain a new 510(k) clearance or premarket approval, our business, financial condition, operating results and future growth prospects could be materially adversely affected. Further in this situation, our products could be subject to recall. Any recall or FDA requirement that we seek additional approvals or clearances could result in significant delays, fines, increased costs associated with modification of a product, loss of revenue and potential operating restrictions imposed by the FDA.. The misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our image in the marketplace, result in injuries that lead to product liability suits or result in costly investigations, fines or sanctions by regulatory bodies if we are deemed to have engaged in the promotion of these uses, any of which could be costly to our business.. The products we currently market have been cleared by the FDA for specific treatments. We train our marketing and direct sales force to not promote our products for uses outside of the FDA-cleared indications for use, known as \"off-label uses.\" We cannot, however, prevent a physician from using our products off-label, when in the physician's independent professional medical judgment he or she deems it appropriate. The FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician's choice of treatment. There may be increased risk of injury to patients if physicians use our products off-label. Furthermore, the use of our products for indications other than those cleared by the governing regulatory body may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients.. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials, communications or training constitute promotion of or encourage off-label uses, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of untitled letters, warning letters, injunctions, seizures, civil fines or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, and the curtailment of our operations.. In addition, physicians or patients may misuse our products or use improper techniques, potentially leading to injury and an increased risk of product liability. If our products are misused or used with improper technique, we may become subject to costly litigation by our clinicians or their patients. As noted above, we can be subject to lawsuits, whether or not our product is proven to be defective and whether or not our employees have adequately trained the physicians. Similarly, in an effort to decrease costs, physicians may also reuse those of our products that are intended for a single use or may purchase reprocessed products from third-party reprocessors in lieu of purchasing new products from us, which could result in product failure and liability. As described immediately above, product liability claims could divert management's attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and result in sizeable damage awards against us that may not be covered by insurance.. Our products may cause or contribute to adverse medical events that we are required to report to the FDA, and if we fail to do so, we would be subject to sanctions that would materially harm our business.. Our marketed products are subject to Medical Device Reporting, or MDR, obligations, which require that we report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or in which our products malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, it could likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. The timing of our obligation to report under the MDR regulations is triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events of which we become aware within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to recognize that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or. 42. Table of Contents. removed in time from the use of our products. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA could take action including warning letters, untitled letters, administrative actions, criminal prosecution, imposition of civil monetary penalties, revocation of our device clearances, seizure of our products, or delay in clearance of future products.. Our products may in the future be subject to product recalls. A recall of our products, either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products, could have a significant adverse impact on us.. The FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in their design or manufacture. The FDA's authority to require a recall must be based on a finding that there is reasonable probability that the device would cause serious, adverse health consequences or death. We may also choose to voluntarily recall a product if any material deficiency is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our reputation and business, which could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our patients' demands. We may also be subject to liability claims, be required to bear other costs, or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits.. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls and corrections, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary recalls or corrections for our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls and we may be subject to enforcement action.. If we or our component manufacturers fail to comply with the FDA's Quality System Regulation, our manufacturing operations could be interrupted, and our product sales and operating results could suffer.. We and many of our component manufacturers are required to comply with the FDA's Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which covers the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of our devices. The FDA audits compliance with the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing and other facilities. We and our component manufacturers have been, and anticipate in the future being, subject to such inspections. We cannot provide assurance that any future inspection will not result in adverse findings with respect to our QSR compliance. If our manufacturing facilities or those of any of our component manufacturers or suppliers are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations, or we or our manufacturers or suppliers fail to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection, the FDA could take enforcement action, including one or more of the following non-exclusive sanctions:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tuntitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcustomer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trefusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or modified products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twithdrawing 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals that have already been granted;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trefusal to grant export approval for our products; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcriminal prosecution.. Any of these sanctions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. If we begin selling our products outside the United States, our products and operations would also be required to comply with standards set by industrial standards bodies, such as the International Organization for Standardization, or. 43. Table of Contents. ISO. Foreign regulatory bodies may evaluate our products or the testing that our products undergo against these or other standards. The specific standards, types of evaluation and scope of review differ among foreign regulatory bodies. If we fail to adequately comply with any of these standards, a foreign regulatory body may take adverse actions similar to those within the power of the FDA.. Any of these actions could prevent us from marketing, distributing or selling our products and would likely harm our business.. If clinical studies of our future products do not produce results necessary to support regulatory clearance or approval in the United States or, with respect to our current or future products, elsewhere, we will be unable to expand the indications for or commercialize these products.. We will likely need to conduct additional clinical studies in the future to support new indications for our products or for clearances of new product lines, or for the approval of the use of our products in some foreign countries. Clinical testing can take many years, can be expensive and carries uncertain outcomes. The initiation and completion of any of these studies may be prevented, delayed, or halted for numerous reasons.. Clinical failure can occur at any stage of testing. Our clinical studies may produce negative, unanticipated or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical and non-clinical testing in addition to those we have planned. Our failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any of our devices would prevent receipt of regulatory clearance or approval and, ultimately, the commercialization of that device or indication for use. Even if our future products are cleared in the United States, commercialization of our products in foreign countries would require approval by regulatory authorities in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials. Any of these occurrences could have an adverse impact on our business.. If the third parties on which we rely to conduct our clinical trials and to assist us with pre-clinical development do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for or commercialize our products.. We often must rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations, have difficulty recruiting sufficient subjects for clinical studies or fail to meet expected deadlines, if these third parties need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our pre-clinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our products on a timely basis, if at all, and our business, operating results and prospects may be adversely affected. Furthermore, our third-party clinical trial investigators may be delayed in conducting our clinical trials for reasons outside of their control.. Future regulatory actions may adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.. From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the clearance or approval, manufacture and marketing of a medical device. In addition, FDA and other regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products, and new regulations or guidance documents may be promulgated. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or added, and what the impact of such changes or additions, if any, may be.. Healthcare regulatory reform may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.. In the United States, the legislative landscape, particularly as it relates to healthcare regulation and reimbursement coverage, continues to evolve. In March 2010 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was passed and substantially changed healthcare financing by both governmental and private insurers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes a new excise tax on entities that manufacture, produce or import medical devices in an amount equal to 2.3% of the price for which such devices are sold in the United States. However,. 44. Table of Contents. the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 included a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax.  Due to the moratorium, the medical device excise tax did not apply to the sale of a taxable medical device by the manufacturer, producer or importer of the device during the period beginning on January 1, 2016, and ending on December 31, 2017.  Additionally, H.R. 195 (Pub. L. 115-120), signed into law on January 22, 2018, extends for an additional two years the moratorium on the medical device excise tax. Because of the moratorium, the medical device excise tax does not apply to the sale of taxable medical devices by the manufacturer, producer or importer of the device during the period beginning on January 1, 2016, and ending on December 31, 2019. While we believe that our current products will be exempt from this tax under an exemption for retail products when the moratorium ends, if our belief is determined to be incorrect, we could be subject to additional tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash position. Moreover, products that we introduce or acquire in the future could be subject to this tax.. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011 requires, among other things, mandatory across-the-board reductions in Federal spending, also known as sequestration. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 postponed sequestration for two months. As required by law, President Obama issued a sequestration order on March 1, 2013. As a result of the sequestration order, Medicare Fee-for-Service claims with dates-of-service or dates-of-discharge on or after April 1, 2013 will continue to incur a 2% reduction in the Medicare payment until further notice. Claims for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies, including claims under the DME Competitive Bidding Program, are reduced by 2% based upon whether the date-of-service, or the start date for rental equipment or multi-day supplies, is on or after April 1, 2013.  We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures.. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Additional state and federal health care reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our customers. Any changes in, or uncertainty with respect to future reimbursement rates, or changes in hospital admission rates could impact our customers' demand for our products and services, which in turn could impact our ability to successfully commercialize our products, or could limit or eliminate our spending on certain development projects. These changes could adversely affect our business and results of operations.. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future revenues and profitability and the future revenues and profitability of our customers. Federal and state lawmakers regularly propose and, at times, enact legislation that results in significant changes to the healthcare system, some of which are intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services. The new presidential administration and U.S. Congress have sought, and we expect that they will continue to seek, to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact that the current administration and legislative action may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Such uncertainty and any changes could negatively impact our ability to successfully commercialize our products or product candidates, and could result in reduced demand for our products and additional pricing pressures.. While our products are not currently subject to the competitive bidding process under Medicare, if our products were to become subject to such process in the future, it could negatively affect our business and financial condition.. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish and implement programs under which competitive acquisition areas are established throughout the United States for purposes of awarding contracts for the furnishing of competitively priced items of durable medical equipment.. CMS, the agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, conducts a competition for each competitive acquisition area under which providers submit bids to supply certain covered items of durable medical equipment. Successful bidders must meet certain program quality standards in order to be awarded a contract and only successful bidders can supply the covered items to Medicare beneficiaries in the acquisition area. There are, however, regulations in place that allow non-contracted providers to continue to provide products and services to their existing customers at the new competitive bidding payment amounts. The contracts are expected to be re-bid every three years.. 45. Table of Contents. CMS is required to award contracts to multiple entities submitting bids in each area for an item or service, but has the authority to limit the number of contractors in a competitive acquisition area to the number it determines to be necessary to meet projected demand.. Although we continue to monitor developments regarding the implementation of the competitive bidding program, we cannot predict the outcome of the competitive bidding program on our business when fully implemented, nor the Medicare payment rates that will be in effect in future years for the items subjected to competitive bidding, including our products. We expect that payment rates will continue to fluctuate, and a large negative payment adjustment could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.. We are subject to additional federal, state and foreign laws and regulations relating to our healthcare business; our failure to comply with those laws could have an adverse impact on our business.. We are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by federal and state governments, which could adversely impact our business. Healthcare fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws potentially applicable to our operations include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which applies to our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies and relationships with healthcare providers, by prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, whether directly or indirectly and overtly or covertly, intended to induce the referral of an individual for (i) the furnishing or the arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid; or (ii) the purchase, lease or order of, or the arrangement or recommendation of the purchasing, leasing or ordering of, of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions that prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government, knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly offering remuneration to influence a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary's selection of health care providers. The government may assert that a claim, including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tHIPAA and its implementing regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, also imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfederal Open Payments (the Physician Payments Sunshine Act) requirements imposed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on device manufacturers regarding certain \"transfers of value\" made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.0 million per year for \"knowing failures\"), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission. Manufacturers must report detailed payment data and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data for each calendar year by the 90th day of the subsequent calendar year;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfederal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and. 46. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of certain health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. We are unable to predict what additional federal or state legislation or regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future regarding our business or the healthcare industry in general, or what effect such legislation or regulations may have on us. Federal or state governments may impose additional restrictions or adopt interpretations of existing laws that could have a material adverse effect on us.. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including certain sales and marketing practices and financial arrangements, including the provision of stock options as partial compensation for consulting services, with physicians, some of whom use or purchase our products, and other customers, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from governmental healthcare programs, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely impact our business.. Failure to comply with regulations affecting the transmission, security and privacy of health information could result in significant penalties.. Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including HIPAA and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or the HITECH Act, govern the collection, dissemination, security, use and confidentiality of patient-identifiable health information. HIPAA and the HITECH Act require us to comply with standards for the use and disclosure of health information within our company and with third parties. The Privacy Standards and Security Standards under HIPAA establish a set of basic national privacy and security standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, referred to as covered entities, and the business associates with whom such covered entities contract for services. Notably, whereas HIPAA previously directly regulated only these covered entities, the HITECH Act, which was signed into law as part of the stimulus package in February 2009, makes certain of HIPAA's privacy and security standards also directly applicable to covered entities' business associates. As a result, both covered entities and business associates are now subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with Privacy Standards and Security Standards.. HIPAA and the HITECH Act also include standards for common healthcare electronic transactions and code sets, such as claims information, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures, and privacy and electronic security of individually identifiable health information. Covered entities, such as healthcare providers, are required to conform to such transaction set standards pursuant to HIPAA.. HIPAA requires healthcare providers like us to develop and maintain policies and procedures with respect to protected health information that is used or disclosed, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. The HITECH Act expands the notification requirement for breaches of patient-identifiable health information, restricts certain disclosures and sales of patient-identifiable health information and provides a tiered system for civil monetary penalties for HIPAA violations. The HITECH Act also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Additionally, certain. 47. Table of Contents. states have adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA.. If we do not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to patient health information, we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions. New health information standards, whether implemented pursuant to HIPAA, the HITECH Act, congressional action or otherwise, could have a significant effect on the manner in which we handle healthcare related data and communicate with payers, and the cost of complying with these standards could be significant.. The 2013 final HITECH omnibus rule, or the HITECH Final Rule, modifies the breach reporting standard in a manner that makes more data security incidents qualify as reportable breaches. Any liability from a failure to comply with the requirements of HIPAA or the HITECH Act could adversely affect our financial condition. The costs of complying with privacy and security related legal and regulatory requirements are burdensome and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The HITECH Final Rule will be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us, as well as our clients and strategic partners. In addition, we are unable to predict what changes to the HIPAA Privacy Standards and Security Standards might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business. Any new legislation or regulation in the area of privacy and security of personal information, including personal health information, could also adversely affect our business operations.. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission has issued and several states have issued or are considering new regulations to require holders of certain types of personally identifiable information to implement formal policies and programs to prevent, detect and mitigate the risk of identity theft and other unauthorized access to or use of such information. Further, the U.S. Congress and a number of states have considered or are considering prohibitions or limitations on the disclosure of medical or other information to individuals or entities located outside of the United States. If we begin selling our products outside the United States, we will need to comply with applicable laws in those jurisdictions that regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable information.. If we fail to comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback, false claims and anti-inducement laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, whether directly or indirectly and overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal financed healthcare programs. The statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution are drawn narrowly, and any remuneration to or from a prescriber or purchaser of healthcare products or services may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability.. Federal false claims laws prohibit, in part, any person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making or causing to be made a false statement to get a false claim paid. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and Federal False Claims Act, which apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of payer. These false claims statutes allow any person to bring suit in the name of the government alleging false and fraudulent claims presented to or paid by the government (or other violations of the statutes) and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Such suits, known as qui tam actions, have increased significantly in the healthcare industry in recent years. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer's products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim, including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors and exceptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such. 48. Table of Contents. laws. Such a challenge, regardless of the outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business, business relationships, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.. In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements on device and drug manufacturers for any \"transfer of value\" made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers. Device and drug manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1.0 million per year for \"knowing failures to report\"), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. Manufacturers are required to collect data and are required to submit their data reports to CMS for each calendar year by the 90th day of the subsequent calendar year.. Certain states mandate implementation of compliance programs and/or the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company many violate one or more of the requirements.. The Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, in part, the offering or giving of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary's selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a Federal or state governmental program. We sometimes offer customers various discounts and other financial incentives in connection with the sales of our products. While it is our intent to comply with all applicable laws, the government may find that our marketing activities violate the Civil Monetary Penalties Law. If we are found to be in noncompliance, we could be subject to civil money penalties of up to $15,270 for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the Federal healthcare programs.. The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other government regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment, restructuring, or restricting of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring or our operations could harm our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state fraud laws may prove costly.. Failure to maintain the licenses and accreditations necessary to operate under our direct-to-patient and -provider model would adversely affect our business.. To continue operating our business under our direct-to-patient and -provider model, we must maintain our Durable Medical Equipment license and certification from the Accreditation Commission for Health Care. In May 2008, we became a Durable, Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies accredited Medicare supplier by the Accreditation Commission for Health Care for our solutions and our Medicare accreditation must be renewed every three years through passage of an on-site inspection. We last renewed our accreditation with Medicare in May 2017. In addition to maintaining our Durable Medical Equipment license and certification from the Accreditation Commission for Health Care, we also must maintain certain state-required licenses. If we were found to be noncompliant, we could lose our licensure in that state. Losing our licensure could prohibit us from selling our current or future products to patients in such state and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of any such prohibition.. Our products are currently made available to authorized users of the Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule and if we were no longer eligible to sell our products through such channel, our business may be adversely affected.. For our products to be eligible for reimbursement by the Veterans Administration, we must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule pricing program, established by Section 603 of the Veterans. 49. Table of Contents. Health Care Act of 1992. To be eligible for this program, we must comply with additional laws and requirements applicable to our operations and manufacturing processes. If we were to lose eligibility for reimbursement by the Veterans Administration, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.. We may be unable to obtain or maintain international regulatory registrations or approvals for our current or future products and indications, which could adversely impact our business.. Any future sales of our devices outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. In addition, the FDA regulates exports of medical devices from the United States. Complying with international regulatory requirements can be an expensive and time-consuming process and approval is not certain. The time required to obtain registration or approvals, if required by other countries, may be longer than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for such registrations or approvals may significantly differ from FDA requirements. In certain countries we intend to rely upon third-party distributors to obtain all required regulatory registrations and approvals, and these distributors may be unable to obtain or maintain such registrations or approvals. Our distributors in these countries may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and in maintaining foreign regulatory approvals or registrations, which could increase the difficulty of attracting and retaining qualified distributors. If these distributors experience delays in receiving necessary registrations or approvals to market our products outside the United States, or if they fail to receive those registrations or approvals, we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in certain international markets effectively, or at all.. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and toxic materials, and we must comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which can be expensive, and could have an adverse impact on our business.. Our operations use or generate small volumes of hazardous or toxic materials. We are therefore subject to a variety of federal, state and local regulations relating to the use, handling, storage, disposal and human exposure to hazardous and toxic materials. Liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault, and environmental laws could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, which could have an adverse impact on our business. There can be no assurance that violations of environmental, health and safety laws will not occur in the future as a result of human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes. The failure to comply with past, present or future laws could result in the imposition of fines, third-party property damage and personal injury claims, investigation and remediation costs, the suspension of production or a cessation of operations. We also expect that our operations will be affected by other new environmental and health and safety laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any such new laws and regulations, they will likely result in additional costs, and may require us to change how we manufacture our products, which could have an adverse impact on our business.. Risks Related to Our Financial Condition. We may need substantial additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which could force us to delay or reduce our commercialization efforts or product development programs.. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and revenues, will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements and fund our operations indefinitely. However, we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could spend our available financial resources much faster than we currently expect. Any future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmarket acceptance of our products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe scope, rate of progress and cost of our clinical studies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of our research and development activities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending and enforcing our patent or other intellectual property rights;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of defending, in litigation or otherwise, any claims that we infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property rights;. 50. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost and timing of additional regulatory clearances or approvals;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost and timing of establishing additional sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcosts associated with any product recall that may occur;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe effect of competing technological and market developments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe extent to which we acquire or invest in products, technologies and businesses, although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe costs of operating as a public company.. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Any future debt financing into which we enter may impose upon us covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If we do not have, or are not able to obtain, sufficient funds, we may have to delay development or commercialization of our products or license to third parties the rights to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to commercialize. We also may have to reduce marketing, customer support or other resources devoted to our products or cease operations. Any of these factors could harm our operating results.. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on products in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States may be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws, under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products, and further, competitors may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but enforcement rights are not as strong as those in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents, and our patent claims or other intellectual rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.. 51. Table of Contents. The patent protection for our products may expire before we are able to maximize their commercial value, which may subject us to increased competition and reduce or eliminate our opportunity to generate product revenues.. The patents for our products have varying expiration dates and, if these patents expire, we may be subject to increased competition and we may not be able to recover our development costs or market any of our approved products profitably. For instance, our U.S. patents for our Flexitouch system expired in 2017. Upon expiration of our patents, we may be subject to increased competition and our opportunity to establish or maintain product revenues could be substantially reduced or eliminated. Further, we may not have sufficient time to recover our development costs prior to the expiration of our U.S. and foreign patents.. We may not identify relevant patents or may incorrectly interpret the relevance, scope or expiration of a patent, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products.. We cannot guarantee that any of our patent searches or analyses, including but not limited to the identification of relevant patents, the scope of patent claims or the expiration of relevant patents, are complete or thorough, nor can we be certain that we have identified each and every patent and pending application in the United States and abroad that is relevant to or necessary for the commercialization of our products in any jurisdiction.. The scope of a patent claim is determined by an interpretation of the law, the written disclosure in a patent and the patent family's prosecution history. Our interpretation of the relevance or the scope of a patent or a pending application may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to market our products. We may incorrectly determine that our products are not covered by a third-party patent.. Many patents may cover a marketed product, including but not limited to patents covering the product or portions thereof, methods of use or methods relating to the product, and production processes of or for the product. The identification of all patents and their expiration dates relevant to the production and sale of a therapeutic product is extraordinarily complex and requires sophisticated legal knowledge in the relevant jurisdiction. It may be impossible to identify all patents in all jurisdictions relevant to a marketed product. Our determination of the expiration date of any patent in the United States or abroad that we consider relevant may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to develop and market our products.. Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent prosecution process. Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on any issued patent and/or pending patent applications are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of a patent or patent application. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we employ an outside firm and rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees. While an inadvertent lapse may sometimes be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are many situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications directed to our products, our competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than should otherwise have been the case, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.. We may become involved in lawsuits to protect our patents or other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time-consuming and ultimately unsuccessful.. Competitors may infringe our patents or other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.. 52. Table of Contents. Various proceedings brought before the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents and patent applications or those of our current or future collaborators. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if a prevailing party does not offer us a license on terms that are acceptable to us. Litigation or other proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distraction of our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential and proprietary information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.. Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation may adversely affect our business and could prevent us from developing or commercializing our products.. Our commercial success depends in part on us not infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions, ex-parte review and inter partes reexamination and post-grant review proceedings before the USPTO and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing and may develop our products. As the medical device industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our products may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. If a third party claims that we infringe on their products or technology, we could face a number of issues, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinfringement and other intellectual property claims which, with or without merit, can be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and can divert management's attention from our core business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsubstantial damages for past infringement, which we may have to pay if a court decides that our product infringes on a competitor's patent;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta court prohibiting us from selling or licensing our product, unless the patent holder licenses the patent to us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tif a license is available from a patent holder, we may have to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patents; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tredesigning our processes so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time.. Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to products, materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our products, that we failed to identify. For example, applications filed before November 29, 2000 and certain applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until issued as patents. Except for the preceding exceptions, patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are generally published only after a waiting period of approximately 18 months after the earliest filing. Therefore, patent applications covering our technology or our products could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our technologies, our products or the use or manufacture of our products. We may also face a claim of misappropriation, if a third party believes that we inappropriately obtained and used trade secrets of such third parties. If we are found to have misappropriated a third party's trade secrets, we may be prevented from further using such trade secrets, limiting our ability to develop our products, and we may be required to pay damages.. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our products, materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment, the holders of any such patents would be able to block. 53. Table of Contents. our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate until such patent expired or unless we obtain a license. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. In addition, during the course of any patent or other intellectual property litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, rulings on motions, and other interim proceedings in the litigation. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the perceived value of our products, programs, or intellectual property could be diminished. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock may decline.. Parties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our products. Defending against claims of patent infringement or misappropriation of trade secrets could be costly and time-consuming, regardless of the outcome. Thus, even if we were to ultimately prevail, or to settle at an early stage, such litigation could burden us with substantial unanticipated costs. In addition, litigation or threatened litigation could result in significant demands on the time and attention of our management team, distracting them from the pursuit of other company business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys' fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter into development collaborations that would help us bring our products to market.. Changes in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.. As is the case with other medical device companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly on obtaining and enforcing patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the medical device industry involves both technological and legal complexity, and therefore is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Further, several recent judicial rulings have either narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained.. For our U.S. patent applications containing a claim not entitled to priority before March 16, 2013, there is a greater level of uncertainty in the patent law. In September 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the American Invents Act, or AIA, was signed into law. The AIA includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted, reviewed after issuance, and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO is currently developing regulations and procedures to govern administration of the AIA and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the AIA. It is not clear what other, if any, impact the AIA will have on the operation of our business. Moreover, the AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.. An important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a \"first-inventor-to-file\" system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after that date but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours, even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require us to be cognizant, going forward, of the time from invention to filing of a patent application, but early filing of patent applications may not always be possible. Furthermore, our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents depends on whether the differences between our technology and the prior art allow our technology to be patentable over the prior art. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to either (a) file any patent application related to our products or (b) invent any of the inventions claimed in our patents or patent applications.. 54. Table of Contents. Among some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and provide opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all of our U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal court necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid as unpatentable, even though the same evidence may be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action.. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.. Because of the expense and uncertainty of litigation, we may not be in a position to enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties.. We have become aware from time to time that third parties may be infringing on our patents or other intellectual property rights. Because of the expense and uncertainty of litigation, we have concluded in the past and may conclude in the future that even if a third party is infringing our patents or other intellectual property rights, the risk-adjusted cost of bringing and enforcing such a claim or action may be too high or not in the best interest of our company or our stockholders. In such cases, we may decide that the more prudent course of action is to simply monitor the situation or initiate or seek some other non-litigious action or solution.. Intellectual property rights do not address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.. The degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain, because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOthers may be able to make products that are similar to our products but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or license from others..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOthers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or otherwise circumvent any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe might not have been the first to conceive and reduce to practice the inventions covered by the patents or patent applications that we own, license or will own or license..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain subject matter of the patents or patent applications that we own or for which we have obtained a license, or will own or for which we will obtain a license..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIt is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIssued patents that we own may not provide us with any competitive advantage, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights, or in countries where research and development safe harbor laws exist, and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOwnership of our patents or patent applications may be challenged by third parties..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe patents of third parties or pending or future applications of third parties, if issued, may have an adverse effect on our business.. 55. Table of Contents. Confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and protect other proprietary information.. We consider proprietary trade secrets and/or confidential know-how and unpatented know-how to be important to our business. We may rely on trade secrets and/or confidential know-how to protect our technology, especially where patent protection is believed by us to be of limited value. However, trade secrets and/or confidential know-how can be difficult to maintain as confidential.. To protect this type of information against disclosure or appropriation by competitors, our policy is to require our employees, consultants, contractors and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements with us. However, current or former employees, consultants, contractors and advisers may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors, and confidentiality agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Enforcing a claim that a third party obtained illegally and is using trade secrets and/or confidential know-how is expensive, time consuming and unpredictable. The enforceability of confidentiality agreements may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secrets and/or confidential know-how trade protection could adversely affect our competitive position. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and may even apply for patent protection in respect of the same. If successful in obtaining such patent protection, our competitors could limit our use of our trade secrets and/or confidential know-how.. We may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.. A third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development or commercialization of any future products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could materially harm our business.. We may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.. We have received confidential and proprietary information from third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other medical device companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise improperly used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees' former employers. Further, we may be subject to ownership disputes in the future, arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our products. We may also be subject to claims that former employees, consultants, independent contractors, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging our right to and use of confidential and proprietary information. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose our rights therein. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.. We may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.. We may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. We may be subject to ownership disputes in the future, arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our products. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.. 56. Table of Contents. Our reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.. Because we rely on third parties to assist with research and development and to manufacture our products, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants, prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor's discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business.. In addition, these agreements typically restrict the ability of our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants to publish data potentially relating to our trade secrets, although our agreements may contain certain limited publication rights. For example, any academic institution that we may collaborate with in the future will usually expect to be granted rights to publish data arising out of such collaboration, provided that we are notified in advance and given the opportunity to delay publication for a limited time period in order for us to secure patent protection of intellectual property rights arising from the collaboration, in addition to the opportunity to remove confidential or trade secret information from any such publication. In the future, we may also conduct joint research and development programs that may require us to share trade secrets under the terms of our research and development or similar agreements. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, our competitors may discover our trade secrets, either through breach of our agreements with third parties, independent development or publication of information by any of our third-party collaborators. A competitor's discovery of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and have an adverse impact on our business.. If our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.. If our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest, and our business may be adversely affected. We currently have registered and unregistered trademarks in the United States. Our trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition among potential collaborators or customers in our markets of interest. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. Further, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other trademarks or trade names that incorporate variations of our trademarks or trade names. In addition, we have not registered our trademarks internationally, and the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Over the long term, if we are unable to successfully register our trademarks and trade names and/or establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock. The trading price of the shares of our common stock has been and could continue to be highly volatile, and purchasers of our common stock may not be able to resell the shares of our common stock at or above the price at which they purchased their shares and could incur substantial losses.. Our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. The stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this. 57. Table of Contents. volatility, investors may not be able to sell their shares of our common stock at or above the price at which they purchased their shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe passage of legislation or other regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactual or anticipated variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems, especially in light of current or proposed reforms to the U.S. healthcare system;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to develop and commercialize additional products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures or capital commitments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmarket conditions in medical device sectors and issuance of securities analysts' research reports or recommendations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsales of our stock by us, our insiders and our other stockholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe trading volume of our common stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tspeculation in the press or investment community;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic, industry and market conditions, or other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadditions or departures of key personnel; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tintellectual property, product liability or other litigation against us.. In addition, the stock market has recently experienced significant volatility with respect to medical device and other life sciences company stocks. The volatility of medical device and other medical technology company stocks often does not relate to the operating performance of the companies represented by the stock. As we operate in a single industry, we are especially vulnerable to these factors to the extent that they affect our industry or our products, or to a lesser extent our markets.. We are an \"emerging growth company,\" and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.. We are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act and may remain an emerging growth company for up to five years following our initial public offering. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnot being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnot being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and. 58. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.. We have taken advantage of reduced reporting burdens in this report. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be reduced or more volatile. In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of these accounting standards until they would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption and, as a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers that are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be reduced or more volatile.. We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation, if any, in the price of our common stock.. We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business. In addition, any future debt financing arrangement may contain terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to any appreciation of their stock. Therefore, the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders purchased their shares.. We are incurring increased costs and are subject to additional regulations and requirements as a result of being a public company, which could lower our profits or make it more difficult to run our business.. As a public company, we are incurring significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. These laws and regulations also could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as our executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.. If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, investors' views of us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is required to report upon the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning with this Annual Report on Form 10-K. When and if we are a \"large accelerated filer\" or an \"accelerated filer\" and are no longer an \"emerging growth company,\" each as defined in the Exchange Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of an exemption available to emerging growth companies from these auditor attestation requirements. We could be an \"emerging growth company\" for up to five years following our initial public offering. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation. To comply with the requirements of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act, we may need to upgrade our systems, including information. 59. Table of Contents. technology; implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems, and procedures; and hire additional accounting and finance staff.. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.. In addition, we may encounter problems or delays in implementing any changes necessary to make a favorable assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Further, once we are no longer an emerging growth company, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements and receiving a favorable attestation in connection with the attestation provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. If we cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our internal controls, investors could lose confidence in our financial information and the trading price of our common stock could decline.. In connection with our evaluations of our internal control over financial reporting, we may need to upgrade our systems or create new systems, implement additional financial and management controls, update our reporting systems and procedures, create or outsource an internal audit function or hire additional accounting and finance staff. If we are unable to accomplish these objectives in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with the financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.. Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. These provisions include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tauthorizing the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimiting the removal of directors by the stockholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow for less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.. These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. These provisions. 60. Table of Contents. would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, the price of our common stock and our trading volume could decline.. The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If too few securities or industry analysts commence or maintain coverage of our company, the trading price for our common stock would likely be negatively affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause the price of our shares and trading volume to decline.. Claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.. In addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated bylaws and our indemnification agreements with our directors and officers provide that:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe will not be obligated pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person against us or our other indemnitees, except with respect to proceedings authorized by our board of directors or brought to enforce a right to indemnification..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe may not retroactively amend our bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents."
