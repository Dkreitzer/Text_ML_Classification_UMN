[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our business is subject to a number of risks. In addition to the various risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report, the following risk factors should be considered.. <U+FEFF>. Risk Factors Relating to Our Industry and Our Business. A downturn in the global economy could adversely affect demand for automobiles that are manufactured with our products and therefore, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. The level of demand for our products depends primarily upon the level of consumer demand for new vehicles that are manufactured with our products. As experienced in 2008 and 2009, a global economic recession can have a significant adverse effect on our business, customers, and suppliers, and can contribute to delayed and reduced purchases of automobiles, including those manufactured with our products. If the global economy were to undergo a significant downturn, depending upon its length, duration, and severity, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. Demand for and pricing of our products is also subject to economic conditions and other factors (e.g., energy costs, fuel costs, climate change concerns, vehicle age, consumer spending and preferences, materials used in production, changing technology, etc.) present in the various domestic and international markets in which our products are sold.. <U+FEFF>. We may be unable to realize revenues represented by our awarded business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. The realization of future revenues from awarded business is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including the number of vehicles that our customers will actually produce, the timing of that production, and the mix of options that our customers may choose.. <U+FEFF>. In addition to not having a commitment from our customers regarding the minimum number of products they must purchase from us if we obtain awarded business, the terms and conditions of the agreements with our customers typically provide that they have the contractual right to unilaterally terminate our contracts with them without notice or with only limited notice. If such contracts are terminated by our customers, our ability to obtain compensation from our customers for such termination is generally limited to the direct out-of-pocket costs that we incurred for raw materials and work-in-progress, and in certain instances, un-depreciated capital expenditures.. <U+FEFF>. We base a substantial part of our planning on the anticipated lifetime revenues of particular products. We calculate the lifetime revenues of a product by multiplying our expected price for a product by the forecasted production volume for that product during the length of time we expect the related vehicle to be in production. In addition to applying our experienced judgment to customer projections, we use IHS, a third-party forecasting service, to provide long-term forecasts, which allow us to determine how long a vehicle is expected to be in production. If we over-estimate the production units or if a customer reduces its level of anticipated purchases of a particular platform as a result of reduced demand, our actual revenues for that platform may be substantially less than the lifetime revenues we had anticipated for that platform.. <U+FEFF>. Typically, it takes two to three years from the time a manufacturer awards a program until the program is launched and production begins. In many cases, we must commit substantial resources in preparation for production under awarded customer business well in advance of the customer's production start date. We cannot provide assurance that our results of operations will not be materially adversely affected in the future if we are unable to recover these types of pre-production costs related to our customers' cancellation of awarded business or if projected volumes are not attained.. <U+FEFF>. The automobile industry is highly cyclical and a downturn would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. Our business is directly related to the volume of automotive production. Automotive production and sales are highly cyclical and depend on general economic conditions and other factors, including interest rates, consumer confidence, consumer preferences, patterns of consumer spending, fuel costs, and the automobile replacement cycle. Automotive production and sales may fluctuate significantly from year-to-year and such fluctuations may give rise to changes in demand for our products. Because we have significant fixed production costs, declines in our customers' production levels can have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. The highly cyclical nature of the automotive industry presents a risk that is outside our control and that cannot be accurately predicted. Moreover, a number of factors that we cannot reasonably predict could affect cyclicality in the automotive industry, and have affected cyclicality in the past. Decreases in demand for automobiles generally, or decreases in demand for our products in particular, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. 13. Our substantial international operations make us vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries.. Our international operations include manufacturing facilities in Europe and Mexico. For the year ended December 31, 2017,  approximately 36% of our revenues were derived from operations outside the United States. Our international operations are subject to various risks that could have a material adverse effect on those operations and our business as a whole, including, but not limited to, exposure to the following in certain locations:. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlocal economic and political conditions;. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlocal civil and social unrest, including any resultant acts of war, terrorism or similar events;. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlocal public health issues;. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlocal tax requirements and obligations;. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations;. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thigh inflationary conditions;. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe risk of government-sponsored competition;. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlegal and regulatory concerns, including difficulty enforcing agreements and collecting receivables;. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontrols on the repatriation of cash, including the imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texport and import restrictions;. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlabor disruptions and operational shutdowns;. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnatural and man-made disasters; and. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlocal environmental regulations.. Additionally, the economic instability in Mexico and other countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as adversely affect our access to, and cost of, capital.. <U+FEFF>. We are dependent upon large customers for current and future revenues. The loss of any of these customers, or the loss of market share by these customers, could have a material adverse effect on us.. Our customers are major vehicle manufacturers. During 2017,  our largest volume customers, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, Volkswagen Group, Nissan, Volvo, and Toyota accounted for 35%,  20%,  11%,  10%,  7%, and 5% of our revenues, respectively. The loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to any of our large-volume customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows by reducing cash flows and limiting our ability to spread our fixed costs over a larger revenue base. A variety of reasons could lead to a reduction of sales to our customers, including, but not limited to:. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of awarded business;. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduced or delayed customer requirements;. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOEMs' choosing to insource business that has been traditionally outsourced to us;. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstrikes or other work stoppages affecting customer production; or. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduced demand for our customers' products.. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. 14. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations could cause a decline in our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. We generate a significant portion of our revenues and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. Appreciation of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies will generally have an adverse effect on our reported sales and profits, while depreciation of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies will generally have a positive effect on reported revenues and profits.. <U+FEFF>. We may use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to protect against certain foreign currency exchange rate risks (see Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information relating to our swaps). Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial effect resulting from foreign currency variations. The gains or losses associated with hedging activities may adversely affect our results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. The Trump Administration could make substantial changes to regulatory, fiscal, trade, and other policies that could adversely affect our business.. The Trump Administration has called for substantial changes to regulatory, fiscal and other policies, which may include significant changes to trade agreements currently in effect. We cannot predict the impact, if any, of these changes to our business. However, it is possible that these changes could adversely affect our business. It is likely that some policies adopted by the administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us. Until we know what new changes are enacted, we will not know whether in total we benefit from, or are negatively affected by such changes.. <U+FEFF>. Deterioration in the United States and world economies could adversely affect our customers' and suppliers' ability to access the capital markets, which may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. The capital and credit markets provide companies with liquidity to help operate and grow their businesses, beyond that which is provided by operating cash flows. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our customers by making it increasingly difficult for them to obtain financing for their businesses and for their customers to obtain financing for automobile purchases. Our OEM customers typically require significant financing for their respective businesses. In addition, our OEM customers typically have related finance companies that provide financing to their dealers and customers. These finance companies have historically been active participants in the securitization markets, which experienced severe disruptions during the global economic crisis. Our suppliers, as well as the other suppliers to our customers, may face similar difficulties in obtaining financing for their businesses. If capital is not available to our customers or suppliers, or if the cost of capital is prohibitively high, their businesses would be adversely affected, which could result in their restructuring or even reorganization or liquidation under applicable bankruptcy laws. Any such adverse effect on our customers or suppliers could materially and adversely affect our Company, either through loss of revenues from any of our customers so affected, or due to our inability to meet our commitments without excess expense, as a result of disruptions in supply caused by the suppliers so affected.. <U+FEFF>. Financial difficulties experienced by any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on us if such customer were unable to pay for the products we provide or if we experienced a loss of, or material reduction in, business from such customer. As a result of such difficulties, we could experience lost revenues, significant write-offs of accounts receivable, significant impairment charges, or additional restructurings beyond the steps we have taken to date.. <U+FEFF>. Any acquisitions or divestitures we make could disrupt our business and materially harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. We may, from time to time, consider certain acquisitions or divestitures. Acquisitions and divestitures involve numerous risks, including identifying attractive target acquisitions, undisclosed risks affecting the target, difficulties integrating acquired businesses, the assumption of unknown liabilities, potential adverse effects on existing business relationships with current customers and suppliers, the diversion of our management's attention from other business concerns, and decreased geographic or customer diversification.. <U+FEFF>. We cannot provide assurance that any acquisitions or divestitures will perform as planned or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow, or that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquisitions that we undertake. Any such failure could seriously harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that is underfunded and requires annual cash payments. If the performance of the assets in our pension plan does not meet our expectations, or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, our required contributions may be higher than we expect.. We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that is underfunded. While this plan is frozen as benefit accruals under the plan have ceased, the plan will require annual cash payments in order to meet our funding obligations, which adversely affects our cash flow.. <U+FEFF>. Additionally, our earnings may be affected by the amount of income or expense recorded for our pension plan. GAAP requires that income or expense of  a pension plan be calculated at the annual measurement date using actuarial assumptions, the most significant of. 15. which relate to the capital markets, interest rates, and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change these assumptions. These assumptions, along with the actual value of assets at the measurement date, will impact the calculation of pension expense for the year. Although GAAP expense and pension contributions are not directly related, the key economic indicators that affect GAAP expense also affect the amount of cash that we would contribute to our pension plan. The investment portfolio of the pension plan has experienced volatility. Because the values of these pension plan assets have fluctuated, and will fluctuate in response to changing market conditions, the amount of gains or losses that will be recognized in subsequent periods, the impact on the funded status of the pension plan, and the future minimum required contributions, if any, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. The decreasing number of automotive parts suppliers and pricing pressures from our automotive customers could make it more difficult for us to compete in the highly competitive automotive industry.. The automotive parts industry is highly competitive and bankruptcies and consolidation among automotive parts suppliers are reducing the number of competitors and resulting in larger competitors who benefit from purchasing and distribution economies of scale. Our inability to compete with these larger suppliers in the future could result in a reduction of, or inability to increase, revenues, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. Although the overall number of competitors is decreasing due to ongoing industry consolidation, we face significant competition within each of our major product areas. The principal competitive factors include quality, global presence, service, cost, product performance, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation, and timely delivery. We also face significant competitive pricing pressures from our automotive customers. Because of their purchasing size, our automotive customers can influence market participants to compete on price terms. If we are not able to offset pricing reductions resulting from these pressures by improving operating efficiencies and reducing expenditures, those pricing reductions may have a material adverse effect on our business.. <U+FEFF>. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to continue to compete in the highly competitive automotive industry or that increased competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business.. <U+FEFF>. The volatility of steel prices may adversely affect our results of operations.. We utilize steel and various purchased steel products in virtually all of our products. We refer to the \"net steel impact\" as the combination of the change in steel prices that are reflected in the price of our products, the change in the cost to procure steel from mills, and the change in our recovery of scrap steel (which we refer to as \"offal\"). Our strategy is to be economically neutral to steel pricing by having these factors offset each other. While we strive to achieve a neutral net steel impact, we are not always successful in achieving that goal, in large part due to timing differences. The timing of a change in the price for steel may occur in separate periods and if a change occurs, that change may have a disproportionate effect on our liquidity because of the time difference between our payment for steel and our collection of cash from customers. We tend to pay for replacement materials, which are more expensive when steel prices are rising, over a much shorter period. As a result, rising steel prices may cause us to draw greater than anticipated amounts from our credit lines to cover the cash flow cycle from our steel purchases to cash collection for related accounts receivable. This cash requirement for working capital is higher in periods when we are increasing our inventory quantities.. <U+FEFF>. A by-product of our production process is the generation of offal. We typically sell offal in secondary markets, which are similar to the steel markets. We generally share our recoveries from sales of offal with our customers either through scrap sharing agreements, in cases in which we are participating in resale programs, or through product pricing, in cases in which we purchase steel directly from steel mills. In either situation, we may be affected by the fluctuation in scrap steel prices, either positively or negatively, in relation to our various customer agreements. As offal prices generally increase and decrease as steel prices increase and decrease, our sale of offal may mitigate the impact of the volatility of steel price increases, as well as limit the benefits reaped from steel price declines. Any volatility in offal and steel prices could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. We have a material amount of goodwill, which, if it becomes impaired, would result in a reduction in our net income and equity.. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. GAAP requires that goodwill be periodically evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the reporting unit. As of December 31, 2017, we had $63.7 million of goodwill that could be subject to impairment. Declines in our profitability or the value of comparable companies may impact the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a write-down of goodwill and a reduction of net income.. <U+FEFF>. Disruptions in the automotive supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. Automotive industry conditions could adversely affect the original equipment supply base. The automotive supply chain is subject to disruptions because we, along with our customers and suppliers, attempt to maintain low inventory levels.. <U+FEFF>. 16. Disruptions could result from a multitude of potential problems, such as the closure of one of our or our suppliers' plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical breakdowns, electrical outages, fires, explosions, or political upheaval. Disruptions could also result from logistical complications due to weather, earthquakes, or other natural or nuclear disasters, mechanical failures, technology disruptions, or delayed customs processing.. <U+FEFF>. If we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production, the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us. Any disruptions affecting us or caused by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. The inability for us, our customers, or our suppliers to obtain and maintain sufficient credit insurance or capital financing, including working capital lines, may adversely affect the liquidity and financial condition of us, our customers, and our suppliers.. Our working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending, in part, on the level, variability and timing of our customers' vehicle production and the payment terms we have with our customers and suppliers. Our liquidity could also be adversely affected if our suppliers were to suspend normal trade credit terms and require payment in advance or payment on delivery. If our available cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fund our ongoing cash needs, we would be required to look to our cash balances and borrowing availability under our credit facilities to satisfy those needs, as well as look to potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms or in adequate amounts, if at all.. <U+FEFF>. There can be no assurance that we, our customers, or our suppliers will continue to have the ability to maintain sufficient capital financing. This may increase the risk of not being able to produce our products or having to pay higher prices for our inputs that may not be recovered in our selling prices. Our suppliers often seek to obtain credit insurance based on our consolidated financial condition and strength, which may be less robust. If we were to experience liquidity issues, our suppliers may not be able to obtain credit insurance and, in turn, would likely not be able to offer us payment terms that we have historically received, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.. <U+FEFF>. We may incur costs of a material nature related to plant closings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. If we must close manufacturing locations because of lost business or consolidation of manufacturing facilities, the employee termination costs, asset retirements, and other exit costs associated with the closure of these facilities may be significant. In certain circumstances, we may close a manufacturing facility that is operated under a lease agreement and we may continue to incur material costs in accordance with the lease agreement. We attempt to align production capacity with demand; however, we cannot provide assurance that plants will not have to be closed.. <U+FEFF>. We are subject to environmental risks and requirements and we may incur significant costs, liabilities, and obligations associated with those risks and requirements.. We are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws, regulations, and permits that govern, among other things, soil, surface water, and groundwater contamination; the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal, and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of materials, including GHGs, into the environment; and health and safety. If we fail to comply with these laws, regulations, or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators or become subject to litigation. Environmental and pollution control laws, regulations, and permits, and the enforcement thereof, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time, and may necessitate substantial capital expenditures or operating costs.. <U+FEFF>. Under certain environmental requirements, we could be responsible for costs relating to any contamination at our, or the Predecessor Company's, currently or formerly owned or operated properties or third-party waste-disposal sites, even if we were not at fault. Soil and groundwater contamination is being addressed at certain of these locations. In addition to potentially significant investigation and cleanup costs, contamination can give rise to third-party claims for fines or penalties, natural resource damages, personal injury, or property damage.. <U+FEFF>. We cannot provide assurance that our costs, liabilities, and obligations relating to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. A disruption in our information technology systems, including a disruption related to cybersecurity, could adversely affect our financial performance.. <U+FEFF>. We rely on the accuracy, capacity and security of our information technology systems. Despite the security measures that we have implemented, including those measures related to cybersecurity, our systems could be breached or damaged by computer viruses, natural or man-made incidents or disasters or unauthorized physical or electronic access. A breach could result in business disruption, theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information and unauthorized access to personnel information. To the extent that our. 17. business is interrupted or data is lost, destroyed or inappropriately used or disclosed, such disruptions could materially and adversely affect our competitive position, relationships with our customers, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.. <U+FEFF>. Risk Factors Relating to Our Indebtedness. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial health and our ability to fund our operations, obtain financing in the future, and react to changes in our business.. As of December 31, 2017, our total debt, including capital lease obligations and net of debt issue costs,  was $386.8 million. That indebtedness could:. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadversely affect our stock price;. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our financing arrangements;. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and general industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, because a portion of our borrowings have, and will continue to have, variable interest rates;. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes;. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tplace us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt;. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing due to financial and restrictive covenants included in our debt agreements; and. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincrease our cost of borrowing.. <U+FEFF>. Our primary debt instrument is the Term Loan Credit Facility which bears interest at (i) the Alternate Base Rate plus a margin of 1.75% or (ii) the Adjusted LIBO Rate (calculated by multiplying the applicable LIBOR by a statutory reserve rate, with a floor of 1.00%) plus a margin of 2.75%. As of December 31, 2017, the balance on the term loan was $356.5 million (net of a $2.3 million discount). If the LIBOR rates increase in excess of 1%, we will incur higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results. While we periodically enter into agreements designed to limit our exposure to higher interest rates, any such agreements do not offer complete protection from this risk.. <U+FEFF>. We may not be able to refinance our debt on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to refinance, extend the maturity of, or otherwise amend the terms of our existing indebtedness, or that any refinancing, extension, or amendment will be on commercially reasonable terms. The indebtedness issued in any refinancing of our existing indebtedness could have a significantly higher rate of interest and greater costs than our existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that the financial terms or covenants of any new credit facility or other indebtedness issued to refinance our existing indebtedness will be the same or as favorable as those under our existing indebtedness.. <U+FEFF>. Our ability to complete a refinancing of our existing indebtedness prior to their respective maturities is subject to a number of conditions beyond our control. For example, if a disruption in the financial markets were to occur at the time that we intended to refinance this indebtedness, we might be restricted in our ability to access the financial markets. Also, if we were unable to make payments or refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we would have to consider other options, such as:. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsales of assets;. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsales of equity; or. <U+FEFF>. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnegotiations with lenders and their respective agents to restructure the applicable debt.. Our debt instruments may restrict, and market or business conditions may limit, our ability to employ some of our options.. <U+FEFF>. 18. In addition, under our credit agreements, a change in control may lead the lenders to exercise remedies such as acceleration of the loan, termination of their obligations to fund additional advances and collection against the collateral securing such loan.. <U+FEFF>. We may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under such indebtedness, which may not be successful.. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations, certain of which have short-term maturities, depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions, as well as financial, business, and other factors beyond our control.

Substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries' assets are pledged as collateral for these obligations. If we are unable to repay all secured borrowings when due, whether at maturity or if declared due and payable following a default, the agent or the lenders, as applicable, would have the right to proceed against the collateral pledged to secure the indebtedness and may sell the assets pledged as collateral in order to repay those borrowings, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. 19.
