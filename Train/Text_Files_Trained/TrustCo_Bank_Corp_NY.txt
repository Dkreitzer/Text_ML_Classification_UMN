[1] "Item 1A.  Risk Factors. The following are general risk factors affecting the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business operations. Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In such cases, you may lose all or part of your investment.. Certain interest rate movements may hurt earnings and asset values.. Like other financial institutions, we are subject to interest rate risk. Our primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments, and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Over any specific period of time, our interest-earning assets may be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-bearing liabilities, or vice-versa. In addition, the individual market interest rates underlying our loan and deposit products may not change to the same degree over a given time period. In any event, if market interest rates should move contrary to our position, earnings may be negatively affected. Interest rates have in recent years hit historical low levels. From December 2008 through December 2015, the U.S. Federal Reserve held its target for the federal funds rate at a range of 0.00% to 0.25%. Starting in December 2015, the Federal Reserve started increasing the target range; on December 14, 2017, the FRB increased the target range by 0.25% to a range of 01.25% to 1.50%. While the likelihood of further increases in the rate is uncertain, the FRB's Federal Open Market Committee indicated that \"…expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate.\"  Most economists and financial market indicators concur that there will be additional increases in rates.  Lower rates have helped lead to a lower cost of funds, but have also lowered the yields we earn on loans, securities, and short-term investments. To the extent that the Federal Reserve raises rates further, our cost of funds may rise faster than the rates we earn on loans and investments, potentially causing a compression of our interest rate spread and net interest margin, which would have a negative effect on Trustco Bank's profitability.. We also are subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage-related securities. Increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or may make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans. Decreases in interest rates often result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance their loans to reduce borrowings costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments in loans or other investments that have interest rates that are comparable to the interest rates on existing loans and securities. Conversely, increases in interest rates often result in slowed prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, reducing cash flows and reinvestment opportunities.. Changes in interest rates also affect the value of the Bank's interest-earning assets, and in particular the Bank's securities portfolio. Generally, the value of fixed-rate securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as a separate component of equity, net of tax. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on shareholders' equity.. We are exposed to credit risk in our lending activities.. There are inherent risks associated with our lending and trading activities. Loans to individuals and business entities, our single largest asset group, depend for repayment on the willingness and ability of borrowers to perform as contracted. A material adverse change in the ability of a significant portion of our borrowers to meet their obligation to us, due to changes in economic conditions, interest rates, natural disaster, acts of war, or other causes over which we have no control, could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans, and could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition.. 15. Index. If our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.. Our borrowers may not repay their loans according to the terms of the loans, and, as a result of the declines in home prices, the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. We may experience significant loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. When determining the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses (\"ALLL\"), we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In deciding on the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, management reviews past due information, historical charge-off and recovery data, and nonperforming loan activity. Also, there are a number of other factors that are taken into consideration, including: the magnitude, nature and trends of recent loan charge-offs and recoveries, the growth in the loan portfolio and the implication that it has in relation to the economic climate in the Bank's market territories, and the economic environment in the Upstate New York territory primarily (the Company's largest geographical area) over the last several years, as well as in the Company's other market areas. If our assumptions and analysis prove to be incorrect, our ALLL may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance which is maintained through provisions for loan losses. Material additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income.. The regulatory capital rules, when fully phased in, will effectively increase our capital requirements and could slow our growth, cause us to seek to raise additional capital, or both.. As discussed under \"Regulation and Supervision - Regulatory Capital Requirements and Prompt Corrective Action,\" the Company and the Bank became subject to new capital requirements in 2015. The new capital rules impose stringent capital requirements on the Company and the Bank and generally require banking organizations to hold high-quality capital to act as a financial cushion to absorb losses and help banking organizations better withstand periods of financial stress. The final rule increased the required minimum capital ratios for all banking organizations and introduced a \"capital conservation buffer\" that is in addition to each capital ratio. Savings and loan holding companies such as the Company had not previously been subject to capital requirements but have now become subject to the same capital requirements as bank holding companies.. The application of more stringent capital requirements for us could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require us to limit the growth we may otherwise seek, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions such as prohibitions on the payment of dividends, the payment of bonuses to employees or the repurchase of shares if we were unable to comply with such requirements.. If Trustco Bank fails to comply with the new capital standards, the OCC will have the authority to take \"prompt corrective action,\" depending on the Bank's capital level. Currently, the Bank is considered \"well-capitalized\" for prompt corrective action purposes. If it were to be designated by the OCC in one of the lower capital levels - \"undercapitalized,\" \"significantly undercapitalized\" and \"critically undercapitalized\" - the Bank would be required to raise additional capital and also would be subject to progressively more severe restrictions on operations, management, and capital distributions; replacement of senior executive officers and directors; and, if it became \"critically undercapitalized,\" to the appointment of a conservator or receiver.. Although we continue to evaluate the impact the new capital rules will have on us, we currently anticipate that we will continue to be well-capitalized in accordance with the regulatory standards.. A prolonged economic downturn, especially one affecting our geographic market area, will adversely affect our operations and financial results.. Our primary lending emphasis is the origination of one-to-four family first mortgage loans on residential properties; therefore we are particularly exposed to downturns in the U.S. housing market. The primary risks inherent in our one- to four-family loan portfolio are declines in economic conditions, elevated levels of unemployment or underemployment, and declines in residential real estate values. Any one or a combination of these events may have an adverse impact on borrowers' ability to repay their loans, which could result in increased delinquencies, non-performing assets, loan losses, and future loan loss provisions.. 16. Index. Additionally, we have a concentration of loans secured in New York and Florida. Approximately 76.9% of our loan portfolio is comprised of loans secured by property located in our markets in and around of New York, and approximately 23.1% is comprised of loans secured by property located in Florida. This makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the local economy and real estate markets. Adverse conditions in the local economy such as inflation, unemployment, recession, natural disasters, or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. Decreases in local real estate values could adversely affect the value of the property used as collateral for our loans, which could cause us to realize a loss in the event of a foreclosure. Currently, there is not a single employer or industry in the area on which the majority of our customers are dependent.. The Company operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws, regulations and tax policies.. As described above, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, its primary federal regulator, and by the FDIC, as insurer of our deposits. In addition, the Company is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank rather than for holders of the Company's common stock. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations, and policies for possible changes. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on operations, the classification of the Bank's assets, and determination of the level of allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation, or supervisory action, may have a material impact on operations.. The effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on our business have not yet been fully analyzed and could have an adverse effect on our net income.. The Company operates in an environment that imposes income taxes on its operations at both the federal and state levels to varying degrees. Strategies and operating routines have been implemented to minimize the impact of these taxes. Consequently, any change in tax legislation could significantly alter the effectiveness of these strategies. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") was signed into law. We are in the process of analyzing the Tax Act and its possible effects on the Company and Trustco Bank. The Tax Act reduces the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, among other things.. The Tax Act required us to write down the deferred tax asset reported on the Company's balance sheet, which reduced our net income during the final quarter of 2017. We cannot determine at this time the full effects of the Tax Act on our business and financial results. The net deferred tax asset reported on the Company's balance sheet generally represents the tax benefit of future deductions from taxable income for items that have already been recognized for financial reporting purposes. The bulk of these deferred tax assets consists of deferred loan loss deductions, deferred compensation deductions and unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities. The net deferred tax asset is measured by applying currently-enacted income tax rates to the accounting period during which the tax benefit is expected to be realized. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's net deferred tax asset was $7.3 million.. Our ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory limitations and other limitations which may affect our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders or to repurchase our common stock.. TrustCo is a separate legal entity from its subsidiary, Trustco Bank, and does not have significant operations of its own. The availability of dividends from Trustco Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors that the OCC or the Federal Reserve Board could assert that payment of dividends or other payments may result in an unsafe or unsound practice. In addition, TrustCo is subject to consolidated capital requirements and will be required to serve as a source of strength to Trustco Bank. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to TrustCo, or if TrustCo is required to retain capital or contribute capital to the Bank, we may not be able to pay dividends on our common stock or to repurchase shares of common stock.. 17. Index. Changes in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and our income.. We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by the OCC, FRB, and FDIC. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on a bank's operations, reclassify assets, determine the adequacy of a bank's loss allowances, and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading, and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies and will continue to do so.  Any change in banking regulations and oversight, and the regulation of other agencies, such as the CFPB and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, whether in the form of regulatory policy, new regulations or legislation, or additional deposit insurance premiums, could have a material impact on our operations.  New or revised rules may increase our regulatory compliance burden and costs and restrict the financial products and services we offer to our customers.. Further, there may be additional laws and regulations, or changes in policy, affecting lending and funding practices, regulatory capital limits, interest rate risk management, and liquidity standards. The federal bank regulatory agencies may require us to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements, and new laws and regulations may increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business, and otherwise affect our operations. New laws and regulations may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, the products we offer, the fees we can charge and our ongoing operations, costs, and profitability.. The FASB has recently issued an accounting standard update that will result in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses and may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.. In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued an accounting standard update, \"Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\" which replaces the current \"incurred loss\" model for recognizing credit losses with an \"expected loss\" model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (\"CECL\") model. Under the CECL model, we will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \"incurred loss\" model required under current generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, we expect that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how we determine our allowance for loan losses and could require us to significantly increase our allowance. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. The new CECL standard will become effective for us for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact the CECL model will have on our accounting, but we expect to recognize a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to our allowance for loan losses as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective, consistent with regulatory expectations set forth in interagency guidance issued at the end of 2016. We cannot yet determine the magnitude of any such one-time cumulative adjustment or of the overall impact of the new standard on our financial condition or results of operations.. Our business could be adversely affected by third-party service providers, data breaches and cyber-attacks.. We face the risk of operational disruption, failure, or capacity constraints due to our dependency on third-party vendors for components of our business infrastructure. While we have selected these third-party vendors through our vendor management process, we do not control their operations. As such, any failure on the part of these business partners to perform their various responsibilities could also adversely affect our business and operations.. 18. Index. Our assets that are at risk for cyber-attacks include financial assets and non-public information belonging to customers. We use several third-party vendors who have access to our assets via electronic media. Certain cyber security risks arise due to this access, including cyber espionage, blackmail, ransom, and theft. We employ many preventive and detective controls to protect our assets and provide recurring information security training to all employees. To date, we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks or attempted breaches, or incur resulting losses, in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, our plans to continue to implement Internet and mobile banking to meet customer demand, and the current economic and political environment. As cyber and other data security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.. A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could disrupt our businesses, and adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm.. The potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization and, as a result of our interactions with, and reliance on, third parties, is not limited to our own internal operational functions. Our operational and security systems, infrastructure, including our computer systems, data management, and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance. We rely on our employees and third parties in our day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error, misconduct, malfeasance or failure, or breach of third-party systems or infrastructure, expose us to risk. We have taken measures to implement backup systems and other safeguards to support our operations, but our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact and rely. For example, strategic technology project implementation challenges may cause business interruptions. In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could adversely affect our ability to process these transactions or provide these services. There could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods; disease pandemics; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts. We continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with all applicable laws, rules and regulations globally. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including business interruptions. Operational risk exposures could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm.. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information, whether through a breach of our computer systems or otherwise, could severely harm our business.. As part of our financial institution business, we collect, process, and retain sensitive and confidential customer information. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. If information security is breached, information can be lost or misappropriated, resulting in financial loss or costs to us. Any security breach involving confidential customer information, whether by us or by our vendors, could severely damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of litigation and liability or disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business.. We could suffer a material adverse impact from interruptions in the effective operation of, or security breaches affecting, our computer systems.. We rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business and to process, record, and monitor our transactions. Risks to the systems result from a variety of factors, including the potential for bad acts on the part of hackers, criminals, employees and others. As one example, in recent years, some banks have experienced denial of service attacks in which individuals or organizations flood the bank's website with extraordinarily high volumes of traffic, with the goal and effect of disrupting the ability of the bank to process transactions. We are also at risk for the impact of natural disasters, terrorism, and international hostilities on our systems or for the effects of outages or other failures involving power or communications systems operated by others. These risks also arise from the same types of threats to businesses with which we deal.. 19. Index. Potential adverse consequences of attacks on our computer systems or other threats include damage to our reputation, loss of customer business, litigation, and increased regulatory scrutiny, which might also result in financial loss and require additional efforts and expense to attempt to prevent such adverse consequences in the future.      Consumers and businesses are increasingly using non-banks to complete their financial transactions, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations      Technology and other changes are allowing consumers and businesses to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods. For example, the wide acceptance of Internet-based commerce has resulted in a number of alternative payment processing systems and lending platforms in which banks play only minor roles. Customers can now maintain funds in prepaid debit cards or digital currencies, and pay bills and transfer funds directly without the direct assistance of banks. The diminishing role of banks as financial intermediaries has resulted and could continue to result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the potential loss of lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.      Market volatility levels have experienced significant variations in recent years and a return to very high volatility levels could adversely affect us.      The stock and credit markets have been experiencing significant variations in volatility levels in recent years. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers' underlying financial strength. Current volatility levels have diminished significantly from the peak, but a return to higher levels could cause the Company to experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.      The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.      Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, banks, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional entities. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. Any such losses could be material and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.      We are subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility and lender liability.      Some of the services we provide, such as trust and investment services, require us to act as fiduciaries for our customers and others. In addition, loan workout and other activities may expose us or Trustco Bank to legal actions, including lender liability or environmental claims. From time to time, third parties make claims and take legal action against us pertaining to the performance of our fiduciary responsibilities or loan-related activities. If these claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, we may be exposed to significant financial liability and/or our reputation could be damaged. Either of these results may adversely impact demand for our products and services or otherwise have a harmful effect on our business and, in turn, on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.       20       Index       We may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors or borrowers or meet our operating cash needs to fund corporate expansion and other activities.      Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The liquidity of Trustco Bank is used to make loans and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and limits have been established by our board of directors, and our management monitors the overall liquidity position of Trustco Bank to ensure that various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. Trustco Bank is also a member of the Federal Reserve System and Federal Home Loan Bank System, each of which provides funding to members through advances and other extensions of credit that are typically collateralized with securities or mortgage-related assets. Our securities portfolio can be used as a secondary source of liquidity, and additional liquidity could be obtained from securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and debt or equity securities issuances in public or private transactions. If we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, we might not be able to meet the needs of our customers, which could adversely affect our financial condition, our results of operations, cash flows and our level of regulatory capital.      New lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.      From time to time, we may develop and grow new lines of business or offer new products and services within our existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. All service offerings, including current offerings and those which may be provided in the future, may become more risky due to changes in economic, competitive and market conditions beyond our control.      We may be subject to a higher effective tax rate if Trustco Realty Corp. (\"Trustco Realty\") fails to qualify as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\").      Trustco Realty, a subsidiary of Trustco Bank, operates as a REIT for tax purposes. Trustco Realty was established to acquire, hold and manage mortgage assets and other authorized investments to generate net income for distribution to its shareholders.      For an entity to qualify as a REIT, it must meet certain organizational tests and it must satisfy the following six asset tests under the Internal Revenue Code each quarter: (1) at least 75% of the value of the REIT's total assets must consist of real estate assets, cash and cash items, and government securities; (2) not more than 25% of the value of the REIT's total assets may consist of securities, other than those includible under the 75% test; (3) not more than 5% of the value of its total assets may consist of securities of any one issuer, other than those securities includible under the 75% test or securities of a taxable REIT subsidiary; (4) not more than 10% of the outstanding voting power of any one issuer may be held, other than those securities includible under the 75% test or securities of a taxable REIT subsidiary; (5) not more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer may be held, other than those securities includible under the 75% test or securities of a taxable REIT subsidiary; and (6) a REIT cannot own securities in one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries which comprise more than 25% of the value of its total assets. At December 31, 2017, Trustco Realty met all six quarterly asset tests.      Also, a REIT must satisfy the following two gross income tests each year: (1) at least 75% of its gross income must be from qualifying income closely connected with real estate activities; and (2) 95% of its gross income must be derived from sources qualifying for the 75% test and dividends, interest, and gains from the sale of securities. In addition, a REIT must distribute at least 90% of its taxable income for the taxable year, excluding any net capital gains, to maintain its non-taxable status for federal income tax purposes. For 2017, Trustco Realty had met the two annual income tests and the distribution test.       21       Index       If Trustco Realty fails to meet any of the required provisions and, therefore, does not qualify to be a REIT, our effective tax rate would increase.      The trust wealth management fees we receive may decrease as a result of poor investment performance, in either relative or absolute terms, which could decrease our revenues and net earnings.      Our Trustco Financial Services department derives its revenues primarily from investment management fees based on assets under management. Our ability to maintain or increase assets under management is subject to a number of factors, including investors' perception of our past performance, in either relative or absolute terms, market and economic conditions, and competition from investment management companies. Financial markets are affected by many factors, all of which are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, securities market conditions, the level and volatility of interest rates and equity prices, competitive conditions, monetary and fiscal policy and investor sentiment. A decline in the value of the assets under management would decrease our income. Further certain of our investment advisory and wealth management clients can terminate, with little or no notice, their relationships with us, reduce their aggregate assets under management, or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures.      Strong competition within the Bank's market areas could hurt profits and slow growth.      The Bank faces intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. This competition comes principally from other banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, other lenders, and institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives. Many of our competitors have competitive advantages, including greater financial resources and higher lending limits, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, more aggressive marketing campaigns and better brand recognition, and the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives, as well as lower origination and operating costs. Competition has made it more difficult for the Bank to make new loans and at times has forced the Bank to offer higher deposit rates. Price competition for loans and deposits might result in the Bank earning less on loans and paying more on deposits, which would reduce net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult to grow loans and deposits and to hire and retain experienced employees. Management expects competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. The Bank's profitability depends upon its continued ability to compete successfully in its market areas.      We are dependent upon the services of our management team.      We are dependent upon the ability and experience of a number of our key management personnel who have substantial experience with our operations, the financial services industry and the markets in which we offer our services. It is possible that the loss of the services of one or more of our senior executives or key managers would have an adverse effect on our operations. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, manage and retain other qualified middle management personnel as we grow. We cannot assure you that we will continue to attract or retain such personnel.      Provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and New York law may discourage or prevent takeover attempts, and these provisions may have the effect of reducing the market price of our stock.      Our articles of incorporation and bylaws include several provisions that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing hostile takeover attempts, and therefore, making the removal of incumbent management difficult. The provisions include staggered terms for our board of directors and requirements of supermajority votes to approve certain business transactions. In addition, New York law contains several provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of the board of directors, and may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding stock. To the extent that these provisions are effective in discouraging or preventing takeover attempts, they may tend to reduce the market price for our stock.      Changes in accounting standards could impact reported earnings.       22       Index       The accounting standard setting bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory bodies, periodically change financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised accounting standard retroactively, which could affect beginning of period financial statement amounts.      Our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.      Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by TrustCo in reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.      These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.      The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results.      Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. One of our most critical estimates is the level of the allowance for loan losses. Due to the inherent nature of this estimate, we cannot provide absolute assurance that we will not significantly increase the allowance for loan losses higher than the current balance.      We rely on communications, information, operating and financial control systems, and technology from third-party service providers, and we may suffer an interruption in those systems that may result in lost business. Further, we may not be able to substitute providers on terms that are as favorable if our relationships with our existing service providers are interrupted.      We rely heavily on third-party service providers for much of our communications, information, operating and financial controls systems, and technology. Any failure or interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or interruptions in our customer relationships management, general ledger, deposit, servicing and/or loan origination systems. We cannot assure you that such failures or interruptions will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed by us or the third parties on which we rely. The occurrence of any failure or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If any of our third-party service providers experience financial, operational or technological difficulties, or if there is any other disruption in our relationships with them, we may be required to locate alternative sources of such services, and we cannot assure you that we could negotiate terms that are as favorable to us, or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in our existing systems, without the need to expend substantial resources, if at all. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.      If the business continuity and disaster recovery plans that we have in place are not adequate to continue our operations in the event of a disaster, the business disruption can adversely impact our operations.      External events, including terrorist or military actions, or an outbreak of disease, and resulting political and social turmoil could cause unforeseen damage to our physical facilities or could cause delays or disruptions to operational functions, including information processing and financial market settlement functions. Additionally, our customers, vendors and counterparties could suffer from such events. Should these events affect us, or our customers, or vendors or counterparties with which we conduct business, our results of operations could be adversely affected.       23       Index       The Company's risk-management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.      The Company maintains an enterprise risk management program that is designed to identify, quantify, monitor, report, and control the risks that it faces. These risks include: interest-rate, credit, liquidity, operations, reputation, compliance and litigation. While the Company assesses and improves this program on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that its approach and framework for risk management and related controls will effectively mitigate all risk and limit losses in its business. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in the Company's risk-management program, or if its controls break down, the performance and value of its business could be adversely affected.       Item 1B  Unresolved Staff Comments         None.        Item 2.  Properties         TrustCo's executive offices are located at 5 Sarnowski Drive, Glenville, New York, 12302. The Company operates 145 banking offices, of which 24 are owned and 121 are leased from others. The asset value of these properties, when considered in the aggregate, is not material to the operation of TrustCo.      In the opinion of management, the physical properties of TrustCo and the Bank are suitable and adequate and are being fully utilized.       Item 3.  Legal Proceedings         The nature of TrustCo's business generates a certain amount of litigation against TrustCo and its subsidiaries involving matters arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management of TrustCo, there are no proceedings pending to which TrustCo or any of its subsidiaries is a party, or of which its property is the subject which, if determined adversely to TrustCo or such subsidiaries, would be material in relation to TrustCo's consolidated shareholders' equity and financial condition.
