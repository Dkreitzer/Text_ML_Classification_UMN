[1] "Item 1A.             Risk     Factors. This section describes circumstances or events that could have a     negative effect on our financial results or operations or that     could change, for the worse, existing trends in some or all of     our businesses. The occurrence of one or more of the     circumstances or events described below could have a material     adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations     and cash flows or on the trading prices of the Common Stock and     convertible notes that we have issued or securities we may issue     in the future. The risks and uncertainties described in this     Annual Report are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks     and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we     currently believe are immaterial may also adversely affect our     business and operations.. Risks     Related to Our WebMD Operations and the Healthcare Content We     Provide. If we     are unable to provide content and services that attract and     retain users to The WebMD Health Network on a consistent basis,     our advertising and sponsorship revenue could be     reduced. Users of The WebMD Health Network have numerous other     online and offline sources of healthcare information services.     Our ability to compete for user traffic on our public portals     depends upon our ability to make available a variety of health     and medical content, decision-support applications and other     services that meet the needs of a variety of types of users,     including consumers, physicians and other healthcare     professionals, with a variety of reasons for seeking     information. Our ability to do so depends, in turn, on:. <U+0095>            our ability to hire and retain qualified authors, journalists     and independent writers;             <U+0095>            our ability to license quality content from third     parties; and             <U+0095>            our ability to monitor and respond to increases and decreases in     user interest in specific topics.. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to develop     or acquire needed content, applications and tools at a     reasonable cost. In addition, since consumer users of our public     portals may be attracted to The WebMD Health Network as a     result of a specific condition or for a specific purpose, it is     difficult for us to predict the rate at which they will return     to the public portals. Because we generate revenue by, among     other things, selling sponsorships of specific pages, sections     or events on The WebMD Health Network, a decline in user     traffic levels or a reduction in the number of pages viewed by     users could cause our revenue to decrease and could have a     material adverse effect on our results of operations.. Developing     and implementing new and updated applications, features and     services for our public and private portals may be more     difficult than expected, may take longer and cost more than     expected and may not result in sufficient increases in revenue     to justify the costs. Attracting and retaining users of our public portals and clients     for our private portals requires us to continue to improve the     technology underlying those portals and to continue to develop     new and updated applications, features and services for those     portals. If we are unable to do so on a timely basis or if we     are unable to implement new applications, features and services     without disruption to our existing ones, we may lose potential     users and clients.. We rely on a combination of internal development, strategic     relationships, licensing and acquisitions to develop our portals     and related applications, features and services. Our development     and/or     implementation of new technologies, applications, features and     services may cost more than expected, may take longer than     originally expected, may require more testing than originally     anticipated and may require the acquisition of additional     personnel and other resources. There can be no assurance that     the revenue opportunities from any new or updated technologies,     applications, features or services will justify the amounts     spent.. 35. Table of Contents. We     face significant competition for our healthcare information     products and services. The markets for healthcare information products and services are     intensely competitive, continually evolving and, in some cases,     subject to rapid change.. <U+0095>            Our public portals face competition from numerous other     companies, both in attracting users and in generating revenue     from advertisers and sponsors. We compete for users with online     services and Web sites that provide health-related information,     including both commercial sites and not-for-profit sites. We     compete for advertisers and sponsors with: health-related Web     sites; general purpose consumer Web sites that offer specialized     health sub-channels; other high-traffic Web sites that include     both healthcare-related and non-healthcare-related content and     services; search engines that provide specialized health search;     and advertising networks that aggregate traffic from multiple     sites. Our public portals also face competition from offline     publications and information services.             <U+0095>            Our private portals compete with: providers of healthcare     decision-support tools and online health management     applications, including personal health records; wellness and     disease management vendors; and health information services and     health management offerings of healthcare benefits companies and     their affiliates.             <U+0095>            Our Publishing and Other Services segment's products and     services compete with numerous other offline publications, some     of which have better access to traditional distribution channels     than we have, and also compete with online information sources.. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical,     product development, marketing and other resources than we do.     These organizations may be better known than we are and have     more customers or users than we do. We cannot provide assurance     that we will be able to compete successfully against these     organizations or any alliances they have formed or may form.     Since there are no substantial barriers to entry into the     markets in which our public portals participate, we expect that     competitors will continue to enter these markets.. Failure     to maintain and enhance the \"WebMD\" brand could have a     material adverse effect on our business. We believe that the \"WebMD\" brand identity that we     have developed has contributed to the success of our business     and has helped us achieve recognition as a trusted source of     health and wellness information. We also believe that     maintaining and enhancing that brand is important to expanding     the user base for our public portals, to our relationships with     sponsors and advertisers and to our ability to gain additional     employer and healthcare payer clients for our private portals.     We have expended considerable resources on establishing and     enhancing the \"WebMD\" brand and our other brands, and     we have developed policies and procedures designed to preserve     and enhance our brands, including editorial procedures designed     to provide quality control of the information we publish. We     expect to continue to devote resources and efforts to maintain     and enhance our brands. However, we may not be able to     successfully maintain or enhance awareness of our brands, and     events outside of our control may have a negative effect on our     brands. If we are unable to maintain or enhance awareness of our     brand, and do so in a cost-effective manner, our business could     be adversely affected.. Our     online businesses have a limited operating history. Our online businesses have a limited operating history and     participate in relatively new markets. These markets, and our     online businesses, have undergone significant changes during     their short history and can be expected to continue to change.     Many companies with business plans based on providing healthcare     information and related services through the Internet have     failed to be profitable and some have filed for bankruptcy     and/or     ceased operations. Even if demand from users exists, we cannot     assure you that our businesses will continue to be profitable.. 36. Table of Contents. Our     failure to attract and retain qualified executives and employees     may have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business depends largely on the skills, experience and     performance of key members of our management team. We also     depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified     writers and editors, software developers and other technical     personnel and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for     qualified personnel in the healthcare information services and     Internet industries is intense. We cannot assure you that we     will be able to hire or retain a sufficient number of qualified     personnel to meet our requirements, or that we will be able to     do so at salary and benefit costs that are acceptable to us.     Failure to do so may have an adverse effect on our business.. If we     are unable to provide healthcare content for our offline     publications that attracts and retains users, our revenue will     be reduced. Interest in our offline publications, such as The WebMD     Little Blue Book, is based upon our ability to make     available up-to-date health content that meets the needs of our     physician users. Although we have been able to continue to     update and maintain the physician practice information that we     publish in The WebMD Little Blue Book, if we are unable     to continue to do so for any reason, the value of The WebMD     Little Blue Book would diminish and interest in this     publication and advertising in this publication would be     adversely affected.. WebMD the Magazine was launched in April 2005 and, as a     result, has a very short operating history. We cannot assure you     that WebMD the Magazine will be able to attract and     retain the advertisers needed to make this publication     successful in the future.. The     timing of our advertising and sponsorship revenue may vary     significantly from quarter to quarter and is subject to factors     beyond our control, including regulatory changes affecting     advertising and promotion of drugs and medical devices and     general economic conditions. Our advertising and sponsorship revenue, which accounted for     approximately 75% of our total Online Services segment revenue     for the year ended December 31, 2008, may vary     significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of     factors, many of which are not in our control, and some of which     may be difficult to forecast accurately, including potential     effects on demand for our services as a result of regulatory     changes affecting advertising and promotion of drugs and medical     devices and general economic conditions. The majority of our     advertising and sponsorship programs are for terms of     approximately four to twelve months. We have relatively few     longer term advertising and sponsorship programs. We cannot     assure you that our current advertisers and sponsors will     continue to use our services beyond the terms of their existing     contracts or that they will enter into any additional contracts.. The time between the date of initial contact with a potential     advertiser or sponsor regarding a specific program and the     execution of a contract with the advertiser or sponsor for that     program may be lengthy, especially for larger contracts, and may     be subject to delays over which we have little or no control,     including as a result of budgetary constraints of the advertiser     or sponsor or their need for internal approvals. Other factors     that could affect the timing of contracting for specific     programs with advertisers and sponsors, or receipt of revenue     under such contracts, include:. <U+0095>            the timing of FDA approval for new products or for new approved     uses for existing products;             <U+0095>            the timing of FDA approval of generic products that compete with     existing brand name products;             <U+0095>            the timing of withdrawals of products from the market;             <U+0095>            seasonal factors relating to the prevalence of specific health     conditions and other seasonal factors that may affect the timing     of promotional campaigns for specific products; and             <U+0095>            the scheduling of conferences for physicians and other     healthcare professionals.. 37. Table of Contents. We may     be unsuccessful in our efforts to increase advertising and     sponsorship revenue from consumer products     companies. Most of our advertising and sponsorship revenue has, in the     past, come from pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device     companies. We have been focusing on increasing sponsorship     revenue from consumer products companies that are interested in     communicating health-related or safety-related information about     their products to our audience. However, while a number of     consumer products companies have indicated an intent to increase     the portion of their promotional spending used on the Internet,     we cannot assure you that these advertisers and sponsors will     find our consumer Web sites to be as effective as other Web     sites or traditional media for promoting their products and     services. If we encounter difficulties in competing with the     other alternatives available to consumer products companies,     this portion of our business may develop more slowly than we     expect or may fail to develop. In addition, revenues from     consumer products companies are more likely to reflect general     economic conditions, and to be reduced to a greater extent     during economic downturns or recessions, than revenues from     pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies.. Lengthy     sales and implementation cycles for our private online portals     make it difficult to forecast our revenues from these     applications and may have an adverse impact on our     business. The period from our initial contact with a potential client for     a private online portal and the first purchase of our solution     by the client is difficult to predict. In the past, this period     has generally ranged from six to twelve months, but in some     cases has been longer. Potential sales may be subject to delays     or cancellations due to a client's internal procedures for     approving large expenditures and other factors beyond our     control, including the effect of general economic conditions on     the willingness of potential clients to commit to licensing our     private portals. The time it takes to implement a private online     portal is also difficult to predict and has lasted as long as     six months from contract execution to the commencement of live     operation. Implementation may be subject to delays based on the     availability of the internal resources of the client that are     needed and other factors outside of our control. As a result, we     have limited ability to forecast the timing of revenue from new     clients. This, in turn, makes it more difficult to predict our     financial performance from quarter to quarter.. During the sales cycle and the implementation period, we may     expend substantial time, effort and money preparing contract     proposals, negotiating contracts and implementing the private     online portal without receiving any related revenue. In     addition, many of the expenses related to providing private     online portals are relatively fixed in the short term, including     personnel costs and technology and infrastructure costs. Even if     our private portal revenue is lower than expected, we may not be     able to reduce related short-term spending in response. Any     shortfall in such revenue would have a direct impact on our     results of operations.. Our     ability to provide comparative information on hospital cost and     quality depends on our ability to obtain the required data on a     timely basis and, if we are unable to do so, our private portal     services would be less attractive to clients. We provide, in connection with our private portal services,     comparative information about hospital cost and quality. Our     ability to provide this information depends on our ability to     obtain comprehensive, reliable data. We currently obtain this     data from a number of public and private sources, including the     Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), 24 individual     states and the Leapfrog Group. We cannot provide assurance that     we would be able to find alternative sources for this data on     acceptable terms and conditions. Accordingly, our business could     be negatively impacted if CMS or our other data sources cease to     make such information available or impose terms and conditions     for making it available that are not consistent with our planned     usage. In addition, the quality of the comparative information     services we provide depends on the reliability of the     information that we are able to obtain. If the information we     use to provide these services contains errors or is otherwise     unreliable, we could lose clients and our reputation could be     damaged.. 38. Table of Contents. Our     ability to renew existing licenses with employers and health     plans will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to     increase usage of our private portal services by their employees     and plan members. In a healthcare market where a greater share of the     responsibility for healthcare costs and decision-making has been     increasingly shifting to consumers, use of information     technology (including personal health records) to assist     consumers in making informed decisions about healthcare has also     increased. We believe that through our WebMD Health and Benefits     Manager tools, including our personal health record application,     we are well positioned to play a role in this consumer-directed     healthcare environment, and these services will be a significant     driver for the growth of our private portals during the next     several years. However, our growth strategy depends, in part, on     increasing usage of our private portal services by our employer     and health plan clients' employees and members,     respectively. Increasing usage of our services requires us to     continue to deliver and improve the underlying technology and     develop new and updated applications, features and services. In     addition, we face competition in the area of healthcare     decision-support tools and online health management applications     and health information services. Many of our competitors have     greater financial, technical, product development, marketing and     other resources than we do, and may be better known than we are.     We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to meet our     development and implementation goals, nor that we will be able     to compete successfully against other vendors offering     competitive services and, as a result, may experience static or     diminished usage for our private portal services and possible     non-renewals of our license agreements.. We may     be subject to claims brought against us as a result of content     we provide. Consumers access health-related information through our online     services, including information regarding particular medical     conditions and possible adverse reactions or side effects from     medications. If our content, or content we obtain from third     parties, contains inaccuracies, it is possible that consumers,     employees, health plan members or others may sue us for various     causes of action. Although our Web sites contain terms and     conditions, including disclaimers of liability, that are     intended to reduce or eliminate our liability, the law governing     the validity and enforceability of online agreements and other     electronic transactions is evolving. We could be subject to     claims by third parties that our online agreements with     consumers and physicians that provide the terms and conditions     for use of our public or private portals are unenforceable. A     finding by a court that these agreements are invalid and that we     are subject to liability could harm our business and require     costly changes to our business.. We have editorial procedures in place to provide quality control     of the information that we publish or provide. However, we     cannot assure you that our editorial and other quality control     procedures will be sufficient to ensure that there are no errors     or omissions in particular content. Even if potential claims do     not result in liability to us, investigating and defending     against these claims could be expensive and time consuming and     could divert management's attention away from our     operations. In addition, our business is based on establishing     the reputation of our portals as trustworthy and dependable     sources of healthcare information. Allegations of impropriety or     inaccuracy, even if unfounded, could harm our reputation and     business.. Expansion     to markets outside the United States will subject us to     additional risks. One element of our growth strategy is to seek to expand our     online services to markets outside the United States. Generally,     we expect that we would accomplish this through partnerships or     joint ventures with other companies having expertise in the     specific country or region. However, our participation in     international markets will still be subject to certain risks     beyond those applicable to our operations in the United States,     such as:. <U+0095>            difficulties in staffing and managing operations outside of the     United States;             <U+0095>            fluctuations in currency exchange rates;             <U+0095>            burdens of complying with a wide variety of legal, regulatory     and market requirements;. 39. Table of Contents. <U+0095>            variability of economic and political conditions, including the     extent of the impact of recent adverse economic conditions in     markets outside the United States;             <U+0095>            tariffs or other trade barriers;             <U+0095>            costs of providing and marketing products and services in     different markets;             <U+0095>            potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on     repatriation of earnings; and             <U+0095>            difficulties in protecting intellectual property.. Risks     Related to the Internet and Our Technological     Infrastructure. Any     service interruption or failure in the systems that we use to     provide online services could harm our business. Our online services are designed to operate 24 hours a day,     seven days a week, without interruption. However, we have     experienced and expect that we will in the future experience     interruptions and delays in services and availability from time     to time. We rely on internal systems as well as third-party     vendors, including data center providers and bandwidth     providers, to provide our online services. We may not maintain     redundant systems or facilities for some of these services. In     the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of     these systems or facilities, we may experience an extended     period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact     our relationship with users. In addition, system failures may     result in loss of data, including user registration data,     content, and other data critical to the operation of our online     services, which could cause significant harm to our business and     our reputation.. To operate without interruption or loss of data, both we and our     service providers must guard against:. <U+0095>            damage from fire, power loss and other natural disasters;             <U+0095>            communications failures;             <U+0095>            software and hardware errors, failures and crashes;             <U+0095>            security breaches, computer viruses and similar disruptive     problems; and             <U+0095>            other potential service interruptions.. Any disruption in the network access or co-location services     provided by third-party providers to us or any failure by these     third-party providers or our own systems to handle current or     higher volume of use could significantly harm our business. We     exercise little control over these third-party vendors, which     increases our vulnerability to problems with services they     provide.. Any errors, failures, interruptions or delays experienced in     connection with these third-party technologies and information     services or our own systems could negatively impact our     relationships with users and adversely affect our brand and our     business and could expose us to liabilities to third parties.     Although we maintain insurance for our business, the coverage     under our policies may not be adequate to compensate us for all     losses that may occur. In addition, we cannot provide assurance     that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance     coverage at an acceptable cost.. Implementation     of additions to or changes in hardware and software platforms     used to deliver our online services may result in performance     problems and may not provide the additional functionality that     was expected. From time to time, we implement additions to or changes in the     hardware and software platforms we use for providing our online     services. During and after the implementation of additions or     changes, a platform may not perform as expected, which could     result in interruptions in operations, an increase in response     time or an inability to track performance metrics. In addition,     in connection with integrating acquired businesses, we may move     their operations to our hardware and software platforms or make     other changes, any of which could. 40. Table of Contents. result in interruptions in those operations. Any significant     interruption in our ability to operate any of our online     services could have an adverse effect on our relationships with     users and clients and, as a result, on our financial results. We     rely on a combination of purchasing, licensing, internal     development, and acquisitions to develop our hardware and     software platforms. Our implementation of additions to or     changes in these platforms may cost more than originally     expected, may take longer than originally expected, and may     require more testing than originally anticipated. In addition,     we cannot provide assurance that additions to or changes in     these platforms will provide the additional functionality and     other benefits that were originally expected.. If the     systems we use to provide online portals experience security     breaches or are otherwise perceived to be insecure, our business     could suffer. We retain and transmit confidential information, including     personal health records, in the processing centers and other     facilities we use to provide online services. It is critical     that these facilities and infrastructure remain secure and be     perceived by the marketplace as secure. A security breach could     damage our reputation or result in liability. We may be required     to expend significant capital and other resources to protect     against security breaches and hackers or to alleviate problems     caused by breaches. Despite the implementation of security     measures, this infrastructure or other systems that we interface     with, including the Internet and related systems, may be     vulnerable to physical break-ins, hackers, improper employee or     contractor access, computer viruses, programming errors,     denial-of-service attacks or other attacks by third parties or     similar disruptive problems. Any compromise of our security,     whether as a result of our own systems or the systems that they     interface with, could reduce demand for our services and could     subject us to legal claims from our clients and users, including     for breach of contract or breach of warranty.. Our     online services are dependent on the development and maintenance     of the Internet infrastructure. Our ability to deliver our online services is dependent on the     development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the     Internet by third parties. The Internet has experienced a     variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to     portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and     delays in the future. The Internet has also experienced, and is     likely to continue to experience, significant growth in the     number of users and the amount of traffic. If the Internet     continues to experience increased usage, the Internet     infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on     it. In addition, the reliability and performance of the Internet     may be harmed by increased usage or by denial-of-service     attacks. Any resulting interruptions in our services or     increases in response time could, if significant, result in a     loss of potential or existing users of and advertisers and     sponsors on our Web sites and, if sustained or repeated, could     reduce the attractiveness of our services.. Customers who utilize our online services depend on Internet     service providers and other Web site operators for access to our     Web sites. All of these providers have experienced significant     outages in the past and could experience outages, delays and     other difficulties in the future due to system failures     unrelated to our systems. Any such outages or other failures on     their part could reduce traffic to our Web sites.. Third     parties may challenge the enforceability of our online     agreements. The law governing the validity and enforceability of online     agreements and other electronic transactions is evolving. We     could be subject to claims by third parties that the online     terms and conditions for use of our Web sites, including     disclaimers or limitations of liability, are unenforceable. A     finding by a court that these terms and conditions or other     online agreements are invalid could harm our business.. We     could be subject to breach of warranty or other claims by     clients of our online portals if the software and systems we use     to provide them contain errors or experience     failures. Errors in the software and systems we use could cause serious     problems for clients of our online portals. We may fail to meet     contractual performance standards or client expectations.     Clients of our online portals may seek compensation from us or     may seek to terminate their agreements with us, withhold     payments due to us, seek refunds from us of part or all of the     fees charged under those agreements or initiate litigation or     other. 41. Table of Contents. dispute resolution procedures. In addition, we could face breach     of warranty or other claims by clients or additional development     costs. Our software and systems are inherently complex and,     despite testing and quality control, we cannot be certain that     they will perform as planned.. We attempt to limit, by contract, our liability to our clients     for damages arising from our negligence, errors or mistakes.     However, contractual limitations on liability may not be     enforceable in certain circumstances or may otherwise not     provide sufficient protection to us from liability for damages.     We maintain liability insurance coverage, including coverage for     errors and omissions. However, it is possible that claims could     exceed the amount of our applicable insurance coverage, if any,     or that this coverage may not continue to be available on     acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts. Even if these claims     do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending     against them would be expensive and time consuming and could     divert management's attention away from our operations. In     addition, negative publicity caused by these events may delay or     hinder market acceptance of our services, including unrelated     services.. We may     not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and     proprietary rights. Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important     to our businesses. The steps that we take to protect our     intellectual property, proprietary information and trade secrets     may prove to be inadequate and, whether or not adequate, may be     expensive. We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent and     other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures     and non-disclosure contractual provisions to protect our     intellectual property. We cannot assure you that we will be able     to detect potential or actual misappropriation or infringement     of our intellectual property, proprietary information or trade     secrets. Even if we detect misappropriation or infringement by a     third party, we cannot assure you that we will be able to     enforce our rights at a reasonable cost, or at all. In addition,     our rights to intellectual property, proprietary information and     trade secrets may not prevent independent third-party     development and commercialization of competing products or     services.. Third     parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual     property, and we could suffer significant litigation or     licensing expenses or be prevented from providing certain     services, which may harm our business. We could be subject to claims that we are misappropriating or     infringing intellectual property or other proprietary rights of     others. These claims, even if not meritorious, could be     expensive to defend and divert management's attention from     our operations. If we become liable to third parties for     infringing these rights, we could be required to pay a     substantial damage award and to develop non-infringing     technology, obtain a license or cease selling the products or     services that use or contain the infringing intellectual     property. We may be unable to develop non-infringing products or     services or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms,     or at all. We may also be required to indemnify our customers if     they become subject to third-party claims relating to     intellectual property that we license or otherwise provide to     them, which could be costly.. Risks     Related to the Healthcare Industry, Healthcare Regulation and     Internet Regulation. Developments     in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our     business. Most of our revenue is derived from the healthcare industry and     could be affected by changes affecting healthcare spending. We     are particularly dependent on pharmaceutical, biotechnology and     medical device companies for our advertising and sponsorship     revenue. General reductions in expenditures by healthcare     industry participants could result from, among other things:. <U+0095>            government regulation or private initiatives that affect the     manner in which healthcare providers interact with patients,     payers or other healthcare industry participants, including     changes in pricing or means of delivery of healthcare products     and services;             <U+0095>            consolidation of healthcare industry participants;. 42. Table of Contents. <U+0095>            reductions in governmental funding for healthcare; and             <U+0095>            adverse changes in business or economic conditions affecting     healthcare payers or providers, pharmaceutical, biotechnology or     medical device companies or other healthcare industry     participants.. Even if general expenditures by industry participants remain the     same or increase, developments in the healthcare industry may     result in reduced spending in some or all of the specific market     segments that we serve or are planning to serve. For example,     use of our products and services could be affected by:. <U+0095>            changes in the design of health insurance plans;             <U+0095>            a decrease in the number of new drugs or medical devices coming     to market; and             <U+0095>            decreases in marketing expenditures by pharmaceutical or medical     device companies, including as a result of governmental     regulation or private initiatives that discourage or prohibit     advertising or sponsorship activities by pharmaceutical or     medical device companies.. In addition, our customers' expectations regarding pending     or potential industry developments may also affect their     budgeting processes and spending plans with respect to products     and services of the types we provide.. The healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent     years and we expect that significant changes will continue to     occur. However, the timing and impact of developments in the     healthcare industry are difficult to predict. We cannot assure     you that the markets for our products and services will continue     to exist at current levels or that we will have adequate     technical, financial and marketing resources to react to changes     in those markets.. Government     regulation of healthcare creates risks and challenges with     respect to our compliance efforts and our business     strategies. The healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to     changing political, legislative, regulatory and other     influences. Existing and new laws and regulations affecting the     healthcare industry could create unexpected liabilities for us,     could cause us to incur additional costs and could restrict our     operations. Many healthcare laws are complex, and their     application to specific products and services may not be clear.     In particular, many existing healthcare laws and regulations,     when enacted, did not anticipate the healthcare information     services that we provide. However, these laws and regulations     may nonetheless be applied to our products and services. Our     failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws     and regulations, or other failure to comply, could create     liability for us, result in adverse publicity and negatively     affect our businesses. Some of the risks we face from healthcare     regulation are as follows:. <U+0095>            Regulation of Drug and Medical Device Advertising and     Promotion.  The WebMD Health Network provides     services involving advertising and promotion of prescription and     over-the-counter drugs and medical devices. If the Food and Drug     Administration (FDA) or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) finds     that any information on The WebMD Health Network or in     WebMD the Magazine violates FDA or FTC regulations, they     may take regulatory or judicial action against us     and/or the     advertiser or sponsor of that information. State attorneys     general may also take similar action based on their state's     consumer protection statutes. Any increase or change in     regulation of drug or medical device advertising and promotion     could make it more difficult for us to contract for sponsorships     and advertising. Members of Congress, physician groups and     others have criticized the FDA's current policies, and have     called for restrictions on advertising of prescription drugs to     consumers and increased FDA enforcement. We cannot predict what     actions the FDA or industry participants may take in response to     these criticisms. It is also possible that new laws would be     enacted that impose restrictions on such advertising. In     addition, recent private industry initiatives have resulted in     voluntary restrictions, which advertisers and sponsors have     agreed to follow. Our advertising and sponsorship revenue could     be materially reduced by additional restrictions on the     advertising of prescription drugs and medical devices to     consumers, whether imposed by law or regulation or required     under policies adopted by industry members.             <U+0095>            Anti-kickback Laws.  There are federal and     state laws that govern patient referrals, physician financial     relationships and inducements to healthcare providers and     patients. The federal healthcare programs'. 43. Table of Contents. anti-kickback law prohibits any person or entity from offering,     paying, soliciting or receiving anything of value, directly or     indirectly, for the referral of patients covered by Medicare,     Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs or the leasing,     purchasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the lease,     purchase or order of any item, good, facility or service covered     by these programs. Many states also have similar anti-kickback     laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for     which payment is made by a federal healthcare program. These     laws are applicable to manufacturers and distributors and,     therefore, may restrict how we and some of our customers market     products to healthcare providers, including     e-details.     Any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that     any of our practices violate any of these laws could subject us     to civil or criminal penalties and require us to change or     terminate some portions of our business and could have an     adverse effect on our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge     by regulatory authorities of our practices could result in     adverse publicity and be costly for us to respond to.. <U+0095>            Medical Professional Regulation.  The practice     of most healthcare professions requires licensing under     applicable state law. In addition, the laws in some states     prohibit business entities from practicing medicine. If a state     determines that some portion of our business violates these     laws, it may seek to have us discontinue those portions or     subject us to penalties or licensure requirements. Any     determination that we are a healthcare provider and have acted     improperly as a healthcare provider may result in liability to     us.. Government     regulation of the Internet could adversely affect our     business. The Internet and its associated technologies are subject to     government regulation. However, whether and how existing laws     and regulations in various jurisdictions, including privacy and     consumer protection laws, apply to the Internet is still     uncertain. Our failure, or the failure of our business partners     or third-party service providers, to accurately anticipate the     application of these laws and regulations to our products and     services and the manner in which we deliver them, or any other     failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could create     liability for us, result in adverse publicity and negatively     affect our business. In addition, new laws and regulations, or     new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may be     adopted with respect to the Internet and online services,     including in areas such as: user privacy, confidentiality,     consumer protection, pricing, content, copyrights and patents,     and characteristics and quality of products and services. We     cannot predict how these laws or regulations will affect our     business.. Internet user privacy and the use of consumer information to     track online activities are major issues both in the United     States and abroad. For example, in February 2009, the FTC     published Self Regulatory Principles to govern the tracking of     consumers' activities online in order to deliver     advertising targeted to the interests of individual consumers     (sometimes referred to as behavioral advertising). These     principles serve as guidelines to industry. In addition, there     is the possibility of proposed legislation and enforcement     activities relating to behavioral advertising. We have privacy     policies posted on our Web sites that we believe comply with     applicable laws requiring notice to users about our information     collection, use and disclosure practices. We also notify users     about our information collection, use and disclosure practices     relating to data we receive through offline means such as paper     health risk assessments. We cannot assure you that the privacy     policies and other statements we provide to users of our     products and services, or our practices will be found sufficient     to protect us from liability or adverse publicity in this area.     A determination by a state or federal agency or court that any     of our practices do not meet applicable standards, or the     implementation of new standards or requirements, could adversely     affect our business.. We     face potential liability related to the privacy and security of     personal health information we collect from or on behalf of     users of our services. Privacy and security of personal health information,     particularly personal health information stored or transmitted     electronically, is a major issue in the United States. The     Privacy Standards and Security Standards under the Health     Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (or HIPAA)     establish a set of national privacy and security standards for     the protection of individually identifiable health information     by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare     providers (referred to as covered entities) and their business. 44. Table of Contents. associates. Currently, only covered entities are directly     subject to potential civil and criminal liability under these     Standards. However, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act     of 2009 (\"ARRA\") amends the HIPAA Privacy and Security     Standards and makes certain provisions applicable to those     portions of our business, such as those managing employee or     plan member health information for employers or health plans,     that are business associates of covered entities. Currently, we     are bound by certain contracts and agreements to use and     disclose protected health information in a manner consistent     with the Privacy Standards and Security Standards. Beginning on     February 17, 2010, some provisions of the HIPAA Privacy and     Security rules will apply directly to us. Currently, depending     on the facts and circumstances, we could potentially be subject     to criminal liability for aiding and abetting or conspiring with     a covered entity to violate the Privacy Standards or Security     Standards. As of February 17, 2010 we will be directly     subject to HIPAA's criminal and civil penalties. We cannot     assure you that we will adequately address the risks created by     these Standards.. We are unable to predict what changes to these Standards might     be made in the future or how those changes, or other changes in     applicable laws and regulations, could affect our business. Any     new legislation or regulation in the area of privacy of personal     information, including personal health information, could affect     the way we operate our business and could harm our business.. Failure     to maintain CME accreditation could adversely affect Medscape,     LLC's ability to provide online CME offerings. Medscape, LLC's continuing medical education (or CME)     activities are planned and implemented in accordance with the     current Essential Areas and Policies of the Accreditation     Council for Continuing Medical Education, or ACCME, which     oversees providers of CME credit, and other applicable     accreditation standards. ACCME's standards for commercial     support of CME are intended to ensure, among other things, that     CME activities of ACCME-accredited providers, such as Medscape,     LLC, are independent of \"commercial interests,\" which     are defined as entities that produce, market, re-sell or     distribute healthcare goods and services, excluding certain     organizations. \"Commercial interests,\" and entities     owned or controlled by \"commercial interests,\" are     ineligible for accreditation by the ACCME. The standards also     provide that accredited CME providers may not place their CME     content on Web sites owned or controlled by a \"commercial     interest.\" In addition, accredited CME providers may not     ask \"commercial interests\" for speaker or topic     suggestions, and are also prohibited from asking     \"commercial interests\" to review CME content prior to     delivery.. From time to time, ACCME revises its standards for commercial     support of CME. As a result of certain past ACCME revisions, we     adjusted our corporate structure and made changes to our     management and operations intended to allow Medscape, LLC to     provide CME activities that are developed independently from     programs developed by its sister companies, which may not be     independent of \"commercial interests.\" We believe that     these changes allow Medscape, LLC to satisfy the applicable     standards.. In June 2008, the ACCME published for comment several proposals,     including the following:. <U+0095>            Potential New Paradigm for Commercial     Support:  The ACCME stated that due consideration     should be given to eliminating commercial support of CME. To     frame the debate, the ACCME proposed several possible scenarios:     (a) maintaining the current system of commercial support;     (b) completely eliminating commercial support; (c) a     new paradigm that provides for commercial support if the     following conditions are met: (1) educational needs are     identified and verified by organizations that do not receive     commercial support and are free of financial relationships with     industry; (2) the CME addresses a professional practice gap     of a particular group of learners that is corroborated by bona     fide performance measurements of the learners' own     practice; (3) the CME content is from a continuing     education curriculum specified by a bona fide organization or     entity; and (4) the CME is verified as free of commercial     bias; and (d) an alternative new paradigm in which the four     conditions described above would provide a basis for a mechanism     to distribute commercial support derived from industry-donated,     pooled funds.             <U+0095>            Defining Appropriate Interactions between ACCME Accredited     Providers and Commercial Supporters. The ACCME has proposed     that: (a) accredipted providers must not receive     communications from commercial interests announcing or     prescribing any specific content that would be a preferred, or. 45. Table of Contents. sought-after, topic for commercially supported CME (e.g.,     therapeutic area, product-line, patho-physiology); and     (b) receiving communications from commercial interests     regarding a commercial interest's internal criteria for     providing commercial support would also not be permissible.. The comment period for these proposals ended on     September 12, 2008. The comments submitted to the ACCME     indicated significant backing from the medical profession for     commercially-supported CME and, accordingly, we believe that it     is unlikely that a proposal for complete elimination of such     support would be adopted. However, we cannot predict the     ultimate outcome of the process, including what other     alternatives may be considered by ACCME as a result of comments     it has received. The elimination of, or restrictions on,     commercial support for CME could adversely affect the volume of     sponsored online CME programs implemented through our Web sites.. Medscape, LLC's current ACCME accreditation expires at the     end of July 2010. In order for Medscape, LLC to renew its     accreditation, it will be required to demonstrate to the ACCME     that it continues to meet ACCME requirements. If Medscape, LLC     fails to maintain its status as an accredited ACCME provider     (whether at the time of such renewal or at an earlier time as a     result of a failure to comply with existing or additional ACCME     standards), it would not be permitted to accredit CME activities     for physicians and other healthcare professionals. Instead,     Medscape, LLC would be required to use third parties to provide     such CME-related services. That, in turn, could discourage     potential supporters from engaging Medscape, LLC to develop CME     or education-related activities, which could have a material     adverse effect on our business.. Government     regulation and industry initiatives could adversely affect the     volume of sponsored online CME programs implemented through our     Web sites or require changes to how Medscape, LLC offers     CME. CME activities may be subject to government oversight or     regulation by Congress, the FDA, the Department of Health and     Human Services, the federal agency responsible for interpreting     certain federal laws relating to healthcare, and by state     regulatory agencies. Medscape, LLC     and/or the     sponsors of the CME activities that Medscape, LLC accredits may     be subject to enforcement actions if any of these CME activities     are deemed improperly promotional, potentially leading to the     termination of sponsorships.. During the past several years, educational activities, including     CME, directed at physicians have been subject to increased     governmental scrutiny to ensure that sponsors do not influence     or control the content of the activities. For example, the     U.S. Senate Finance Committee conducted an investigation of     the sponsorship of CME activities, including an examination of     the ACCME's role in ensuring that CME activities are     independent from the influence of their supporters. In response,     pharmaceutical companies and medical device companies have     developed and implemented internal controls and procedures that     promote adherence to applicable regulations and requirements. In     implementing these controls and procedures, supporters of CME     may interpret the regulations and requirements differently and     may implement varying procedures or requirements. These controls     and procedures:. <U+0095>            may discourage pharmaceutical companies from providing grants     for independent educational activities;             <U+0095>            may slow their internal approval for such grants;             <U+0095>            may reduce the volume of sponsored educational programs that     Medscape, LLC produces to levels that are lower than in the     past, thereby reducing revenue; and             <U+0095>            may require Medscape, LLC to make changes to how it offers or     provides educational programs, including CME.. In addition, future changes to laws, regulations or     accreditation standards, or to the internal compliance programs     of supporters or potential supporters, may further discourage,     significantly limit, or prohibit supporters or potential     supporters from engaging in educational activities with     Medscape, LLC, or may require Medscape, LLC to make further     changes in the way it offers or provides educational activities.. 46. Table of Contents. Risks     Related to Porex. Porex's     success depends upon demand for its products, which in some     cases ultimately depends upon end-user demand for the products     of Porex's customers. Demand for Porex's products may change materially as a     result of economic or market conditions and other trends that     affect the industries in which Porex participates. In addition,     because a significant portion of Porex's products are     components that are eventually integrated into or used with     products manufactured by customers for resale to end-users, the     demand for these product components is dependent on product     development cycles and marketing efforts of these other     manufacturers, as well as variations in their inventory levels,     which are factors that we are unable to control. Accordingly,     the amount of Porex's sales to manufacturer customers can     be difficult to predict and subject to wide quarter-to-quarter     variances. Porex's sales to manufacturer customers that     sell products used by consumers have been adversely affected by     economic conditions during recent months. We cannot predict how     long that adverse effect will continue and it could, depending     on future economic conditions, become worse in future periods.. Porex     faces significant competition for its products. Porex operates in highly competitive markets. The competitors     for Porex's porous plastic products include other producers     of porous plastic materials as well as companies that     manufacture and sell products made from materials other than     porous plastics that can be used for the same purposes as     Porex's products. For example, Porex's porous plastic     pen nibs compete with felt and fiber tips manufactured by a     variety of suppliers worldwide. Other Porex porous plastic     products compete, depending on the application, with membrane     material, porous metals, metal screens, fiberglass tubes,     pleated paper, resin-impregnated felt, ceramics and other     substances and devices. Porex also competes with in-house design     and manufacturing capabilities of its OEM customers. Some of     Porex's competitors may have greater financial, technical,     product development, marketing and other resources than Porex     does. We cannot provide assurance that Porex will be able to     compete successfully against these companies or against     particular products they provide or may provide in the future.. Porex's     product offerings must meet changing customer     requirements. Porex's products are, in general, used in applications that     are affected by technological change. To satisfy its customers,     Porex must develop and introduce, in a timely manner, products     that meet changing customer requirements at competitive prices.     To do this, Porex must:. <U+0095>            develop new uses of existing porous plastics technologies and     applications;             <U+0095>            innovate and develop new porous plastics technologies and     applications;             <U+0095>            commercialize those technologies and applications;             <U+0095>            manufacture at a cost that allows it to price its products     competitively;             <U+0095>            manufacture and deliver its products in sufficient volumes and     on time;             <U+0095>            accurately anticipate customer needs; and             <U+0095>            differentiate its offerings from those of its competitors.. We cannot assure you that Porex will be able to develop new or     enhanced products or that, if it does, those products will     achieve market acceptance. If Porex does not introduce new     products in a timely manner and make enhancements to existing     products to meet the changing needs of its customers, some of     its products could become obsolete over time, in which case     Porex's customer relationships, revenue and operating     results would be negatively impacted.. 47. Table of Contents. Potential     new or enhanced Porex products may not achieve sufficient sales     to be profitable or justify the cost of their     development. We cannot be certain, when we engage in Porex research and     development activities, whether potential new products or     product enhancements will be accepted by the customers for whom     they are intended. Achieving market acceptance for new or     enhanced products may require substantial marketing efforts and     expenditure of significant funds to create awareness and demand     by potential customers. In addition, sales and marketing efforts     with respect to these products may require the use of additional     resources for training our existing Porex sales forces and for     hiring and training additional salespersons. There can be no     assurance that the revenue opportunities from new or enhanced     products will justify amounts spent for their development and     marketing. In addition, there can be no assurance that any     pricing strategy that we implement for any new or enhanced Porex     products will be economically viable or acceptable to the target     markets.. Porex     may not be able to source the raw materials it needs or may have     to pay more for those raw materials. Some of Porex's products require high-grade plastic resins     with specific properties as raw materials. While Porex has not     experienced any material difficulty in obtaining adequate     supplies of high-grade plastic resins that meet its     requirements, it relies on a limited number of sources for some     of these plastic resins. If Porex experiences a reduction or     interruption in supply from these sources, it may not be able to     access alternative sources of supply within a reasonable period     of time or at commercially reasonable rates, which could have a     material adverse effect on its business and financial results.. In addition, the prices of some of the raw materials that Porex     uses depend, to a great extent, on the price of petroleum. As a     result, increases in the price of petroleum could have an     adverse effect on Porex's margins and on the ability of     Porex's porous plastics products to compete with products     made from other raw materials.. Disruptions     in Porex's manufacturing operations could have a material     adverse effect on its business and financial     results. Any significant disruption in Porex's manufacturing     operations, including as a result of fire, power interruptions,     equipment malfunctions, labor disputes, material shortages,     earthquakes, floods, computer viruses, sabotage, terrorist acts     or other force majeure, could have a material adverse effect on     Porex's ability to deliver products to customers and,     accordingly, its financial results.. Porex     may not be able to keep third parties from using technology it     has developed. Porex uses proprietary technology for manufacturing its porous     plastics products and its success is dependent, to a significant     extent, on its ability to protect the proprietary and     confidential aspects of its technology. Although Porex owns     certain patents, it relies primarily on non-patented proprietary     manufacturing processes. To protect its proprietary processes,     Porex relies on a combination of trade secret laws, license     agreements, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and     technical measures, including designing and manufacturing its     porous molding equipment and most of its molds in-house. Trade     secret laws do not afford the statutory exclusivity possible for     patented processes. There can be no assurance that the legal     protections afforded to Porex or the steps taken by Porex will     be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology. In     addition, these protections do not prevent independent     third-party development of competitive products or services.. The     nature of Porex's products exposes it to product liability     claims that may not be adequately covered by indemnity     agreements or insurance. The products sold by Porex, whether sold directly to end-users     or sold to other manufacturers for inclusion in the products     that they sell, expose it to potential risk of product liability     claims, particularly with respect to Porex's life sciences,     clinical, surgical and medical products. In addition, Porex is     subject to the risk that a government authority or third party     may require it to recall one or more of its products. Some of. 48. Table of Contents. Porex's products are designed to be permanently implanted     in the human body. Design defects and manufacturing defects with     respect to such products sold by Porex or failures that occur     with the products of Porex's manufacturer customers that     contain components made by Porex could result in product     liability claims     and/or a     recall of one or more of Porex's products. Porex believes     that it carries adequate insurance coverage against product     liability claims and other risks. We cannot assure you, however,     that claims in excess of Porex's insurance coverage will     not arise. In addition, Porex's insurance policies must be     renewed annually. Although Porex has been able to obtain     adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost in the past,     we cannot assure you that Porex will continue to be able to     obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost.. In most instances, Porex has indemnity arrangements with its     manufacturing customers. These indemnity arrangements generally     provide that these customers would indemnify Porex from     liabilities that may arise from the sale of their products that     incorporate Porex components to, or the use of such products by,     end-users. While Porex generally seeks contractual     indemnification from its customers, any such indemnification is     limited, as a practical matter, to the creditworthiness of the     indemnifying party. If Porex does not have adequate contractual     indemnification available, product liability claims, to the     extent not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse     effect on its business and its financial results.. Porex's     manufacturing and marketing of medical devices is subject to     extensive regulation by the FDA and its failure to meet     regulatory requirements could require it to pay fines, incur     other costs or close facilities. Porex's Surgical Products Group manufactures and markets     medical devices, such as reconstructive and aesthetic surgical     implants used in craniofacial applications and post-surgical     drains. In addition, Porex manufactures and markets blood serum     filters as a medical device for use in laboratory applications.     These products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA     under the FDC Act. The FDA's regulations govern, among     other things, product development, testing, manufacturing,     labeling, storage, premarket clearance (referred to as 510(k)     clearance), premarket approval (referred to as PMA approval),     advertising and promotion, and sales and distribution. In     addition, the Porex facilities and manufacturing techniques used     for manufacturing medical devices generally must conform to     standards that are established by the FDA and other government     agencies, including those of European and other foreign     governments. These regulatory agencies may conduct periodic     audits or inspections of such facilities or processes to monitor     Porex's compliance with applicable regulatory standards. If     the FDA finds that Porex has failed to comply with applicable     regulations, the agency can institute a wide variety of     enforcement actions, including: warning letters or untitled     letters; fines and civil penalties; unanticipated expenditures     to address or defend such actions; delays in clearing or     approving, or refusal to clear or approve, products; withdrawal     or suspension of approval of products; product recall or     seizure; orders for physician notification or device repair,     replacement or refund; interruption of production; operating     restrictions; injunctions; and criminal prosecution. Any adverse     action by an applicable regulatory agency could impair     Porex's ability to produce its medical device products in a     cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet customer     demands. Porex may also be required to bear other costs or take     other actions that may have a negative impact on its future     sales of such products and its ability to generate profits.. Some     of the companies to which Porex supplies its products are     subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and their failure to     meet regulatory requirements could adversely affect Porex's     business. Some of Porex's customers are medical device manufacturers     that use Porex products to make finished medical devices of     their own. Those customers are subject to extensive regulation     by the FDA     and/or     equivalent foreign regulatory authorities. Those regulatory     agencies may conduct periodic audits or inspections of their     facilities to monitor their compliance with applicable     regulatory standards. If the FDA finds that a Porex     customer's facility has failed to comply with applicable     regulations, the agency can institute, against such customer,     any of the enforcement actions identified in the risk factor     directly above regarding regulation of Porex. Any adverse action     by an applicable regulatory agency could impair the     customers' ability to. 49. Table of Contents. produce products and thus could decrease demand for Porex's     products or require Porex to bear additional costs.. In addition, modifications to Porex's customers'     products may require new regulatory approvals or clearances,     including 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals, or require     them to recall or cease marketing the modified devices until     these clearances or approvals are obtained. The FDA may not     approve or clear these product modifications for the indications     that are necessary or desirable for successful     commercialization. Indeed, the FDA may refuse Porex's     customers' requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket     approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to     existing products. Failure of such customers to receive     clearance or approval for new or modified products could reduce     or delay their purchases of Porex's products.. Economic,     political and other risks associated with Porex's     international sales and geographically diverse operations could     adversely affect Porex's operations and financial     results. Since Porex sells its products worldwide, its business is     subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.     In addition, Porex has manufacturing facilities in the United     Kingdom, Germany and Malaysia. Accordingly, Porex's     operations and financial results could be harmed by a variety of     factors, including:. <U+0095>            changes in foreign currency exchange rates;             <U+0095>            changes in a specific country's or region's political     or economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets;             <U+0095>            trade protection measures and import or export licensing     requirements;             <U+0095>            changes in tax laws;             <U+0095>            differing protection of intellectual property rights in     different countries; and             <U+0095>            changes in regulatory requirements.. Environmental     regulation could adversely affect Porex's     business. Porex is subject to foreign and domestic environmental laws and     regulations and is subject to scheduled and random checks by     environmental authorities. Porex's business involves the     handling, storage and disposal of materials that are classified     as hazardous. Although Porex's safety procedures for     handling, storage and disposal of these materials are designed     to comply with the standards prescribed by applicable laws and     regulations, Porex may be held liable for any environmental     damages that result from Porex's operations. Porex may be     required to pay fines, remediation costs and damages, which     could have a material adverse effect on its results of     operations.. Risks     Applicable to Our Entire Company and to Ownership of Our     Securities. Negative     conditions in the market for certain auction rate securities may     result in us incurring a loss on such investments. As of December 31, 2008, HLTH had a total of approximately     $355.0 million (face value) of investments in certain     auction rate securities (ARS) of which approximately     $164.8 million (face value) is attributable to WHC. Those     ARS had a fair value of $286.6 million (of which     $133.6 million is attributable to WHC). The types of ARS     investments that HLTH owns are backed by student loans, 97% of     which are guaranteed under the Federal Family Education Loan     Program (FFELP), and all had credit ratings of AAA or Aaa when     purchased. HLTH and its subsidiaries do not own any other type     of ARS investments.. Since February 2008, negative conditions in the regularly held     auctions for these securities have prevented holders from being     able to liquidate their holdings through that type of sale. In     the event HLTH needs to or wants to sell its ARS investments, it     may not be able to do so until a future auction on these types     of investments is successful or until a buyer is found outside     the auction process. If potential buyers are. 50. Table of Contents. unwilling to purchase the investments at their carrying amount,     HLTH would incur a loss on any such sales. In addition, the     credit ratings on some of the ARS investments in our portfolio     have been downgraded, and there may be additional such rating     downgrades in the future. If uncertainties in the credit and     capital markets continue, these markets deteriorate further or     ARS investments in our portfolio experience additional credit     rating downgrades, there could be further fair value adjustments     or other-than-temporary impairments in the carrying value of our     ARS investments.. The     ongoing investigations by the United States Attorney for the     District of South Carolina and the SEC could negatively impact     our company and divert management attention from our business     operations. The United States Attorney for the District of South Carolina is     conducting an investigation of our company. Based on the     information available to HLTH as of the date of this Annual     Report, we believe that the investigation relates principally to     issues of financial accounting improprieties for Medical Manager     Corporation, a predecessor of HLTH (by its merger into HLTH in     September 2000), and Medical Manager Health Systems, a former     subsidiary of HLTH; however, we cannot be sure of the     investigation's exact scope or how long it may continue. In     addition, HLTH understands that the SEC is conducting a formal     investigation into this matter. Adverse developments in     connection with the investigations, if any, including as a     result of matters that the authorities or HLTH may discover,     could have a negative impact on our company and on how it is     perceived by investors and potential investors and customers and     potential customers. In addition, the management effort and     attention required to respond to the investigations and any such     developments could have a negative impact on our business     operations.. HLTH intends to continue to fully cooperate with the authorities     in this matter. We believe that the amount of the expenses that     we will incur in connection with the investigations will     continue to be significant and we are not able to determine, at     this time, what portion of those amounts may ultimately be     covered by insurance or may ultimately be repaid to us by     individuals to whom we are advancing amounts for their defense     costs. In connection with the sale of Emdeon Practice Services     to Sage Software, we have agreed to indemnify Sage Software with     respect to this matter.. If     certain transactions occur with respect to our capital stock,     limitations may be imposed on our ability to utilize our net     operating loss carryforwards and tax credits to reduce our     income taxes. As of December 31, 2008, we had net operating loss     carryforwards of approximately $800 million for federal     income tax purposes and federal tax credits of approximately     $42 million, which excludes the impact of any unrecognized     tax benefits. If certain transactions occur with respect to our     capital stock, including issuances, redemptions,     recapitalizations, exercises of options, conversions of     convertible debt, purchases or sales by 5%-or-greater     shareholders and similar transactions, that result in a     cumulative change of more than 50% of the ownership of our     capital stock, over a three-year period, as determined under     rules prescribed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and     applicable Treasury regulations, an annual limitation would be     imposed with respect to our ability to utilize our net operating     loss carryforwards and federal tax credits. The tender offer     made by HLTH for its common stock that began on October 27,     2008 resulted in a cumulative change of more than 50% of the     ownership of our capital, as determined under rules prescribed     by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury     regulations. As a result of the ownership change, there will be     an annual limitation imposed on our ability to utilize our net     operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credits. Because     substantially all of our net operating loss carryforwards are     reserved for by a valuation allowance, we would not expect the     annual limitation on the utilization of our net operating loss     carryforwards to significantly reduce our net deferred tax     assets, although the timing of our cash flows may be impacted to     the extent any such annual limitation deferred the utilization     of our net operating loss carryforwards to future tax years.. We may     not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and     proprietary rights. Intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to     our businesses. The steps that we take to protect our     intellectual property, proprietary information and trade secrets     may prove to be inadequate and, whether or not adequate, may be     expensive. We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent and     other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures     and non-disclosure contractual provisions to protect. 51. Table of Contents. our intellectual property. We cannot assure you that we will be     able to detect potential or actual misappropriation or     infringement of our intellectual property, proprietary     information or trade secrets. Even if we detect misappropriation     or infringement by a third party, we cannot assure you that we     will be able to enforce our rights at a reasonable cost, or at     all. In addition, our rights to intellectual property,     proprietary information and trade secrets may not prevent     independent third-party development and commercialization of     competing products or services.. Third     parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual     property, and we could suffer significant litigation or     licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or     services. We could be subject to claims that we are misappropriating or     infringing intellectual property or other proprietary rights of     others. These claims, even if not meritorious, could be     expensive to defend and divert management's attention from     our operations. If we become liable to third parties for     infringing these rights, we could be required to pay a     substantial damage award and to develop non-infringing     technology, obtain a license or cease selling the products or     services that use or contain the infringing intellectual     property. We may be unable to develop non-infringing products or     services or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms,     or at all. We may also be required to indemnify our customers if     they become subject to third-party claims relating to     intellectual property that we license or otherwise provide to     them, which could be costly.. Acquisitions,     business combinations and other transactions may be difficult to     complete and, if completed, may have negative consequences for     our business and our securityholders. We may seek to acquire or to engage in business combinations     with companies engaged in complementary businesses. In addition,     we may enter into joint ventures, strategic alliances or similar     arrangements with third parties. These transactions may result     in changes in the nature and scope of our operations and changes     in our financial condition. Our success in completing these     types of transactions will depend on, among other things, our     ability to locate suitable candidates and negotiate mutually     acceptable terms with them, as well as the availability of     financing. Significant competition for these opportunities     exists, which may increase the cost of and decrease the     opportunities for these types of transactions.. Financing for these transactions may come from several sources,     including:. <U+0095>            cash and cash equivalents on hand and marketable securities;             <U+0095>            proceeds from the incurrence of indebtedness by HLTH or its     subsidiaries; and             <U+0095>            proceeds from the issuance of additional common stock, preferred     stock, convertible debt or other securities of HLTH or its     subsidiaries.. Our issuance of additional securities could:. <U+0095>            cause substantial dilution of the percentage ownership of our     stockholders at the time of the issuance;             <U+0095>            cause substantial dilution of our earnings per share;             <U+0095>            subject us to the risks associated with increased leverage,     including a reduction in our ability to obtain financing or an     increase in the cost of any financing we obtain;             <U+0095>            subject us to restrictive covenants that could limit our     flexibility in conducting future business activities; and             <U+0095>            adversely affect the prevailing market price for our outstanding     securities.. We do not intend to seek securityholder approval for any such     acquisition or security issuance unless required by applicable     law or regulation or the terms of existing securities.. 52. Table of Contents. Our     business will suffer if we fail to successfully integrate     acquired businesses and technologies or to assess the risks in     particular transactions. We have in the past acquired, and may in the future acquire,     businesses, technologies, services, product lines and other     assets. The successful integration of the acquired businesses     and assets into our operations, on a cost-effective basis, can     be critical to our future performance. The amount and timing of     the expected benefits of any acquisition, including potential     synergies between HLTH and the acquired business, are subject to     significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and     uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those relating to:. <U+0095>            our ability to maintain relationships with the customers of the     acquired business;             <U+0095>            our ability to cross-sell products and services to customers     with which we have established relationships and those with     which the acquired businesses have established relationships;             <U+0095>            our ability to retain or replace key personnel;             <U+0095>            potential conflicts in payer, provider, strategic partner,     sponsor or advertising relationships;             <U+0095>            our ability to coordinate organizations that are geographically     diverse and may have different business cultures; and             <U+0095>            compliance with regulatory requirements.. We cannot guarantee that any acquired businesses will be     successfully integrated with our operations in a timely or     cost-effective manner, or at all. Failure to successfully     integrate acquired businesses or to achieve anticipated     operating synergies, revenue enhancements or cost savings could     have a material adverse effect on our business, financial     condition and results of operations.. Although our management attempts to evaluate the risks inherent     in each transaction and to value acquisition candidates     appropriately, we cannot assure you that we will properly     ascertain all such risks or that acquired businesses and assets     will perform as we expect or enhance the value of our company as     a whole. In addition, acquired companies or businesses may have     larger than expected liabilities that are not covered by the     indemnification, if any, that we are able to obtain from the     sellers.. We     will incur significant additional non-cash interest expense upon     the adoption of FASB Staff Position No. APB     14-1,     \"Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that May be     Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash     Settlement)\". On May 9, 2008, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (or     FASB) issued FASB Staff Position No. APB     14-1,     \"Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that May be     Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash     Settlement),\" which will significantly impact the     accounting for convertible debt when it is adopted during the     first quarter of 2009. The FSP will require cash settled     convertible debt to be separated into debt and equity components     at issuance and a value to be assigned to each. The value     assigned to the debt component will be the estimated fair value,     as of the issuance date, of a similar bond without the     conversion feature. The difference between the bond's cash     proceeds and this estimated fair value will be recorded as a     debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of     the bond. Although FSP APB     14-1 will     have no impact on our actual past or future cash flows, it will     require us to record a significant amount of non-cash interest     expense as the debt discount is amortized. In addition, if the     convertible debt is redeemed or converted prior to maturity, any     unamortized debt discount will result in a loss on     extinguishment. FSP APB     14-1 will     become effective as of January 1, 2009, and will require     retrospective application. We currently expect that the adoption     of FSP APB     14-1 will     result in the recognition of incremental non-cash interest     expense of approximately $8 million and $7 million for     the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.. We may     not be able to raise additional funds when needed for our     business or to exploit opportunities. Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon     numerous factors, including the success of our service     offerings, market developments, and repurchases of our common     stock. We may need to raise additional funds to support     expansion, develop new or enhanced applications and services,     respond to. 53. Table of Contents. competitive pressures, acquire complementary businesses or     technologies or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities.     In addition, holders of the 1.75% Convertible Subordinated     Notes due 2023 issued by HLTH may, at their option, require HLTH     to repurchase their Notes on certain specified dates (the     earliest of which is June 15, 2010) and holders of the     31/8% Convertible     Notes due 2025 issued by HLTH may, at their option, require HLTH     to repurchase their Notes on certain specified dates (the     earliest of which is September 1, 2012), in each case at a     price equal to 100% of the principal amount being repurchased.     If required, we may raise such additional funds through public     or private debt or equity financing, strategic relationships or     other arrangements. There can be no assurance that such     financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, or     that such financing will not be dilutive to our stockholders.. As widely reported, financial markets have been experiencing     extreme disruption recently, including volatility in the prices     of securities and severely diminished liquidity and availability     of credit. Until this disruption in the financial markets is     resolved, financing will be even more difficult to get on     acceptable terms and we could be forced to cancel or delay     investments or transactions that we would otherwise have made.. Our     decision to sell Porex may have a negative impact on that     business. As a result of our plan to divest Porex, the financial results     and operations of that business may be adversely affected by the     diversion of management resources to the sale process and by     uncertainty regarding the outcome of the process. For example,     the uncertainty of who will own Porex in the future could lead     Porex to lose or fail to attract employees, customers or     business partners. Although we have taken steps to address these     risks, there can be no assurance that any such losses or     distractions will not adversely affect the operations or     financial results of Porex and, as a result, the sale price that     we may receive for Porex."
