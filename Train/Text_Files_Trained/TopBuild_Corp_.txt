[1] "Item 1A.  RISK FACTORS. There are a number of business risks and uncertainties that could affect our business and cause our actual results to differ from past performance or expected results.  We consider the following risks and uncertainties to be those material to our business activities.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe to be immaterial, also may impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this Annual Report.. Our business relies on residential new construction activity, and to a lesser extent on residential repair/remodel and commercial construction activity, all of which are cyclical.. Macroeconomic and local economic conditions, including consumer confidence levels, fluctuations in home prices, unemployment and underemployment levels, student loan debt, household formation rates, mortgage tax deduction limits, the age and volume of the housing stock, the availability of home equity loans and mortgages and the interest rates for such loans, and other factors, affect consumers' discretionary spending on both residential new construction projects and residential repair/remodel activity.  The commercial construction market is affected by macroeconomic and local economic factors such as interest rates, credit availability for commercial construction projects, material costs, employment rates, office vacancy rates, and office absorption rates.  Changes or uncertainty regarding these and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position.. We may not be successful in identifying and making or integrating acquisitions.. Part of our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to make acquisitions.  We may be unable to make accretive acquisitions or realize expected benefits of any acquisitions for any of the following reasons:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure to identify attractive targets in the marketplace;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations or assets, expected cost reductions, or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring operations or assets;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure to obtain acceptable financing; or. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions in our debt agreements.. Acquisitions involve risks that could negatively affect our operating results, cash flows, and liquidity.. We have made, and in the future may continue to make, strategic acquisitions, which may expose us to operational challenges and risks, including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability to profitably manage acquired businesses or successfully integrate the acquired business' operations, financial reporting, and accounting control systems into our business;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe expense of integrating acquired businesses;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased indebtedness;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability to fund cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated revenue is not realized or is delayed, whether by general economic or market conditions, or unforeseen internal difficulties;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of funding sufficient to meet increased capital needs;. 8. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiversion of management's attention; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability to retain or hire qualified personnel required for expanded operations.. In addition, acquired companies may have liabilities that we failed, or were unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations. We cannot assure you that the indemnification granted to us by sellers of acquired companies will be sufficient in amount, scope, or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with businesses or properties we assume upon consummation of an acquisition. We may learn additional information about our acquired businesses that could materially adversely affect us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and liabilities related to compliance with applicable laws. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Failure to successfully manage the operational challenges and risks associated with, or resulting from, acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Borrowings or issuances of debt associated with these acquisitions could also result in higher levels of indebtedness which could affect our ability to service our debt within the scheduled repayment terms.. We are dependent on third - party suppliers and manufacturers to provide us with an adequate supply of quality products, and the loss of a large supplier or manufacturer could negatively affect our operating results.. Failure by our suppliers to provide us with an adequate supply of quality products on commercially reasonable terms, or to comply with applicable legal requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.  While we believe that we have generally positive relationships with our suppliers, the fiberglass insulation industry has encountered both shortages and periods of significant oversupply during past housing market cycles, leading to volatility in prices and allocations of supply, affecting our results.  While we do not believe we depend on any sole or limited source of supply, we do source the majority of our building products, primarily insulation, from a limited number of large suppliers.  The loss of a large supplier, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products or components from our suppliers, could disrupt our business and adversely affect our operating results.. The long - term performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented personnel, including sales representatives, branch managers, installers, and truck drivers, while controlling our labor costs.. We are highly dependent on the skills and experience of our senior management team and other skilled and experienced personnel.  The failure to attract and retain key employees could negatively affect our competitive position and operating results.. Our ability to control labor costs and attract qualified labor is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates, labor shortages, the impact of legislation or regulations governing wages and hours, labor relations, immigration, healthcare benefits, and other insurance costs.  In addition, we compete with other companies to recruit and retain qualified installers and truck drivers in a tight labor market, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction.  These positions generally have high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs.. Because we operate our business through highly dispersed locations across the U.S., our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent local practices and the operating results of individual branches and distribution centers may vary.. Our operating structure can make it difficult for us to coordinate procedures across our operations.  In addition, our branches and distribution facilities may require significant oversight and coordination from headquarters to support their growth.  Inconsistent implementation of corporate strategy and policies at the local or regional level could materially and adversely affect our overall profitability, business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.. 9. Table of Contents. Our profit margins could decrease due to changes in the costs of the products we install and/or distribute.. The principal building products that we install and distribute have been subject to price changes in the past, some of which have been significant.  Our results of operations for individual quarters can be, and have been, hurt by a delay between the time building product cost increases are implemented and the time we are able to increase prices for our installation or distribution services, if at all.  Our supplier purchase prices may depend on our purchasing volume or other arrangements with any given supplier.  While we have been able to achieve cost savings through volume purchasing or other arrangements with suppliers in the past, we may not be able to consistently continue to receive advantageous pricing for the products we distribute and install.  If we are unable to maintain pricing consistent with prior periods, our costs could increase and our margins may be adversely affected.. We face significant competition.. The market for the distribution and installation of building products is highly fragmented and competitive and barriers to entry are relatively low.  Our installation competitors include national contractors, regional contractors, and local contractors, and we face many or all of these competitors for each project on which we bid.  Our insulation distribution competitors include specialty insulation distributors (one multi - regional, several regional, and numerous local).  In some instances, our insulation distribution business sells products to companies that may compete directly with our installation service business.  We also compete with broad line building products distributors, big box retailers, and insulation manufacturers.  In addition to price, we believe that competition in our industry is based largely on customer service and the quality and timeliness of installation services and distribution product deliveries in each local market.. Our business is seasonal and is susceptible to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters.  We also may be adversely affected by any natural or man-made disruptions to our facilities.. We normally experience stronger sales during the third and fourth calendar quarters, corresponding with the peak season for residential new construction and residential repair/remodel activity.  Sales during the winter weather months are seasonally slower due to the lower construction activity.  Historically, the installation of insulation lags housing starts by several months.. In addition, to the extent that hurricanes, severe storms, earthquakes, droughts, floods, fires, other natural disasters, or similar events occur in the geographic areas in which we operate, our business may be adversely affected.. Any widespread disruption to our facilities resulting from a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, or any other cause could damage a significant portion of our inventory and supply stock, and could materially impair our ability to provide installation and/or distribution services for our customers.. Claims and litigation could be costly.. We are, from time to time, involved in various claims, litigation matters, and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business and which could have a material adverse effect on us.  These matters may include contract disputes, automobile liability and other personal injury claims, warranty disputes, environmental claims or proceedings, other tort claims, employment and tax matters, the quality of products sourced from our suppliers, and other proceedings and litigation, including class actions.  In addition, we are exposed to potential claims by our employees or others based on job related hazards.. We have also experienced class action lawsuits in recent years predicated upon claims for antitrust, product liability, construction defects, competition, and wage and hour issues.  We have generally denied liability and have vigorously defended these cases.  Due to their scope and complexity, however, these lawsuits can be particularly costly to defend and resolve, and we have and may continue to incur significant costs as a result of these types of lawsuits.. Our builder and contractor customers are subject to construction defect and warranty claims in the ordinary course of their business.  Our contractual arrangements with these customers may include our agreement to defend and indemnify them against various liabilities.. 10. Table of Contents. Although we intend to defend all claims and litigation matters vigorously, given the inherently unpredictable nature of claims and litigation, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or litigation matter.. We expect to maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation.  We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.  The levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities.  If any significant accident, judgment, claim, or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. We may not be able to identify new products and new product lines and integrate them into our distribution network, which may impact our ability to compete.  Our expansion into new markets may present competitive, distribution, and regulatory challenges that differ from current ones.. Our business depends in part on our ability to identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers' needs.  We may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products.  In addition, our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our distribution network could affect our ability to compete.. We are subject to competitive pricing pressure from our customers.. Residential homebuilders historically have exerted significant pressure on their outside suppliers to keep prices low because of their market share, and ability to leverage such market share, in the highly fragmented building products supply and services industry.  In addition, consolidation among homebuilders, and changes in homebuilders' purchasing policies or payment practices could result in additional pricing pressure.. The development of alternatives to distributors in the supply chain could cause a decrease in our sales and operating results and limit our ability to grow our business.. Our distribution customers could begin purchasing more of their products directly from manufacturers, which would result in decreases in our net sales and earnings.  Our suppliers could invest in infrastructure to expand their own local sales force and sell more products directly to our distribution customers, which also would negatively impact our business.  In addition, our distribution customers may elect to establish their own building products manufacturing and distribution facilities, or give advantages to manufacturing or distribution intermediaries in which they have an economic stake.. Union organizing activity and work stoppages could delay or reduce availability of products that we install and increase our costs.. Approximately 700 of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining or other similar labor agreements that expire on various dates from March 2018 through June 2023.  Any inability by us to negotiate collective bargaining arrangements could cause strikes or other work stoppages, and new contracts could result in increased operating costs.  If any such strikes or other work stoppages occur, or if other employees become represented by a union, we could experience a disruption of our operations and higher labor costs.  Further, if a significant number of additional employees were to unionize, including in the wake of any future legislation that makes it easier for employees to unionize, these risks would increase.  In addition, certain of our suppliers have unionized work forces, and certain of the products we install and/or distribute are transported by unionized truckers.  Strikes, work stoppages, or slowdowns could result in slowdowns or closures of facilities where the products that we install and/or distribute are manufactured, or could affect the ability of our suppliers to deliver such products to us.  Any interruption in the production or delivery of these products could delay or reduce availability of these products and increase our costs.. 11. Table of Contents. If we are required to take significant non - cash charges, our financial resources could be reduced and our financial flexibility may be negatively affected.. We have significant goodwill and other intangible assets related to business combinations on our balance sheet.  The valuation of these assets is largely dependent upon the expectations for future performance of our businesses.  Expectations about the growth of residential new construction, commercial construction, and residential repair/remodel activity may impact whether we are required to recognize non - cash, pre - tax impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinite - lived intangible assets or other long - lived assets.  If the value of our goodwill, other intangible assets, or long - lived assets is further impaired, our earnings and stockholders' equity would be adversely affected and may impact our ability to raise capital in the future.. Compliance with government regulation and industry standards could impact our operating results.. We are subject to federal, state, and local government regulations, particularly those pertaining to health and safety, including protection of employees and consumers; employment laws, including immigration and wage and hour regulations; contractor licensing; and environmental issues.  In addition to complying with current requirements, even more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future.  Compliance with these regulations and industry standards is costly and may require us to alter our installation and distribution processes, product sourcing, or business practices, and makes recruiting and retaining labor in a tight labor market more challenging.  Compliance with these regulations and industry standards could also divert our attention and resources to compliance activities, and could cause us to incur higher costs.  Further, if we do not effectively and timely comply with such regulations and industry standards, our results of operations could be negatively affected and we could become subject to substantial penalties or other legal liability.. If we encounter difficulties with our information technology systems, we could experience problems with customer service, inventory, collections, and cost control.. Our operations are dependent upon our information technology systems to manage customer orders on a timely basis, to coordinate our installation and distribution activities across locations, and to manage invoicing.  If we experience problems with our information technology systems, we could experience, among other things, delays in receiving customer orders, placing orders with suppliers, and scheduling production, installation services, or shipments.. Since we rely heavily on information technology, both in serving our customers and in our enterprise infrastructure, in order to achieve our objectives, we may be vulnerable to damage or intrusion from a variety of cyber - attacks including computer viruses, worms, or other malicious software programs that gain access to our systems.  Such events could have an adverse impact on revenue, harm our reputation, and cause us to incur legal liability and costs, which could be significant, to address and remediate such events and related security concerns.. Our business relies significantly on the expertise of our employees, and we generally do not have intellectual property that is protected by patents.. Our business is significantly dependent upon our expertise in installation and distribution logistics, including significant expertise in the application of building science through our Environments for Living® program.  We rely on a combination of trade secrets and contractual confidentiality provisions and, to a much lesser extent, copyrights and trademarks, to protect our proprietary rights.  Accordingly, our intellectual property is more vulnerable than it would be if it were protected primarily by patents.  We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our proprietary rights, and in the event a misappropriation or breach of our proprietary rights occurs, our competitive position in the market may be harmed.  In addition, competitors may develop competing technologies and expertise that renders our expertise obsolete or less valuable.. 12. Table of Contents. Changes in building codes and consumer preferences could affect our ability to market our service offerings and our profitability.  Moreover, if we do not respond to evolving customer preferences or changes in building standards, or if we do not maintain or expand our leadership in building science, our business, results of operation, financial condition, and cash flow would be adversely affected.. Each of our lines of business is impacted by local and state building codes and consumer preferences, including a growing focus on energy efficiency.  Our competitive advantage is due, in part, to our ability to respond to changes in consumer preferences and building codes.  However, if our installation and distribution services do not adequately or quickly adapt to changing preferences and building standards, we may lose market share to competitors, which would adversely affect our business, results of operation, financial condition, and cash flows.  Further, our growth prospects could be harmed if consumer preferences and building standards evolve more slowly than we anticipate towards energy - efficient service offerings, which are more profitable than minimum code service offerings.. We may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.. Economic and credit market conditions, the performance of the construction industry, and our financial performance, as well as other factors may constrain our financing abilities.  Our ability to secure additional financing and to satisfy our financial obligations will depend upon our future operating performance; the availability of credit; economic conditions; and financial, business, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.. Restrictions in our existing credit facility, or any other indebtedness we may incur in the future, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to make distributions to shareholders, and the value of our common stock.. Our existing term loan and revolving credit facility, or any future credit facility or other indebtedness we enter into, may limit our ability to, among other things:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIncur or guarantee additional debt. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tMake distributions or dividends on, or redeem or repurchase shares of our common stock. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tMake certain investments, acquisitions, or other restricted payments. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIncur certain liens or permit them to exist. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAcquire, merge, or consolidate with another company. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tTransfer, sell, or otherwise dispose of substantially all of our assets. Our revolving credit facility contains, and any future credit facility or other debt instrument we may enter into will also likely contain, covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios and meet certain tests, such as a fixed charge coverage ratio, a leverage ratio, and a minimum test (see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).  Our ability to comply with those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to comply with those ratios and tests when required to do so under the applicable debt instruments.. The provisions of our credit facility, or other debt instruments, may affect our ability to obtain future financing and pursue attractive business opportunities and our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions.  In addition, a failure to comply with the provisions of our existing credit facility, any future credit facility, or other debt instruments could result in a default or an event of default that could enable our lenders or other debt holders to declare the outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable.  If the payment of our debt is accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and our stockholders could experience a partial or total loss of their investment.. 13. Table of Contents. Adverse credit ratings could increase our costs of borrowing money and limit our access to capital markets and commercial credit.. Our credit is not currently rated by Moody's Investor Service, Standard & Poor's, or another rating service.  However, if Moody's, Standard & Poor's, or another rating service rates our credit, such rating could be below investment grade, which may increase our borrowing costs.  Additionally, if our indebtedness were rated, then any subsequent downgrade of such rating could further increase our borrowing costs or otherwise limit our access to the capital and commercial credit markets.. Our historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of our future financial condition or future results of operations, nor does it reflect what our financial condition or results of operations would have been as an independent public company during the periods presented prior to the Separation.. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur historical financial results for the period prior to the Separation reflect allocations of expenses for services historically provided by Masco, and this allocation of Masco corporate expenses may be significantly lower than the comparable expenses we would have incurred as an independent company during such period.. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur working capital requirements and capital expenditures for the periods prior to the Separation were satisfied as part of Masco's corporate - wide cash management and capital expenditure programs, and our cost of debt and other capital may have significantly differed from that reflected in our historical financial statements.. The historical financial information prior to the Separation may not fully reflect the costs associated with being an independent public company.. In connection with the Separation, Masco indemnified us for certain liabilities and we indemnified Masco for certain liabilities.  If we are required to act under these indemnities to Masco, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations, which could adversely affect our financial results.  Moreover, the Masco indemnity may not be sufficient to compensate us for the full amount of liabilities for which it may be liable, and Masco may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations to us in the future.. Indemnities that we may be required to provide Masco are not subject to any cap, may be significant, and could negatively affect our business, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could affect the tax - free nature of the Separation.  Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Masco has agreed to retain, and under certain circumstances, we may be subject to continuing contingent liabilities of Masco following the Separation, such as certain shareholder litigation claims.  Further, Masco may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations or such indemnity obligations may not be sufficient to cover our liabilities.  Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Masco any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves.  Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.. Compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.. We are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions including income taxes; indirect taxes which include excise and duty, sales and use, and gross receipts taxes; payroll taxes; franchise taxes; withholding taxes; and ad valorem taxes.  New tax laws and regulations, and changes in existing tax laws and regulations, are continuously being enacted or proposed which could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future.  Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority.  Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties.. 14. Table of Contents. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock. The price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially, and the value of your investment may decline.. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFluctuations in our quarterly or annual earnings results, or those of other companies in our industry. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFailures of our operating results to meet our guidance the estimates of securities analysts or the expectations of our stockholders, or changes by securities analysts in their estimates of our future earnings. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAnnouncements by us or our customers, suppliers, or competitors. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in laws or regulations which adversely affect our industry or us. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tGeneral economic, industry, and stock market conditions. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFuture sales of our common stock by our stockholders. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFuture issuances of our common stock by us. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOther factors described in these \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and certain provisions of Delaware law, could delay or prevent a change in control.. The existence of some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable.  These include provisions:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tProviding for a classified board of directors. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tProviding that our directors may be removed by our stockholders only for cause. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tEstablishing supermajority vote requirements for our stockholders to amend certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAuthorizing a large number of shares of stock that are not yet issued, which could have the effect of preventing or delaying a change in control if our board of directors issued shares to persons that did not support such change in control, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tProhibiting stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders or taking action by written consent. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tEstablishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at the annual stockholder meetings. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may have an anti - takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that could have resulted in a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock.. 15. Table of Contents. These provisions apply even if a takeover offer is considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our and our stockholders' best interests.. Our bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a preferred judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees.. Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, or other employee to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation (including any certificate of designations for any class or series of our preferred stock), or our bylaws, in each case, as amended from time to time, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, shall be a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, in all cases subject to the court's having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have received notice of, and consented to, the foregoing provision.  This forum selection provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable or cost - effective for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and employees."
