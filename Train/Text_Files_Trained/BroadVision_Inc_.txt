[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. <U+FEFF>. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business could be harmed. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline.. <U+FEFF>. Risks related to our business and industry. <U+FEFF>. Our business currently depends on revenue related to BroadVision e-business solutions, and we expect that this revenue will continue to decline.. We generate a large portion of our revenue from legacy products, including Business Agility Suite, Commerce Agility Suite and QuickSilver. We expect that these products, and future upgraded versions, will continue to account for a large portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future. We expect that our future financial performance, until we establish a significant installed base of new product revenues, will depend on our ability to sustain our legacy business, which we expect to continue to decline as the result of a decrease in market demand for these products and related products and services. If we fail to deliver the product enhancements that customers want, or if competitors overtake our legacy customers, demand for our legacy products and services, and our revenue, may further decline.. We continue to introduce new products, services and technologies and our business will be harmed if we are not successful in selling these offerings to our existing customers and new customers.. <U+FEFF>. We entered into the business of ESN with the initial release of Clearvale in 2009.  We announced the integration of Clearvale's social and mobile capabilities into our legacy products, as BroadVision 9 in 2013. We have been actively enhancing Clearvale, by adding new functions and editions. We have spent significant resources in developing these offerings and training our employees to implement, support, operate, sell and market the offerings.  In February 2015 we launched our newest communication and collaboration offering, Vmoso, and we announced a major incremental release of our Vmoso platform with a range of new functionality across several key modules in September 2016. To date our Vmoso, Clearvale and BroadVision 9 offerings have only contributed to a minor portion of our revenue. We do not yet know whether any of these new offerings will grow into a significant business line, and if so, whether sales of these new offerings will be sufficient for us to offset the costs of development, implementation, support, operation, sales and marketing. Although we have performed extensive testing of our products and technologies, their broad-based implementation may require more support than we anticipate, which would further increase our expenses. If sales of our new products, services and technologies are lower than we expect, or if we must lower our prices or delay implementation to fix unforeseen problems and develop modifications, our operating margins are likely to decrease and we may not be able to operate profitably.. <U+FEFF>. 6. We have introduced Cloud-based offerings.  Our business will be harmed and our growth potential will be limited, if we are unable to provide reliable, scalable, and cost-efficient Cloud hosting operation.. <U+FEFF>. Historically, BroadVision has offered perpetual software licenses, with customers responsible for the IT equipment needed for running BroadVision software.   The Vmoso,  Clearvale and Clear products, on the other hand, include Cloud-based offerings, where BroadVision provides hosted IT equipment and operation for subscribing customers.  The Cloud model is also known as Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS.  Our SaaS operations rely upon a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations. We have designed our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by cloud computing service providers. Currently, our worldwide cloud service providers include leading cloud infrastructure providers such as Amazon. Any disruption of or interference with our use of cloud computing services would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. BroadVision has limited prior experience in operating Cloud hosting.   We may be unable to timely provide adequate computing capacity to keep up with business growth and performance requirements.  Our hosted operation may fail due to hardware problems, software problems, power problems, network problems, scalability problems, human errors, hacker attacks, disasters, third-party data center problems and other reasons.  The failures may cause us to compromise security, lose customer data or identity, endure prolonged downtime, etc., all of which will harm our business and limit our growth.   BroadVision has limited prior experience in estimating the costs of Cloud hosting.  If we underestimate the costs or under-charge customers, we may not have adequate margins to sustain our Cloud hosting operation.  Vmoso and Clearvale allow customers to use basic functions for free, a business practice gaining popularity in our industry.   If we do not have enough customers upgrading to for-fee premium packages, we may be unable to sustain our Cloud hosting operation economically.. <U+FEFF>. Current and potential competitors could make it difficult for us to acquire and retain customers now and in the future.. <U+FEFF>. The market for our products is intensely competitive. We expect competition in this market to persist and increase in the future. If we fail to compete successfully with current or future competitors, we may be unable to attract and retain customers. Increased competition could also result in price reductions for our products and lower profit margins and reduced market share, any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, greater name recognition, a broader range of products and a larger installed customer base, any of which could provide them with a significant competitive advantage. In addition, new competitors, or alliances among existing and future competitors, may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share. Some of our competitors, particularly established software vendors, may also be able to provide customers with products and services comparable to ours at lower or at aggressively reduced prices in an effort to increase market share or as part of a broader software package they are selling to a customer. We may be unable to match competitor's prices or price reductions, and we may fail to win customers that choose to purchase an information technology solution as part of a broader software and services package. As a result, we may be unable to compete successfully with current or new competitors.. If we are unable to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in online commerce, portal, social networking and enterprise software, our products and services may fail to be competitive.. <U+FEFF>. Our products and services may fail to be competitive if we do not maintain or exceed the pace of technological developments in mobile, cloud-computing, social and enterprise solutions. Failure to be competitive could cause our revenue to decline. The information services, software and communications industries are characterized by rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards and practices. The introduction of products and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices can render existing products and services obsolete. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to:. • \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tdevelop leading technologies; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tenhance our existing products and services; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tdevelop new products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers; and \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\trespond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis.. We have a history of losses and our future profitability on a quarterly or annual basis is uncertain, which could have a harmful effect on our business and the value of BroadVision common stock.. Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.   As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.3 billion.. For the foreseeable future we expect our results of operations to fluctuate, and during this period we may incur losses and/or negative cash flows. If our revenue does not increase or if we fail to maintain our expenses at an amount less than our projected revenue, we will not be able to achieve or sustain operating profitability on a consistent basis.. 7. Our failure to operate profitably or control negative cash flows on a quarterly or annual basis could harm our business and the value of BroadVision common stock. If the negative cash flow continues, our liquidity and ability to operate our business would be severely and adversely impacted. Additionally, our ability to raise financial capital may be hindered due to our operational losses and negative cash flows, reducing our operating flexibility.. <U+FEFF>. Our quarterly operating results are volatile and difficult to predict, and our stock price may decline if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.. Historically our quarterly operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter and are likely to continue to vary significantly in the future. If our revenues, operating results, earnings or projections are below the levels expected by securities analysts or investors, our stock price is likely to decline.. We are likely to continue to experience significant fluctuations in our future results of operations due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control, including:. • \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tintroduction of products and services and enhancements by us and our competitors; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tcompetitive factors that affect our pricing; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tmarket acceptance of new products; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tthe mix of products sold by us; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tthe timing of receipt, fulfillment and recognition as revenue of significant orders; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tchanges in our pricing policies or our competitors; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tchanges in our sales incentive plans; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tthe budgeting cycles of our customers; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tcustomer order deferrals in anticipation of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us or because of macro-economic conditions; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tnonrenewal of our maintenance agreements, which generally automatically renew for one-year terms unless earlier terminated by either party upon 90 days notice; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tproduct life cycles; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tchanges in strategy; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tseasonal trends; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tthe mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tthe mix of international and domestic sales; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tthe rate at which new sales people become productive; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tchanges in the level of operating expenses to support projected growth; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tincrease in the amount of third party products and services that we use in our products or resell with royalties attached; and \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tcosts associated with litigation, regulatory compliance and other corporate events such as operational reorganizations.. <U+FEFF>. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results are not necessarily meaningful, and that these comparisons are not accurate indicators of future performance. Because our staffing and operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels, and because a high percentage of our costs are fixed, small variations in the timing of the recognition of specific revenue could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter. If we were unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any revenue shortfall, any significant revenue shortfall would likely have an immediate negative effect on our operating results. If our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, we would expect to experience an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our stock.. Our sales and product implementation cycles are lengthy and subject to delay, which make it difficult to predict our quarterly results.. Our sales and product implementation cycles generally span months. Delays in customer orders or product implementations, which are difficult to predict, can affect the timing of revenue recognition and can adversely affect our quarterly operating results. Licensing our products is often an enterprise-wide decision by prospective customers. The importance of this decision requires that we engage in a lengthy sales cycle with prospective customers. A successful sales cycle may last up to nine months or longer. Our sales cycle is also affected by a number of other factors, some of which we have little or no control over, including the volatility of the overall software market, the business condition and purchasing cycle of each prospective customer, and the performance of our technology partners, systems integrators and resellers. The implementation of our products can also be time and resource intensive, and subject to unexpected delays. Delays in either product sales or implementations could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.. <U+FEFF>. 8. Because a significant portion of our sales activity occurs at the end of each fiscal quarter, delays in a relatively small number of license transactions could adversely affect our quarterly operating results.. A significant proportion of our sales are concentrated in the last month of each fiscal quarter. Gross margins are high for our license transactions. Customers and prospective customers may use these conditions in an attempt to obtain more favorable terms. While we endeavor to avoid making concessions that could result in lower margins, the negotiations often result in delays in closing license transactions. Small delays in a relatively small number of license transactions could have a significant impact on our reported operating results for that quarter.. <U+FEFF>. We face liquidity challenges and will need additional financing in the future.. We currently expect to be able to fund our working capital requirements from our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments through the next twelve months. However, we could experience unforeseen circumstances, such as an economic downturn, difficulties in retaining customers and/or employees, or other factors that could increase our use of available cash and require us to seek additional financing. We may find it necessary to obtain additional equity or debt financing due to the factors listed above or in order to support a more rapid expansion, develop new or enhanced products or services, respond to competitive pressures, acquire complementary businesses or technologies or respond to unanticipated requirements.. We have implemented cost reduction plans since the second half of 2017 and expect to reduce the cost of our operations by approximately $2 million in 2018 to cover our cash needs through the next twelve months. Management may implement further cost reductions in 2018 or seek financing from third parties as needed to ensure that our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are sufficient to fund operations for the next twelve months.  However, further cost reductions may result in voluntary departures of highly skilled technical and managerial personnel from our company, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, internal controls, financial condition and results of operations. We may seek to raise additional funds through private or public sales of securities, strategic relationships, bank debt, financing under leasing arrangements or otherwise. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our current stockholders will be reduced, stockholders may experience additional dilution or any equity securities we sell may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock. We expect that obtaining additional financing on acceptable terms would be difficult. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to pay our debts as they become due, develop our products, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and future operating results. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully accomplish these plans and secure sources of financing and/or reduce costs and ultimately attain profitable operations.. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. If we are unable to maintain our disclosure controls and procedures, including our internal control over financial reporting, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected.. We have evaluated our \"disclosure controls and procedures\" as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Effective controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our operating results could be harmed. Our internal control over financial reporting has been designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. For example,  we delayed the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, in connection with our discovery that a former employee of one of our wholly-owned German subsidiaries, Interleaf Germany, had fraudulently misappropriated funds from us and falsified records to conceal the theft.. <U+FEFF>. We cannot assure you that our controls and procedures will prevent all errors or fraud, or that any related losses would be recoverable. We also cannot assure you that similar circumstances will not arise in the future that will cause us to delay the filing of our periodic consolidated financial reports and, if we are unable to produce accurate or timely consolidated financial statements, we may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions or investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, our stock price may be adversely affected, our reputation may suffer and we may be unable to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq Capital  Market continued listing requirements.  Further, our independent registered public accounting firm did not perform an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting during the impacted periods in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In light of the fraudulent activities that were identified as a result of the limited procedures performed, it is possible that, had our independent registered public accounting firm performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, additional instances of fraud, or significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, may have been identified.. In addition, maintaining sufficient expertise and historical institutional knowledge in our accounting and finance organization is dependent upon retaining existing employees and filling any open positions with experienced personnel in a timely fashion. The market for skilled accounting and finance personnel is competitive and we may have continued difficulty in retaining our staff because the region. 9. in which we compete consists of many established companies that can offer more lucrative compensation packages. Our inability to staff the department with competent personnel with sufficient training will affect our internal controls over financial reporting to the extent that we may not be able to prevent or detect material misstatements.. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.. <U+FEFF>. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the FASB and the SEC. A change in these policies or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, may retroactively affect previously reported results, could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, and may require us to make costly changes to our operational processes and accounting systems. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers which supersedes nearly all existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance. The new standard became effective for us on January 1, 2018. Although we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the standard on our financial statements or disclosures, it could change the way we account for certain of our revenue transactions. Adoption of the standard could have a significant impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of transactions completed before adoption. See Note 1. Recent Accounting Pronouncements included herein for additional discussion of the accounting changes.. We are dependent on direct sales personnel and third-party distribution channels to achieve revenue growth.. To date, we have sold our products primarily through our direct sales force. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future largely will depend on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient direct sales personnel and establishing and maintaining relationships with distributors, resellers and systems integrators. Our products and services require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at the senior management of our prospective customers. New hires as well as employees of our distributors, resellers and systems integrators require training and may take a significant amount of time before achieving full productivity. Our recent hires may not become as productive as necessary, and we may be unable to hire and retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future. We have entered into strategic alliance agreements with partners, under which partners have agreed to resell and support our current BroadVision product suite. These contracts are generally terminable by either party upon 30 days' notice of an uncured material breach or for convenience upon 90 days' notice prior to the end of any annual term. Termination of any of these alliances could harm our expected revenues. We may be unable to expand our other distribution channels, and any expansion may not result in revenue increases. If we fail to maintain and expand our direct sales force or other distribution channels, our revenues may not grow or they may decline. Revenue generated from third-party distributors in recent years has not been significant.. We may be unable to manage or grow our international operations and assets, which could impair our overall growth or financial position.. We derive a significant portion of our revenue from our operations outside North America. In the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 53% of our revenue was derived from international sales. If we are unable to manage or grow our existing international operations, we may not generate sufficient revenue required to establish and maintain these operations, which could slow our overall growth and impair our operating margins.. As we rely materially on our operations outside of North America, we are subject to significant risks of doing business internationally, including:. <U+FEFF>. • \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tdifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and safeguarding foreign assets; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tunexpected changes in regulatory requirements; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\texport controls relating to encryption technology and other export restrictions; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\ttariffs and other trade barriers; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tpolitical and economic instability; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tfluctuations in currency exchange rates; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\treduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tcultural barriers; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tseasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in Europe and certain other parts of the world; and \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tpotentially adverse tax consequences.. Our international sales growth could be limited if we are unable to establish additional foreign operations, expand international sales channel management and support, hire additional personnel, customize products for local markets and develop relationships with international service providers, distributors and system integrators. Even if we are able to successfully expand our international operations, we may not succeed in maintaining or expanding international market demand for our products.. 10. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. Our success and competitive position will depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology.. Our success and ability to compete are dependent to a significant degree on our proprietary technology. We hold a U.S. patent, issued in March 2017, related to the secure sharing of task data over one or more networks, and another U.S. patent, issued January 2014, on the elements of creating and sharing tasks over one or more networks. We also hold a U.S. patent, issued in January 2004, on elements of the BroadVision platform, which covers mechanisms for translating between a word processing document and an XML file. Although we hold these patents, they may not provide an adequate level of intellectual property protection. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Third parties have claimed and may claim in the future that we have infringed their patent, trademark, copyright or other proprietary rights. Claims may be made for indemnification resulting from allegations of infringement. Intellectual property infringement claims may be asserted against us as a result of the use by third parties of our products. Claims or litigation, with or without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversions of resources, either of which could harm our business.. We also rely on copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services. We have registered \"BroadVision\", \"Clearvale\", \"Interleaf\" and the Clearvale logo as trademarks in the United States and/or in other countries. It is possible that our competitors or other companies will adopt product names similar to these trademarks, impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly confusing customers.. <U+FEFF>. As a matter of company policy, we enter into confidentiality and assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, partners and vendors. We also control access to and distribution of our software, documents and other proprietary information. Notwithstanding these precautions, it may be possible for an unauthorized third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our software or other proprietary information or to develop similar software independently. Policing unauthorized use of our products will be difficult, particularly because the global nature of the Internet makes it difficult to control the ultimate destination or security of software and other transmitted data. The laws of other countries may afford us little or no effective protection of our intellectual property.. A breach of the encryption technology that we use could expose us to liability and harm our reputation, causing a loss of customers.. If any breach of the security technology embedded in our products or hosted Cloud operations were to occur, we would be exposed to liability and our reputation could be harmed, which could cause us to lose customers. A significant barrier to online commerce, portal, social networking and enterprise software is the secure exchange of valuable and confidential information over public networks. We rely on encryption and authentication technology, such as Open SSL, public key cryptography, encryption algorithms RC2 and MD5, digital certificates and HTTPS, to provide the security and authentication necessary to affect the secure exchange of confidential information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, new hacking methods, security holes in 3rd-party components (such as operating system bugs) or other events or developments could cause a breach of the above measures that we use to protect customer data and identity.. The loss or malfunction of technology from third parties could delay the introduction of our products and services.. We rely in part on technology that we license from third parties or we obtain from open sources, including cloud-based solutions from Amazon Web Services; relational database management systems from Oracle; Microsoft and MySQL; J2EE from Oracle and JBoss; and others. The loss or malfunction of any third-party technology could harm our business. We integrate or sublicense third-party technology with internally developed software to perform key functions. For example, our products and services incorporate data encryption and authentication technology from Open SSL. Third-party technology might not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Moreover, third-party technology may contain defects that we cannot control. Problems with third-party technology could cause delays in introducing our products or services until equivalent technology, if available, is identified, licensed or obtained, and integrated. Delays in introducing our products and services could adversely affect our results of operations.. Our use of open source software could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subject us to possible litigation.. <U+FEFF>. We use open source software in our products and may continue to use open source software in the future. We may face claims from others claiming ownership of, or seeking to enforce the terms of, an open source license, including by demanding release of the open source software, derivative works, or our proprietary source code that was developed using such software. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license, or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our platform, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and operating results. In addition, if the license terms for. 11. the open source software we utilize change, we may be forced to reengineer or discontinue our products or incur additional costs. We cannot be certain that we have not incorporated open source software in our products in a manner that is inconsistent with our policies.. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. Our officers, and highly skilled technical and managerial personnel are critical to our business, and they may not remain with us.. Our performance substantially depends on the performance of our management team. We also rely on our ability to retain and motivate qualified personnel, especially our management and highly skilled development teams. The loss of the services of any of our officers or highly skilled technical and managerial personnel, particularly our founder, Chief Executive Officer, President and Interim Chief Financial Officer, Dr. Pehong Chen, could cause us to incur increased operating expenses and divert senior management resources in searching for replacements. Effective as of March 7, 2018, Peter Chu resigned as our Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Strategy and Product Management. In connection with Mr. Chu's resignation, Dr. Chen was appointed as our Interim Chief Financial Officer. As a result of this change, Dr. Chen has taken on substantially more responsibility for the management of our business and of our financial reporting, which has resulted in greater workload demands and could divert his attention away from certain key areas of our business.  Changes in our organization as a result of Mr. Chu's departure may have a disruptive impact on our ability to implement our strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our business, internal controls, financial condition and results of operations. Management transition inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge, which can negatively affect strategy and execution. Until we find and integrate a replacement for Dr. Chu, and unless his replacement is able to succeed in the position, we may be unable to successfully manage and grow our business, and our results of operations, internal controls and financial condition could suffer as a result. The loss of the services of our officers or other personnel also could harm our reputation if our customers were to become concerned about our future operations. We do not carry \"key person\" life insurance policies on any of our employees. Our future success also depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially in the Internet industry. We have in the past experienced, and may continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees. The significant downturn in our business over the past several years has had and may continue to have a negative impact on our operations. We have restructured our operations by reducing our workforce and implementing other cost containment activities. These actions could lead to disruptions in our business, reduced employee morale and productivity, increased attrition, and problems with retaining existing and recruiting future employees.. <U+FEFF>. Limitations on the online collection of profile information could impair the effectiveness of our products.. Online (web or mobile) users' resistance to providing personal data, and laws and regulations prohibiting use of personal data gathered online without express consent or requiring businesses to notify their web site visitors of the possible dissemination of their personal data, could limit the effectiveness of our products. This in turn could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.. One of the principal features of our products is the ability to develop and maintain profiles of online users to assist business managers in determining the nature of the content to be provided to these online users. Typically, profile information is captured when consumers, business customers and employees visit a web site or use applications and volunteer information in response to survey questions or to application forms concerning their backgrounds, interests and preferences. Profiles can be augmented over time through the subsequent collection of usage data. Although our products are designed to enable the development of applications that permit online users to prevent the distribution of any of their personal data beyond that specific web site or application services, privacy concerns may nevertheless cause visitors to resist providing the personal data necessary to support this profiling capability. The mere perception by prospective customers that substantial security and privacy concerns exist among online users, whether or not valid, may indirectly inhibit market acceptance of our products.. In addition, new laws and regulations could heighten privacy concerns by requiring businesses to notify online users that the data captured from them while online may be used by marketing entities to direct product messages to them. We are subject to increasing regulation at the federal and state levels relating to online privacy and the use of personal user information. Several states have proposed legislation that would limit the uses of personal user information gathered online. In addition, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission(the \"FTC\"), has urged Congress to adopt legislation regarding the collection and use of personal identifying information obtained from individuals when accessing web sites. The FTC has settled several proceedings resulting in consent decrees in which Internet companies have been required to establish programs regarding the manner in which personal information is collected from users and provided to third parties. While we adhere to the privacy policies published with our solutions, we could become a party to a similar enforcement proceeding. These regulatory and enforcement efforts could also harm our customers' ability to collect demographic and personal information from users, which could impair the effectiveness of our products.  In addition, the European Union is in the process of proposing reforms to its existing data protection legal framework, which may result in a greater compliance burden for companies with customers in Europe.. 12. We may not have adequate back-up systems, and natural or manmade disasters could damage our operations, reduce our revenue and lead to a loss of customers.. We may not have adequate back-up and redundant systems for both customer-used service and internal information technology. A natural or manmade disaster could severely harm our business because our service and operation could be interrupted for an indeterminate length of time. Our operations depend upon our ability to maintain and protect our computer systems at our facility in Redwood City, California, which reside on or near known earthquake fault zones. These systems are vulnerable to damage from fire, floods, earthquakes, power loss, acts of terrorism, telecommunications failures and similar events. We also have significantly reduced our workforce since 2000, which has placed different requirements on our systems and has caused us to lose personnel knowledgeable about our systems, both of which could make it more difficult to quickly resolve system disruptions. Disruptions in our internal business operations could harm our business by resulting in delays, disruption of our customers' business, loss of data, and loss of customer confidence.. We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk.. A total of 53% and 54% of our fiscal year 2017 and 2016 revenues, respectively, were derived from international operations for which we transact business in foreign currencies. International revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in U.S. Dollars as the U.S. Dollar weakens or strengthens against such other currencies. Substantially all of the revenues of our international operations are received, and substantially all expenses are incurred, in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, which increases or decreases the related U.S. Dollar-reported revenues and expenses depending on the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These fluctuations could cause our revenues outside the United States and other results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors. Additionally, such foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could make it more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations. In addition, a total of 17% of our cash and cash equivalents as well as investments were denominated in foreign currencies as of December 31, 2017. Accordingly, changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can affect our operating results due to transactional and translational re-measurements that are reflected in our results of operations. To the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. We do not engage in any hedging activities in order to manage any potential adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can address these risks.. <U+FEFF>. Our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders.. <U+FEFF>. The actions of activist stockholders could adversely affect our business. Specifically, responding to common actions of an activist stockholder, including without limitation public proposals, requests to pursue a strategic combination or other transaction or other special requests, could disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming or divert the attention of our management and employees.  In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction in relation to the actions of an activist stockholder may result in the loss of potential business opportunities or the perception that we are unstable as a company, which may be exploited by our competitors and make it more difficult to attract and retain personnel as well as consumers and service providers.  Actions of an activist stockholder may also cause fluctuations in our stock price based on speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.. <U+FEFF>. Weakened global economic conditions or tariffs and other trade restrictions may harm our industry, business, and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. We derive revenue from clients in many countries, and our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. Global financial developments and downturns seemingly unrelated to us, our products or our industry may harm us. The United States and other key international economies have been impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies, and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. The revenue growth and potential profitability of our business depends on demand for our products generally. Historically, during economic downturns there have been reductions in spending on technology systems as well as pressure for extended billing terms and other financial concessions, which would negatively affect our operating results. These conditions affect the rate of technology spending and could adversely affect our customers' ability or willingness to purchase our products, delay prospective customers' purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions, or affect renewal rates, all of which could harm our operating results.. <U+FEFF>. Additionally, the new U.S. presidential administration has called for substantial changes to foreign trade policy and has raised the possibility of imposing significant increases in tariffs on international trade. We also rely on various U.S. corporate tax provisions related to international commerce. If we are subject to new regulations, or if restrictions and tariffs increase our operating costs in the future, and we are not able to recapture those costs from our customers, or if such initiatives regulations, restrictions and tariffs make it more difficult for us to compete in overseas markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.. 13. Risks related to BroadVision common stock. <U+FEFF>. One stockholder beneficially owns a substantial portion of the outstanding BroadVision common stock, and as a result exerts substantial control over us.. <U+FEFF>. As of December 31, 2017, Dr. Pehong Chen, our Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, beneficially owned approximately 1.6 million shares of our common stock, which represents approximately 33% of the outstanding common stock as of such date. As a result, Dr. Chen exerts substantial control over all matters coming to a vote of our stockholders, including with respect to:. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. • \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tthe composition of our board of directors and, through it, any determination with respect to our business direction and policies, including the appointment and removal of officers;  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tany determinations with respect to mergers and other business combinations;  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tour acquisition or disposition of assets;  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tour financing activities; and  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tthe payment of dividends on our capital stock.. This control by Dr. Chen could depress the market price of our common stock or delay or prevent a change in control of BroadVision.. <U+FEFF>. We recently transferred the listing of our common stock from the NASDAQ Global Market to the NASDAQ Capital Market. If we fail to maintain the requirements for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock could be delisted from trading, which would adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital.. <U+FEFF>. In November 2017, we transferred the listing of our common stock from the NASDAQ Global Market to the NASDAQ Capital Market as our stockholders' equity had decreased from $12.1 million at June 30, 2017 to $9.7 million at September 30, 2017. We are required to meet specified listing criteria in order to maintain our listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market. If we fail to satisfy the NASDAQ Capital Market's continued listing requirements, our common stock could be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market, in which case we may be able to transfer to the over-the-counter bulletin board. For example, NASDAQ Rule 5550(b)(1) requires companies listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market to maintain a minimum of $2.5 million in stockholders' equity for continued listing. If our stockholders' equity falls below $2.5 million, the NASDAQ Capital Market may take formal action and determine that we are no longer suitable for listing and may commence delisting procedures. Any potential delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ Capital Market would make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell our stock in the public market and would likely result in decreased liquidity and increased volatility for our common stock.. Our stock price has been highly volatile.. The high and low price of BroadVision common stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market ranged from $2.66 per share to $8.06 per share between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017. Our stock price is subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including:. <U+FEFF>. • \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tquarterly variations in operating results; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tannouncements of technological innovations; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tannouncements of new software or services by us or our competitors; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tlow trading volume on the NASDAQ Stock Market; \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tgeneral economic conditions; or \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t• \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tother events or factors that are beyond our control.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the trading prices of equity securities of many technology companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Any negative change in the public's perception of the prospects of Internet, enterprise social networking or electronic commerce companies could further depress our stock price regardless of our results.
