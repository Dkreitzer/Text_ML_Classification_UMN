[1] "Item 1A.    Risk Factors.. Set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.  The risks set forth below are not the only risks faced by the Company.  The Company's business operations could also be affected by other factors not presently known to the Company or factors that the Company currently does not consider to be material.. Negative economic conditions may adversely impact demand for the Company's products and services, as well as the ability of the Company's customers to meet their obligations to the Company on a timely basis.. Negative economic conditions, including the tightening of credit in financial markets, can lead businesses to postpone spending, which may impact the Company's customers, causing them to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders with the Company.  In addition, economic conditions may further impact the ability of the Company's customers by either causing them to close locations serviced by the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, or cause their financial condition to deteriorate to a point where they are unable to meet their obligations to the Company on a timely basis.  One or more of these events could adversely impact the Company's operating results and realizability of receivables.. 5. Table of Contents. Cyclical industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the Company's businesses.. The Company's businesses are subject to general economic slowdowns and cyclical conditions in each of the industries served.  In particular:. • The Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment may be adversely impacted by prolonged slowdowns in steel mill production, excess production capacity, bankruptcy or receivership of steel producers and changes in outsourcing practices in the steel industry;. • The resource recovery technologies business of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment can also be adversely impacted by prolonged slowdowns in customer production or a reduction in the selling prices of its materials, which are market-based and vary based upon the current fair value of the components being sold.  Therefore, the revenue generated from the sale of such recycled materials varies based upon the fair value of the commodity components being sold;. • The industrial abrasives and roofing granules business of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment may be adversely impacted by reduced home resales or economic conditions that slow the rate of residential roof replacement, or by slowdowns in the industrial and infrastructure refurbishment industries;. • Decreasing oil prices may adversely impact purchasing by energy sector customers in the Harsco Industrial Segment;. • The industrial grating products business of the Harsco Industrial Segment may be adversely impacted by slowdowns in non-residential construction and industrial production;. • The Harsco Rail Segment may be adversely impacted by developments in the railroad industry that lead to lower capital spending or reduced track maintenance spending; and. • Capital constraints and increased borrowing costs may also adversely impact the financial position and operations of the Company's customers across all business segments.. Furthermore, realization of deferred tax assets is ultimately dependent on generating sufficient income in future periods to ensure recovery of those assets.  The cyclicality of the Company's end markets and adverse economic conditions may negatively impact the future income levels that are necessary for the utilization of deferred tax assets.. The seasonality of the Company's business may cause quarterly results to fluctuate.. The Company has historically generated the majority of its cash flows provided by operations in the second half of the year.  This is a result of normally higher income during the second half of the year, as the Company's business tends to follow seasonal patterns.  If the Company is unable to successfully manage the cash flow and other effects of seasonality on the business, its results of operations may suffer.. Increased customer concentration and related credit and commercial risks may adversely impact the Company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company's top five customers in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment accounted for approximately 31% of revenues in that Segment and 20% of the Company's total revenues.. Certain of the several large customers in the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment have significant accounts receivable balances.  If a large customer were to experience financial difficulty or file for bankruptcy or receivership protection, it could adversely impact the Company's results of operations, cash flows and asset valuations.. Disputes with the Company's largest customers, or customers with long-term contracts, could adversely affect the Company's financial condition.. The Company routinely enters into multiple contracts with customers, many of which can be long-term contracts.  For example, the Company is currently party to multiple contracts in numerous countries with its largest customer, ArcelorMittal, which accounted for approximately 9% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017.  These contracts cover a variety of services and vary in contract length.  From time to time, the Company may be negotiating the terms of current and potential future services to be rendered due to the scope and complexity of this relationship.  Disagreements between the parties can arise as a result of the scope and nature of the relationship and these ongoing negotiations.. In addition, under long-term contracts, the Company may incur capital expenditures or other costs at the beginning of the contract that it expects to recoup through the life of the contract.  Some of these contracts provide for advance payments to assist the Company in covering these costs and expenses.  A dispute with a customer during the life of a long-term contract could impact the ability of the Company to receive these advance payments or otherwise recoup incurred costs and expenses.. 6. Table of Contents. The Company's global presence subjects it to a variety of risks arising from doing business internationally.. The Company operates in approximately 30 countries, generating 57% of its revenues outside of the U.S. (based on location of the facility generating the revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2017.  In addition, as of December 31, 2017, approximately 75% of the Company's property, plant and equipment are located outside of the U.S.  The Company's global footprint exposes it to a variety of risks that may adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.  These include, but may not be limited to, the following:. •periodic economic downturns in the countries in which the Company does business;. • imposition of or increases in currency exchange controls and hard currency shortages;. • customs matters and changes in trade policy or tariff regulations;. • changes in regulatory requirements in the countries in which the Company does business;. • changes in tax regulations, higher tax rates in certain jurisdictions and potentially adverse tax consequences including restrictions on repatriating earnings, adverse tax withholding requirements and \"double taxation;\". • longer payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;. • complexities in complying with a variety of U.S. and foreign government laws, controls and regulations;. • political, economic and social instability, civil and political unrest, terrorist actions and armed hostilities in the regions or countries in which the Company does business;. • increasing complex laws and regulations concerning privacy and data security, including the European Union's (\"EU\") General Data Protection Regulation;. • inflation rates in the countries in which the Company does business;. • complying with complex labor laws in foreign jurisdictions;. • laws in various international jurisdictions that limit the right and ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends and remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met;. • sovereign risk related to international governments, including, but may not be limited to, governments stopping interest payments or repudiating their debt, nationalizing private businesses or altering foreign exchange regulations; and. • uncertainties arising from local business practices, cultural considerations and international political and trade tensions.. The Company has operations in several countries in the Middle East, including Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Oman, as well as India, some of which have experienced armed hostilities and civil unrest.  Additionally, these countries are geographically close to other countries that may have a continued high risk of armed hostilities or civil unrest.. If the Company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with its global business, the Company's results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows may be negatively impacted.. Due to the international nature of the Company's business, the Company could be adversely affected by violations of certain laws.. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  The FCPA also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which, among other things, are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of \"off the books\" slush funds from which improper payments can be made.  The Company may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by employees or agents and may be exposed to liability due to pre-acquisition conduct of employees or agents of businesses or operations the Company may acquire.  Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt the Company's operations, require significant management involvement and have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  If the Company is found to be liable for violations of these laws (either due to its own acts, out of inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), the Company could also be subject to severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions; disgorgement; further changes or enhancements to its procedures, policies and controls; personnel changes and other remedial actions.. Furthermore, the Company is subject to the export controls and economic embargo rules and regulations of the U.S., including the Export Administration Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Control within the Department of Treasury, as well as other laws and regulations administered by the Department of Commerce.  These regulations limit the Company's ability to market, sell, distribute or otherwise transfer its products to prohibited countries or persons.  Failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines and disgorgement of profits, the imposition of a court-appointed monitor, the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in U.S. Government contracts.. 7. Table of Contents. Exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact the Company's business.. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the approximately 25 other currencies in which the Company currently conducts business may adversely impact the Company's results of operations in any given fiscal period.  The Company's principal foreign currency exposures are in the EU, the U.K. and Brazil.  Given the structure of the Company's operations, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which the Company earns its revenues generally has a negative impact on the translated amounts of the assets and liabilities, results of operations and cash flows.  The Company's foreign currency exposures increase the risk of volatility in its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  If currencies in the below regions change materially in relation to the U.S. dollar, the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows may be materially affected.. Compared with the corresponding full-year period in 2016, the average value of major currencies changed as follows in relation to the U.S. dollar during the full-year 2017, impacting the Company's revenues and income:. • British pound sterling weakened by 4%. • euro strengthened  by  3%. • Brazilian real strengthened by 8%. Compared with exchange rates at December 31, 2016, the value of major currencies at December 31, 2017 changed as follows:. • British pound sterling strengthened by 9%. • euro strengthened by 14%. • Brazilian real weakened by 2%. To illustrate the effect of foreign exchange rate changes in certain key markets of the Company, in 2017 revenues would have been less than 1% or $8 million lower and operating income would have been approximately less than 1% or less than            $1 million higher if the average exchange rates for 2016 were utilized.  In a similar comparison for 2016, revenues would have been approximately 4% or $51 million higher and operating income would have been approximately 5% or $3 million lower if the average exchange rates for 2015 were utilized.. Currency changes also result in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into U.S. dollars at different amounts than at the prior period end.  Generally, if the U.S. dollar weakens in relation to currencies in countries in which the Company does business, the translated amounts of the related assets, liabilities, and therefore stockholders' equity, would increase.  Conversely, if the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to currencies in countries in which the Company does business, the translated amounts of the related assets, liabilities, and therefore stockholders' equity, would decrease.. Although the Company engages in foreign currency exchange forward contracts and other hedging strategies to mitigate foreign exchange transactional risks, hedging strategies may not be successful or may fail to completely offset these risks.  In addition, competitive conditions in the Company's manufacturing businesses may limit the Company's ability to increase product prices in the face of adverse currency movement.  Sales of products manufactured in the U.S. for the domestic and export markets may be affected by the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies.  Any long-term strengthening of the U.S. dollar could depress demand for these products and reduce sales.  Conversely, any long-term weakening of the U.S. dollar could improve demand for these products and increase sales.. Economic conditions and regulatory changes following the United Kingdom's referendum on withdrawal from the EU could impact on the Company's business and results of operations.. In June 2016, a majority of voters in the U.K. approved a withdrawal from the EU in a national referendum (often referred to as Brexit). In March 2017 the U.K. invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, initiating the withdrawal process, and the U.K. is scheduled to depart from the EU on March 29, 2019.  The U.K. and the EU are negotiating their future relationship, including whether there will be a transition period.  The scheduled withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU, including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal.. The Company's business, particularly the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment, whose headquarters is in the U.K., could be adversely impacted by the likely exit of the U.K. from the EU.  Adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions and volatility in currency exchange rates could have a negative impact on the Company's operations, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, incremental regulatory controls and regulations governing trade between the U.K. and the rest of the EU could have adverse consequences on the steel industry in the U.K. and/or the EU, and could negatively impact the Company's operations and financial condition.. 8. Table of Contents. The Company may lose customers or be required to reduce prices as a result of competition.. The industries in which the Company operates are highly competitive:. • The Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment is sustained mainly through contract renewals and new contract signings.  The Company may be unable to renew contracts at historical price levels or to obtain additional contracts at historical rates as a result of competition.  If the Company is unable to renew its contracts at the historical rates or renewals are made at reduced prices, or if its customers terminate their contracts, revenue and results of operations may decline.. • The Harsco Industrial and Harsco Rail Segments compete with companies that manufacture similar products both internationally and domestically.  Certain international competitors export their products into the U.S. and sell them at lower prices, which can be the result of lower labor costs and government subsidies for exports.  In addition, certain competitors may from time to time sell their products below their cost of production in an attempt to increase their market share.  Such practices may limit the prices the Company can charge for its products and services.  Unfavorable foreign exchange rates can also adversely impact the Company's ability to match the prices charged by international competitors.  If the Company is unable to match the prices charged by competitors, it may lose customers.. Restrictions imposed by the Company's credit facility and other financing arrangements may limit the Company's operating and financial flexibility.. The agreements governing the Company's outstanding financing arrangements impose a number of restrictions.  Under the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facility, the Company must comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis.  The covenants also place limitations on dividends, acquisitions, investments in joint ventures, unrestricted subsidiaries, indebtedness and the imposition of liens on the Company's assets.  In the event of a default, the Company's lenders and the counterparties to the Company's other financing arrangements could terminate their commitments to the Company and declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued interests and fees, immediately due and payable.  If this were to occur, the Company might not be able to pay these amounts, or the Company might be forced to seek an amendment to the Company's financing arrangements which could make the terms of these arrangements more onerous for the Company.  In addition, this could also trigger an event of default under the cross-default provisions of the Company's other obligations.  As a result, a default under one or more of the existing or future financing arrangements could have significant consequences for the Company.. The Company is exposed to counterparty risk in its derivative financial arrangements.. The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange forward contracts, for a variety of purposes.  The Company uses interest rate swaps in conjunction with certain debt issuances in order to secure either a fixed or floating interest rate.  The Company uses foreign currency exchange forward contracts as part of a worldwide program to minimize foreign currency operating income and balance sheet exposure.  In particular, the Company uses foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge commitments, such as foreign currency debt, firm purchase commitments and foreign currency cash flows for certain export sales transactions.  The unsecured contracts for foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2017 mature at various times through 2018 and are with major financial institutions.  The Company may also enter into derivative contracts to hedge commodity exposures.. The failure of one or more counterparties to the Company's derivative financial instruments to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.. The Company's variable rate indebtedness subjects it to interest rate risk, which could cause the Company's debt service obligations to increase significantly.. The Company's total debt at December 31, 2017 was $586.6 million.  Of this amount, approximately 99% had variable rates of interest and 1% had fixed rates of interest.  The weighted average interest rate of total debt was approximately 4.8%.  At debt levels as of December 31, 2017, a one percentage point increase in variable interest rates would increase interest expense by   $6 million per year.  If the Company is unable to successfully manage its exposure to variable interest rates, including through interest rates swaps that the Company has put into place, its debt service obligations may increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and in turn, its results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted.. Additionally, whenever the Company refinances fixed rate debt, the new interest rates may negatively impact the Company's results of operations.  The interest rates associated with new fixed rate debt are impacted by several factors including, but not limited to, market conditions, term of the borrowings and the financial results and currency.. 9. Table of Contents. The Company is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions.  Legislative, regulatory and legal developments involving income taxes could materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations and cash flows and impact the Company's ability to compete abroad.. The Company is subject to U.S. federal, U.S. state and international income, payroll, property, sales and use, value-added, fuel and other types of taxes in numerous jurisdictions.  Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's worldwide provisions for income taxes.  Changes in tax rates, enactments of new tax laws, revisions of tax regulations, and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in substantially higher taxes, and therefore, could have a significant adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.. Recently enacted tax reform legislation has made substantial changes to U.S. tax law, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate, a limitation on deductibility of interest expense, a limitation on the use of net operating losses to offset future taxable income, the allowance of immediate expensing of capital expenditures, deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings and the change from a worldwide tax system to territorial.  The Company expects this legislation to have significant effects on the Company, some of which may be adverse.  For example, the reduction in the corporate tax rate is expected to result in a reduction in the value of the Company's existing deferred tax assets and consequently a noncash charge to the Company's earnings.  While the Company recorded a provisional charge of $48.7 million in 2017, the magnitude of the net impact remains uncertain at this time and is subject to any other regulatory or administrative developments, including any regulations or other guidance promulgated by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service as well as state governments.. The Company's defined benefit net periodic pension cost (\"NPPC\") is directly affected by the equity and bond markets.  A downward trend in those markets could adversely impact the Company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. In addition to the economic issues that directly affect the Company's businesses, changes in the performance of equity and bond markets, particularly in the U.K. and the U.S., impact actuarial assumptions used in determining annual NPPC, pension liabilities and the valuation of the assets in the Company's defined benefit pension plans.  Financial market deterioration would most likely have a negative impact on the Company's NPPC and the pension assets and liabilities.  This could result in a decrease to stockholders' equity and an increase in the Company's statutory funding requirements.. In addition to the Company's defined benefit pension plans, the Company also participates in several multiemployer pension plans (\"MEPPs\") throughout the world.  Within the U.S., the Pension Protection Act of 2006 may require additional funding for MEPPs that could cause the Company to be subject to higher cash contributions in the future.  Additionally, market conditions and the number of participating employers remaining in each plan may affect the funded status of MEPPs and consequently, any Company withdrawal liability, if applicable.. A negative outcome on personal injury claims against the Company may adversely impact results of operations and financial condition.. The Company has been named as one of many defendants (approximately 90 or more in most cases) in legal actions alleging personal injury from exposure to airborne asbestos over the past several decades.  In their suits, the plaintiffs have named as defendants, among others, many manufacturers, distributors and installers of numerous types of equipment or products that allegedly contained asbestos.  The majority of the asbestos complaints pending against the Company have been filed in New York.  Almost all of the New York complaints contain a standard claim for damages of $20 million or $25 million against the approximately 90 defendants, regardless of the individual plaintiff's alleged medical condition and without specifically identifying any of the Company's products as the source of plaintiff's asbestos exposure.  If the Company is found to be liable in any of these actions and the liability exceeds the Company's insurance coverage, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.. The nature of the Company's products creates the possibility of significant product liability and warranty claims, which could harm its business.. The Company's customers use some of its products in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property, equipment or the environment.  In addition, the Company's products are integral to the production process for some end-users and any failure of the Company's products could result in a suspension of operations.  Accidents may occur at a location where the Company's equipment and services have been or are being used.  Investigations into such accidents, even if the Company and its products are ultimately found not to be the cause of such accidents, require the Company to expend significant time, effort and resources.  The Company cannot be certain that its products will be completely free from defects.  The Company may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims.  In addition, the Company cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or adequate to cover any or all liabilities incurred.  The Company also may not be able to maintain insurance in the future at levels it believes are necessary and at rates it considers reasonable.. 10. Table of Contents. Higher than expected claims under insurance policies, under which the Company retains a portion of the risk, could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows.. The Company retains a significant portion of the risk for property, workers' compensation, U.K. employers' liability, automobile and general and product liability losses.  Reserves have been recorded that reflect the undiscounted estimated liabilities for ultimate losses, including claims incurred but not reported.  Inherent in these estimates are assumptions that are based on the Company's history of claims and losses, a detailed analysis of existing claims with respect to potential value, and current legal and legislative trends.  If actual claims are higher than those projected by management, an increase to the Company's insurance reserves may be required and would be recorded as a charge to income in the period the need for the change was determined.. Increases or decreases in purchase prices (or selling prices) or availability of steel or other materials and commodities may affect the Company's profitability.. The profitability of the Company's manufactured products is affected by changing purchase prices of raw material, including steel and other materials and commodities.  If raw material costs associated with the Company's manufactured products increase and the costs cannot be transferred to the Company's customers, results of operations would be adversely affected.  Additionally, decreased availability of steel or other materials could affect the Company's ability to produce manufactured products in a timely manner.  If the Company cannot obtain the necessary raw materials for its manufactured products, then revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.. Certain services performed by the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment result in the recovery, processing and sale of recovered metals and minerals and other high-value metal by-products to its customers.  The selling price of the by-products material is market-based and varies based upon the current fair value of its components.  Therefore, the revenue amounts generated from the sale of such by-products material vary based upon the fair value of the commodity components being sold.. The success of the Company's strategic ventures depends on the satisfactory performance by strategic venture partners of their strategic venture obligations.. The Company enters into various strategic ventures as part of its strategic growth initiatives as well as to comply with local laws.  Differences in opinions or views between strategic venture partners can result in delayed decision-making or failure to agree on material issues which could adversely affect the business and operations of the venture.  From time to time, in order to establish or preserve a relationship, or to better ensure venture success, the Company may accept risks or responsibilities for the strategic venture that are not necessarily proportionate with the reward it expects to receive.  The success of these and other strategic ventures also depends, in large part, on the satisfactory performance by the Company's strategic venture partners of their strategic venture obligations, including their obligation to commit working capital, equity or credit support as required by the strategic venture and to support their indemnification and other contractual obligations.. If the Company's strategic venture partners fail to satisfactorily perform their strategic venture obligations as a result of financial or other difficulties, the strategic venture may be unable to adequately perform or deliver its contracted services.  Under these circumstances, the Company may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services.  These additional obligations could result in reduced profits or, in some cases, increased liabilities or significant losses for the Company with respect to the strategic venture.  In addition, although the Company generally performs due diligence with regard to potential strategic partners or ventures, a failure by a strategic venture partner to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations could negatively impact its business and, in the case of government contracts, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment.  Unexpected strategic venture developments could have a material adverse effect on results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. The Company is subject to various environmental laws, and the success of existing or future environmental claims against it could adversely impact the Company's results of operations and cash flows.. The Company's operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of health, safety and the environment, including those governing discharges to air and water, handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes, the remediation of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace.  These laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or exposure to, hazardous materials.  The Company could incur substantial costs as a result of non-compliance with or liability for remediation or other costs or damages under these laws.  The Company may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future, and compliance with more stringent environmental requirements may require the Company to make material expenditures or subject it to liabilities that the Company currently does not anticipate.. 11. Table of Contents. The Company is currently involved in a number of environmental remediation investigations and cleanups and, along with other companies, has been identified as a \"potentially responsible party\" for certain waste disposal sites under the federal \"Superfund\" law.  At several sites, the Company is currently conducting environmental remediation, and it is probable that the Company will agree to make payments toward funding certain other of these remediation activities.  It also is possible that some of these matters will be decided unfavorably to the Company and that other sites requiring remediation will be identified.  Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and financial exposure is dependent upon such factors as:. • the continuing evolution of environmental laws and regulatory requirements;. • the availability and application of technology;. • the allocation of cost among potentially responsible parties;. • the years of remedial activity required; and. • the remediation methods selected.. The Company's ongoing operations are subject to extensive laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, health and environmental matters that impose significant costs and liabilities on the Company, and future laws and governmental standards could increase these costs and liabilities.. The Company is subject to a variety of international, federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations, rules and ordinances regulating the use of certain materials contained in its products and/or used in its manufacturing processes.  Many of these laws and governmental standards provide for extensive obligations that require the Company to incur significant compliance costs, and impose substantial monetary fines and/or criminal sanctions for violations.. Furthermore, such laws and standards are subject to change and may become more stringent.  Although it is not possible to predict changes in laws or other governmental standards, the development, proposal or adoption of more stringent laws or governmental standards may require the Company to change its manufacturing processes, for example, by reducing or eliminating use of the regulated component or material in its manufacturing process.  The Company may not be able to develop a new manufacturing process to comply with such legal and regulatory changes without investing significant time and resources, if at all.  In addition, such legal and regulatory changes may also affect buying decisions by the users of the Company's products that contain regulated materials or that involve the use of such materials in the manufacturing process.  If applicable laws and governmental standards become more stringent, the Company's results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.. The Company maintains a workforce based upon current and anticipated workload.  If the Company does not receive future contract awards or if these awards are delayed, significant cost may result that could have a material adverse effect on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.. The Company's estimates of future performance depend on, among other matters, whether and when the Company will receive certain new contract awards, including the extent to which the Company utilizes its workforce.  The rate at which the Company utilizes its workforce is impacted by a variety of factors, including:. • the ability to manage attrition;. • the ability to forecast the need for services, which allows the Company to maintain an appropriately sized workforce;. • the ability to transition employees from completed projects to new projects or between segments; and. • the need to devote resources to non-revenue generating activities such as training or business development.. While the Company's estimates are based upon good faith judgment, these estimates can be unreliable and may frequently change based on newly available information.  In the case of large-scale domestic and international projects where timing is often uncertain, it is particularly difficult to predict whether and when the Company will receive a contract award.  The uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching the Company's workforce size with contract needs.  If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, the Company could incur cost resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities or equipment that could have a material adverse effect on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.. Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to the Company's systems, networks, products and services.. The Company relies upon information technology systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities, some of which are managed by third parties.  Additionally, the Company collects and stores data that is of a sensitive nature.  The secure operation of these information technology systems and networks, and the processing and maintenance of this data is critical to the Company's business operations and strategy.  Information technology security threats - from user error to attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to the Company's systems, networks and data - are increasing in frequency and sophistication.  Attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats.  These threats pose a risk to the security of the Company's systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the Company's data.  Should an attack on the Company's information technology systems and networks succeed, it could expose the Company and the Company's employees, customers, dealers and suppliers. 12. Table of Contents. to misuse of information or systems, the compromising of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, production downtimes and operations disruptions.  The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect the Company's reputation, competitive position, business, results of operations and cash flows.  In addition, such breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action, potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures.. The Company's intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitors from independently developing similar or duplicative products and services.. The Company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling similar or duplicative products and services, and there can be no assurance that the resources invested by the Company to protect the Company's intellectual property will be sufficient or that the Company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the Company's technology.  The Company could also face competition in some countries where the Company has not invested in an intellectual property portfolio.  The Company may also face attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Company's information technology systems or products for the purpose of improperly acquiring trade secrets or confidential business information.  The theft or unauthorized use or publication of the Company's trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect the Company's competitive position and the value of the Company's investment in research and development.  The Company may be unable to secure or retain ownership or rights to use data in certain software analytics or services offerings.  In addition, the Company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities.  Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming.  If the Company is found to infringe any third-party rights, the Company could be required to pay substantial damages or could be enjoined from offering some of the Company's products and services.  Also, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to obtain or renew from third parties the licenses needed in the future, and there is no assurance that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms.. Union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results.. A significant portion of the Company's employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates.  There can be no assurance that any current or future issues with the Company's employees will be resolved or that the Company will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or the Company's employees.  The Company may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. and other countries when they expire.  If the Company fails to renegotiate existing collective bargaining agreements, the Company could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions.  In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at the Company's facilities in the future.  The Company may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to the Company's business or collective bargaining agreements.  A work stoppage or other limitations on production at the Company's facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  In addition, many of the Company's customers and suppliers have unionized work forces.  Strikes or work stoppages experienced by the Company's customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.. If the Company cannot generate future cash flows at a level sufficient to recover the net book value of any reporting units, the Company may be required to record an impairment charge to earnings.. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $401.8 million of goodwill.  In connection with the Company's goodwill impairment testing, the Company may be required to record future impairment charges to the extent it cannot generate future cash flows at a level sufficient to recover the net book value of any of the Company's reporting units.  The Company's estimates of fair value are based on assumptions about the future operating cash flows and growth rates of each reporting unit and discount rates applied to these cash flows.  Based on the uncertainty of future growth rates and other assumptions used to estimate goodwill recoverability, future reductions in the Company's expected cash flows could cause a material non-cash goodwill impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition."
