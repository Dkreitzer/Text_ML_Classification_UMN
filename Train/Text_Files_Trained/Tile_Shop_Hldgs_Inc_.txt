[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. <U+FEFF>. The following are significant factors known to us that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements made by us are qualified by the risks described below. There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.. <U+FEFF>. Our business, financial condition and operating results are dependent on general economic conditions and discretionary spending by our customers, which in turn are also affected by a variety of factors beyond our control. If such conditions deteriorate, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. Our business, financial condition and operating results are affected by general economic conditions and discretionary spending by our customers. Such general economic conditions and discretionary spending are beyond our control and are affected by, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe housing market, including housing turnover and home values;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconsumer confidence in the economy;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunemployment trends;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconsumer debt levels;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconsumer credit availability;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdata security and privacy concerns;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenergy prices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinterest rates and inflation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trates of growth in real disposable personal income;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnatural disasters and unpredictable weather;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttrade relations and tariffs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttax rates and tax policy; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother matters that influence consumer confidence and spending.. 5. Table Of Contents. If such conditions deteriorate, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected. In addition, increasing volatility in financial and capital markets may cause some of the above factors to change with a greater degree of frequency and magnitude than in the past.. Our ability to grow and remain profitable may be limited by direct or indirect competition in the highly-competitive retail tile industry.. <U+FEFF>. The retail tile industry in the United States is highly competitive. Participants in the tile industry compete primarily based on product variety, customer service, store location, and price. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete favorably with our competitors in these areas. Our store competitors include large national home centers, regional and local specialty retailers of tile, factory direct stores, privately-owned, single-site stores and online-only competitors. We also compete indirectly with companies that sell other types of floor coverings, including wood floors, carpet, and vinyl sheet. In the past, we have faced periods of heightened competition that materially affected our results of operations. Certain of our competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more varied product offerings, and substantially greater financial and other resources than us. Accordingly, we may face periods of intense competition in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our planned growth and future results of operations. Moreover, the barriers to entry into the retail tile industry are relatively low. New or existing retailers could enter our markets and increase the competition that we face. In addition, manufacturers and suppliers of tile and related products, including those whose products we currently sell, could enter the United States retail tile market and start directly competing with us. Competition in existing and new markets may also prevent or delay our ability to gain relative market share. Any of the developments described above could have a material adverse effect on our planned growth and future results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. If we fail to successfully manage the challenges that our planned growth poses or encounter unexpected difficulties during our expansion, our revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. One of our long-term objectives is to increase revenue and profitability through market share gains. Our ability to achieve market share growth, however, is contingent upon our ability to open new stores and achieve operating results in new stores at the same level as our similarly situated current stores. We anticipate opening three stores in fiscal year 2018. There can be no assurance that we will be able to open stores in new markets at the rate required to achieve market leadership in such markets, identify and obtain favorable store sites, arrange favorable leases for stores, obtain governmental and other third-party consents, permits, and licenses needed to open or operate stores in a timely manner, train and hire a sufficient number of qualified managers for new stores, attract a strong customer base and brand familiarity in new markets, or successfully compete with established retail tile stores in the new markets that we enter. Failure to open new stores in an effective and cost-efficient manner could place us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to retailers who are more adept than us at managing these challenges, which, in turn, could negatively affect our overall operating results.. <U+FEFF>. Our same store sales fluctuate due to a variety of economic, operating, industry and environmental factors and may not be a fair indicator of our overall performance.. <U+FEFF>. Our same store sales have experienced fluctuations, which can be expected to continue. Numerous factors affect our same store sales results, including among others, the timing of new and relocated store openings, the relative proportion of new and relocated stores to mature stores, cannibalization resulting from the opening of new stores in existing markets, changes in advertising and other operating costs, the timing and level of markdowns, changes in our product mix, weather conditions, retail trends, the retail sales environment, economic conditions, inflation, the impact of competition, and our ability to execute our business strategy. As a result, same store sales or operating results may fluctuate and may cause the price of our securities to fluctuate significantly. Therefore, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our same store sales may not be a reliable indicator of our future overall operating performance.. <U+FEFF>. We intend to open additional stores in both our existing markets and new markets, which poses both the possibility of diminishing sales by existing stores in our existing markets and the risk of a slow ramp-up period for stores in new markets.. <U+FEFF>. Our expansion strategy includes plans to open three additional stores in existing markets during 2018.  In future periods, we intend to continue opening stores in new and existing markets. Because our stores typically draw customers from their local areas, additional stores may draw customers away from nearby existing stores and may cause same store sales performance at those existing stores to decline, which may adversely affect our overall operating results. Additionally, stores in new markets typically have a ramp-up period before sales become steady enough for such stores to be profitable. Our ability to open additional stores will be dependent on our ability to promote and/or recruit enough qualified store managers, assistant store managers, and sales associates. The time and effort required to train and supervise a large number of new managers and associates and integrate them into our culture may divert resources from our existing stores. If we are unable to profitably open additional stores in both new and existing markets and limit the adverse impact of those new stores on existing stores, it may reduce our same store sales and overall operating results during the implementation of our expansion strategy.. <U+FEFF>. 6. Table Of Contents. Our expansion strategy will be dependent upon, and limited by, the availability of adequate capital.. <U+FEFF>. Our expansion strategy will require adequate capital for, among other purposes, opening new stores, distribution centers, and manufacturing facilities, as well as entering new markets. Such expenditures will include researching real estate and consumer markets, leases, inventory, property and equipment costs, integration of new stores and markets into company-wide systems and programs, and other costs associated with new stores and market entry expenses and growth. If cash generated internally is insufficient to fund capital requirements, we will require additional debt or equity financing. Adequate financing may not be available or, if available, may not be available on terms satisfactory to us. In addition, our credit facility may limit the amount of capital expenditures that we may make annually, depending on our leverage ratio. If we fail to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future or we are unable to make capital expenditures under our credit facility, we could be forced to curtail our expansion strategies by reducing or delaying capital expenditures relating to new stores and new market entry. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to fund our current plans for the opening of new stores or entry into new markets.. <U+FEFF>. If we fail to identify and maintain relationships with a sufficient number of suppliers, our ability to obtain products that meet our high quality standards at attractive prices could be adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. We purchase flooring and other products directly from suppliers located around the world. However, we do not have long-term contractual supply agreements with our suppliers that obligate them to supply us with products exclusively or at specified quantities or prices. As a result, our current suppliers may decide to sell products to our competitors and may not continue selling products to us. In order to retain the competitive advantage that we believe results from these relationships, we need to continue to identify, develop and maintain relationships with qualified suppliers that can satisfy our high standards for quality and our requirements for flooring and other products in a timely and efficient manner at attractive prices. The need to develop new relationships will be particularly important as we seek to expand our operations and enhance our product offerings in the future. The loss of one or more of our existing suppliers or our inability to develop relationships with new suppliers could reduce our competitiveness, slow our plans for further expansion, and cause our net sales and operating results to be adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. We source the over 4,000 products that we stock and sell from approximately 250 domestic and international suppliers. We source a large number of those products from foreign manufacturers, including 50% of our products from a group of ten suppliers located in Asia, Europe and the United States. Our largest supplier accounted for approximately 18% of our total purchases in 2017.  We generally take title to these products sourced from foreign suppliers overseas and are responsible for arranging shipment to our distribution centers. Financial instability among key suppliers, political instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, and transport capacity and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupt the movement of products through our supply chain or increase the costs of our products.. <U+FEFF>. Our ability to offer compelling products, particularly products made of unique stone, depends on the continued availability of sufficient suitable natural products.. <U+FEFF>. Our business strategy depends on offering a wide assortment of compelling products to our customers. We sell, among other things, products made from various natural stones from quarries throughout the world. Our ability to obtain an adequate volume and quality of hard-to-find products depends on our suppliers ability to furnish those products, which, in turn, could be affected by many things, including the exhaustion of stone quarries. If our suppliers cannot deliver sufficient products, and we cannot find replacement suppliers, our net sales and operating results may be adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. If our suppliers do not use ethical business practices or comply with applicable laws and regulations, our reputation could be harmed due to negative publicity and we could be subject to legal risk.. <U+FEFF>. We do not control the operations of our suppliers. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will comply with applicable environmental and labor laws and regulations or operate in a legal, ethical, and responsible manner. Violation of environmental, labor or other laws by our suppliers or their failure to operate in a legal, ethical, or responsible manner could reduce demand for our products if, as a result of such violation or failure, we attract negative publicity. Further, such conduct could expose us to legal risks as a result of the purchase of products from non-compliant suppliers.. <U+FEFF>. Failure to address product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. If our products do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. All of our suppliers must comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we sell in our stores comply with all safety standards. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to private ligation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. In addition, negative customer perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our customers to purchase from our competitors, resulting in a decrease in our sales. In those circumstances, it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers.. 7. Table Of Contents. If customers are unable to obtain third-party financing at satisfactory rates, sales of our products could be materially adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations have been, and may continue to be affected, by various economic factors. Deterioration in the current economic environment could lead to reduced consumer and business spending, including by our customers. It may also cause customers to shift their spending to products that we either do not sell or that generate lower profitably for us. Further, reduced access to credit may adversely affect the ability of consumers to purchase our products. This potential reduction in access to credit may adversely impact our ability to offer customers credit card financing through third-party credit providers on terms similar to those offered currently, or at all. In addition, economic conditions, including decreases in access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructuring, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, which may adversely impact our industry, business, and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Any failure by us to successfully anticipate consumer trends may lead to loss of consumer acceptance of our products, resulting in reduced revenues.. <U+FEFF>. Our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing trends in the tile industry and consumer demands in a timely manner. If we fail to identify and respond to emerging trends, consumer acceptance of our merchandise and our image with current or potential customers may be harmed, which could reduce our revenues. Additionally, if we misjudge market trends, we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to reduce the sales price of such products, which would have a negative impact on our gross profit and cash flow. Conversely, shortages of products that prove popular could also reduce our revenues.. <U+FEFF>. We depend on a few key employees, and if we lose the services of these employees, we may not be able to run our business effectively.. <U+FEFF>. Our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key executive, merchandising, marketing, and sales personnel. If any of these key employees ceases to be employed by us, we would have to hire additional qualified personnel. Our ability to successfully hire other experienced and qualified key employees cannot be assured and may be difficult because we face competition for these professionals from our competitors, our suppliers and other companies operating in our industry. As a result, the loss or unavailability of any of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on us. Specifically, our founder and former Chief Executive Officer currently serves as our interim Chief Executive Officer and no assurance can be given that a suitable replacement can be hired.. <U+FEFF>. The burden of debt under our existing credit facility and additional debt could adversely affect us, make us more vulnerable to adverse economic or industry conditions, and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations or from funding our strategies.. We have entered into a credit facility with Fifth Third Bank, Bank of America, N.A., and The Huntington National Bank on June 2, 2015. As of December 31, 2017, our term loan balance was $11.3 million and the balance on our revolving line of credit was $15.0 million. The amount of available future borrowings on our revolving credit facility was $60.0 million as of December 31, 2017. The terms of our credit facility and the burden of the indebtedness incurred thereunder could have serious consequences for us, such as:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, expansion strategy, or other needs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility in planning for, adverse changes in economic, industry, and competitive conditions; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreasing our vulnerability to increases in interest rates if borrowings under the credit facility are subject to variable interest rates.. 8. Table Of Contents. <U+FEFF>. Our credit facility also contains negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability to, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur indebtedness;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcreate liens;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tengage in mergers or consolidations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsell assets (including pursuant to sale and leaseback transactions);.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake investments, acquisitions, loans, or advances;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake capital expenditures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trepay, prepay, or redeem certain indebtedness;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tengage in certain transactions with affiliates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into agreements limiting subsidiary distributions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into agreements limiting the ability to create liens;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tamend our organizational document in a way that has a material effect on the lenders or administrative agent under our credit facility; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchange our lines of business.. <U+FEFF>. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit, or seek amendments to our debt agreements that would provide for terms more favorable to such lender and that we may have to accept under the circumstances. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lender under our credit facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness.. If we fail to hire, train, and retain qualified store managers, sales associates, and other employees, our enhanced customer service could be compromised and we could lose sales to our competitors.. <U+FEFF>. A key element of our competitive strategy is to provide product expertise to our customers through our extensively trained, commissioned sales associates. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel and managers as needed in the future, including qualified sales personnel, our level of customer service may decline, which may decrease our revenues and profitability.. <U+FEFF>. If we are unable to renew or replace current store leases, or if we are unable to enter into leases for additional stores on favorable terms, or if one or more of our current leases is terminated prior to expiration of its stated term and we cannot find suitable alternate locations, our growth and profitability could be negatively impacted.. <U+FEFF>. We currently lease all of our store locations and certain distribution center locations. Many of our current leases provide us with the unilateral option to renew for several additional rental periods at specific rental rates. Our ability to renegotiate favorable terms on an expiring lease or to negotiate favorable terms for a suitable alternate location, and our ability to negotiate favorable lease terms for additional store locations, could depend on conditions in the real estate market, competition for desirable properties, our relationships with current and prospective landlords, or other factors that are not within our control. Any or all of these factors and conditions could negatively impact our growth and profitability.. <U+FEFF>. Compliance with laws or changes in existing or new laws and regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities could adversely affect our business.. <U+FEFF>. We must comply with various laws and regulations at the local, regional, state, federal, and international levels. These laws and regulations change frequently and such changes can impose significant costs and other burdens of compliance on our business and suppliers. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, or the enactment of any new legislation that affects employment/labor, trade, product safety, transportation/logistics, energy costs, health care, tax, or environmental issues, or compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in enforcement priorities by governmental agencies charged with enforcing existing laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business.. <U+FEFF>. We may also be subject to audits by various taxing authorities. Changes in tax laws in any of the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, or adverse outcomes from tax audits that we may be subject to in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, could result in an unfavorable change in our effective tax rate, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. 9. Table Of Contents. The final impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could be materially different from our current estimates, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affect us, including a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018, among others. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, including determining the transition tax, re-measuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities and reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"SAB 118\") allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Since the Tax Act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation is expected over the next twelve months, we consider the accounting of the transition tax, deferred tax re-measurements, and other items to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. Our estimated impact of the new law is based on management's current knowledge and assumptions. We expect to record any adjustments in the next year in accordance with the guidance provided in SAB 118.. <U+FEFF>. As our stores are generally concentrated in the midwest, mid-Atlantic, south and northeast regions of the United States, we are subject to regional risks.. <U+FEFF>. We have a high concentration of stores in the midwest, mid-Atlantic, south and northeast regions. If these markets individually or collectively suffer an economic downturn or other significant adverse event, there could be an adverse impact on same store sales, revenues, and profitability, and the ability to implement our planned expansion program. Any natural disaster, extended adverse weather or other serious disruption in these markets due to fire, tornado, hurricane, or any other calamity could damage inventory and could result in decreased revenues.. <U+FEFF>. Our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in material and energy costs.. <U+FEFF>. Our results may be affected by the prices of the materials used in the manufacture of tile, setting and maintenance materials, and related accessories that we sell. These prices may fluctuate based on a number of factors beyond our control, including: oil prices, changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs, currency exchange rates, and government regulation. In addition, energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution from the manufacturer to our distribution centers and from our regional distribution centers to our stores, utility costs for our distribution and manufacturing centers and stores, and overall costs to purchase products from our suppliers.. <U+FEFF>. We may not be able to adjust the prices of our products, especially in the short-term, to recover these cost increases in materials and energy. A continual rise in material and energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to provide timely delivery to our customers, and any disruption in our delivery capabilities or our related planning and control processes may adversely affect our operating results.. <U+FEFF>. Our success is due in part to our ability to deliver products quickly to our customers, which requires successful planning and distribution infrastructure, including ordering, transportation and receipt processing, and the ability of suppliers to meet distribution requirements. Our ability to maintain this success depends on the continued identification and implementation of improvements to our planning processes, distribution infrastructure, and supply chain. We also need to ensure that our distribution infrastructure and supply chain keep pace with our anticipated growth and increased number of stores. The cost of these enhanced processes could be significant and any failure to maintain, grow, or improve them could adversely affect our operating results. Our business could also be adversely affected if there are delays in product shipments due to freight difficulties, strikes, or other difficulties at our suppliers' principal transport providers, or otherwise.. <U+FEFF>. Our success depends on the effectiveness of our marketing strategy.. <U+FEFF>. We believe that our growth was achieved in part through the effectiveness of our marketing strategies. Historically, we have used internet, print, and radio advertisements containing discounts and promotional offers to encourage customers to visit our stores. A significant portion of our advertising was invested to support the opening of new stores and directed at professional customers. In future periods, we intend to de-emphasize the use of discount offers to attract customers. Limited use of discount and promotional offers in future periods could fail to attract customers resulting in a decrease in store traffic. While our marketing strategy continues to support our growth strategy and remains focused on professional customers, we have broadened the reach and frequency of our advertising to increase the recognition of our value proposition and the number of customers served. We may need to further increase our marketing expense to support our business strategies in the future. If our marketing strategies fail to draw customers in the future,. 10. Table Of Contents. or if the cost of advertising or other marketing materials increases significantly, we could experience declines in our net sales and operating results.. <U+FEFF>. Natural disasters, changes in climate and geo-political events could adversely affect our operating results.. <U+FEFF>. The threat or occurrence of one or more natural disasters or other extreme weather events, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, and the threat or outbreak of terrorism, civil unrest or other hostilities or conflicts could materially adversely affect our financial performance. These events may result in damage to, or destruction or closure of, our stores, distribution centers and other properties. Such events can also adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and other properties, can modify consumer purchasing patterns and decrease disposable income, and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network.. <U+FEFF>. Our ability to control labor costs is limited, which may negatively affect our business.. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates, the impact of legislation or regulations governing healthcare benefits or labor relations, such as the Affordable Care Act, and health and other insurance costs. If our labor and/or benefit costs increase, we may not be able to hire or maintain qualified personnel to the extent necessary to execute our competitive strategy, which could adversely affect our results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are unable to protect the integrity and security of our customer information.. <U+FEFF>. We depend upon our information technology systems in the conduct of all aspects of our operations. If our information technology systems fail to perform as anticipated, we could experience difficulties in virtually any area of our operations, including but not limited to replenishing inventories or delivering products to store locations in response to consumer demands. It is also possible that our competitors could develop better online platforms than us, which could negatively impact our internet sales. Any of these or other systems-related problems could, in turn, adversely affect our revenues and profitability.. <U+FEFF>. In connection with payment card sales and other transactions, including bank cards, debit cards, credit cards and other merchant cards, we process and transmit confidential banking and payment card information. Additionally, as part of our normal business activities, we collect and store sensitive personal information related to our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to criminal cyber-attacks or security incidents due to employee error, malfeasance or other vulnerabilities. Any such incidents could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Third parties may have the technology and know-how to breach the security of this information, and our security measures and those of our banks, merchant card processing and other technology suppliers may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information. The techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target; accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures.. <U+FEFF>. Many states have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause our customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures. Any security breach, whether successful or not, would harm our reputation and could cause the loss of customers.. <U+FEFF>. Our insurance coverage and self-insurance reserves may not cover future claims.. We maintain various insurance policies for employee health and workers' compensation. We are self-insured on certain health insurance plans and are responsible for losses up to a certain limit for these respective plans. We are also self-insured with regard to workers' compensation coverage, in which case we are responsible for losses up to certain retention limits on both a per-claim and aggregate basis.. <U+FEFF>. For policies under which we are responsible for losses, we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. Fluctuating healthcare costs, our significant growth rate and changes from our past experience with workers' compensation claims could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or employee health insurance costs increase beyond what was expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense. Unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs, which could adversely impact our operating results.. <U+FEFF>. 11. Table Of Contents. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and, while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. We are, and may become, involved in shareholder, consumer, employment, tort or other litigation. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, defending against lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and resources.. <U+FEFF>. The market price of our securities may decline and/or be volatile.. Our common stock price may be volatile and all or part of any investment in our common stock may be lost.. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly. Those fluctuations could be based on various factors in addition to those otherwise described in this report, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour operating performance and the performance of our competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe public's reaction to our filings with the SEC, our press releases and other public announcements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in recommendations or earnings estimates by research analysts who follow us or other companies in our industry;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvariations in general economic conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactions of our current stockholders, including sales of common stock by our directors and executive officers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe arrival or departure of key personnel; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother developments affecting us, our industry or our competitors.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, the stock market may experience significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies but may cause declines in the market price of our common stock. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company or its performance.. <U+FEFF>. If we discontinue or alter our quarterly dividend program, or if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.. <U+FEFF>. The payment of, or continuation of, our quarterly dividend is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and is dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions, tax treatment of dividends in the United States, potential future contractual restrictions contained in credit agreements and other agreements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Additionally, because our quarterly dividend program requires the use of a moderate portion of our cash flow, our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Any failure to pay quarterly dividends after we have announced our intention to do so, or any changes to our quarterly dividend program, may negatively impact our reputation, our stock price, and investor confidence in us.. <U+FEFF>. We are a holding company with no business operations of our own and depend on cash flow from The Tile Shop to meet our obligations.. <U+FEFF>. We are a holding company with no business operations of our own or material assets other than the equity of our subsidiaries. All of our operations are conducted by our subsidiary, The Tile Shop. As a holding company, we will require dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to meet cash requirements. The terms of any future credit facility may restrict our subsidiaries from paying dividends and otherwise transferring cash or other assets to us, although our current facility does not restrict this action. If there is an insolvency, liquidation, or other reorganization of any of our subsidiaries, our stockholders likely will have no right to proceed against their assets. Creditors of those subsidiaries will be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of those subsidiaries before us, as an equity holder, would be entitled to receive any distribution from that sale or disposal. If The Tile Shop is unable to pay dividends or make other payments to us when needed, we will be unable to satisfy our obligations.. <U+FEFF>. Concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.. <U+FEFF>. Our directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates, beneficially hold approximately 25% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, have the ability to influence the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely affect the market price of our securities.. 12. Table Of Contents. <U+FEFF>. Anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.. <U+FEFF>. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta classified Board of Directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our Board of Directors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe exclusive right of our Board of Directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability of our Board of Directors to determine to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the Board of Directors, the chief executive officer, or the Board of Directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of stockholder meetings;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproviding the Board of Directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings of stockholders and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings of stockholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproviding that directors may be removed prior to the expiration of their terms by stockholders only for cause; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.. <U+FEFF>. These provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of us or changes in our management.. <U+FEFF>. As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.. <U+FEFF>"
