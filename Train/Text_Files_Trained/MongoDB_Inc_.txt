[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks or others not specified below materialize, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry. We have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to predict our future results of operations.. We were incorporated in 2007 and introduced MongoDB Community Server in 2009, MongoDB Enterprise Advanced in 2013 and MongoDB Atlas in 2016. As a result of our limited operating history, our ability to forecast our future results of operations is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to accurately predict future growth. Our historical revenue growth has been inconsistent and should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Further, in future periods, our revenue growth could slow or our revenue could decline for a number of reasons, including slowing demand for our subscription offerings and related services, reduced conversion of our open source users to paying customers, increasing competition, changes to technology or our intellectual property or our failure, for any reason, to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities. We have also encountered and will encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and uncertainties described herein. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties and our future revenue growth are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer.. We have a history of losses, and as our costs increase, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.. We have incurred net losses in each period since our inception, including net losses of $96.4 million, $86.7 million and $73.5 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of $443.8 million as of January 31, 2018. We expect our operating expenses to increase significantly as we increase our sales and marketing efforts, continue to invest in research and development, and expand our operations and infrastructure, both domestically and internationally. In addition, we expect to incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other expenses related to being a public company. While our revenue has grown in recent years, if our revenue declines or fails to grow at a rate faster than these increases in our operating expenses, we will not be able to achieve and maintain profitability in future. 11. Table of Contents. periods. As a result, we expect to continue to generate losses. We cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability in the future or that, if we do become profitable, we will be able to sustain profitability.. Because we derive substantially all of our revenue from our database platform, failure of this platform to satisfy customer demands could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.. We derive and expect to continue to derive substantially all of our revenue from our database platform. As such, market adoption of our database platform is critical to our continued success. Demand for our platform is affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including continued market acceptance by developers, the availability of our Community Server offering, the continued volume, variety and velocity of data that is generated, timing of development and release of new offerings by our competitors, technological change, and the rate of growth in our market. If we are unable to continue to meet the demands of our customers and the developer community, our business operations, financial results and growth prospects will be materially and adversely affected.. We currently face significant competition.. The database software market, for both relational and non - relational database products, is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and others may put out competing databases or sell services in connection with existing open source databases, including ours. The principal competitive factors in our market include: mindshare with software developers and IT executives; product capabilities, including flexibility, scalability, performance, security and reliability; flexible deployment options, including in the cloud, on - premise or in a hybrid environment, and ease of deployment; breadth of use cases supported; ease of integration with existing IT infrastructure; robustness of professional services and customer support; price and total cost of ownership; adherence to industry standards and certifications; size of customer base and level of user adoption; strength of sales and marketing efforts; and brand awareness and reputation. If we fail to compete effectively with respect to any of these competitive factors, we may fail to attract new customers or lose or fail to renew existing customers, which would cause our business and results of operations to suffer.. We primarily compete with legacy relational database software providers such as IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and other similar companies. We also compete with non - relational database software providers and certain cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Microsoft Azure. In addition, other large software and internet companies may seek to enter our market.. Some of our actual and potential competitors, in particular the legacy relational database providers, have advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, more established relationships with current or potential customers and commercial partners, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources, stronger brand recognition, larger intellectual property portfolios and broader global distribution and presence. Such competitors may make their products available at a low cost or no cost basis in order to enhance their overall relationships with current or potential customers. Our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. With the introduction of new technologies and new market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. In addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially broader offerings and can bundle competing products with hardware or other software offerings, including their cloud computing and customer relationship management platforms. As a result, customers may choose a bundled offering from our competitors, even if individual products have more limited functionality compared to our software. These larger competitors are also often in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in technology spending, and will therefore not be as susceptible to competition or economic downturns. In addition, some competitors may offer products or services that address one or a limited number of functions at lower prices, with greater depth than our products or in geographies where we do not operate.. Furthermore, our actual and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources and offerings in the markets we address. In addition, third parties with greater available resources may acquire current or potential competitors. As a result of such relationships and acquisitions, our actual or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs, devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products, initiate or withstand substantial price competition, take advantage of other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their offerings more quickly than we do. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors.. If we do not effectively expand our sales and marketing organization, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers.. Increasing our customer base and achieving broader market acceptance of our subscription offerings and related services will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to effectively expand our sales and marketing operations and. 12. Table of Contents. activities. We are substantially dependent on our direct sales force and our marketing efforts to obtain new customers. We plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing organization both domestically and internationally. We believe that there is significant competition for experienced sales professionals with the sales skills and technical knowledge that we require, particularly as we continue to target larger enterprises. In addition, we are currently in the process of replacing our Chief Revenue Officer and we may have difficulty finding someone with the right skills and experience for such position. It may also be more difficult to recruit other sales professionals without a Chief Revenue Officer. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend, in part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining a sufficient number of experienced sales professionals, especially in large markets like New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and London, England. New hires require significant training and time before they achieve full productivity, particularly in new or developing sales territories. Our recent hires and planned hires, including any new Chief Revenue Officer we may hire, may not become as productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business. Because of our limited operating history, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, our sales will increase as we expand our sales and marketing organization or how long it will take for sales personnel to become productive. Our business and results of operations will be harmed if the expansion of our sales and marketing organization does not generate a significant increase in revenue.. Our adoption strategies include offering Community Server and a free tier of MongoDB Atlas, and we may not be able to realize the benefits of these strategies.. To encourage developer usage, familiarity and adoption of our platform, we offer Community Server as an open source offering, analogous to a \"freemium\" offering. Community Server is a free - to - download version of our database that does not include all of the features of our commercial platform. We also offer a free tier of MongoDB Atlas in order to accelerate adoption, promote usage and drive brand and product awareness. We do not know if we will be able to convert these users to paying customers of our platform. Our marketing strategy also depends in part on persuading users who use one of these free versions to convince others within their organization to purchase and deploy our platform. To the extent that users of Community Server or our free tier of MongoDB Atlas do not become, or lead others to become, paying customers, we will not realize the intended benefits of these strategies, and our ability to grow our business or achieve profitability may be harmed.. We have invested significantly in our MongoDB Atlas offering and if it fails to achieve market adoption our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.. We introduced MongoDB Atlas in June 2016. We have less experience marketing, determining pricing for and selling MongoDB Atlas, and we are still determining how to best market, price and support adoption of this offering. We have directed, and intend to continue to direct, a significant portion of our financial and operating resources to develop and grow MongoDB Atlas, including offering a free tier of MongoDB Atlas to generate developer usage and awareness. Although MongoDB Atlas has seen rapid adoption since its commercial launch, we cannot guarantee that rate of adoption will continue at the same pace or at all. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to drive customer adoption of MongoDB Atlas, or if we do so in a way that is not profitable or fails to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.. We could be negatively impacted if the GNU Affero General Public License Version 3 and other open source licenses under which some of our software is licensed are not enforceable.. The latest release of Community Server is licensed under the AGPL. This license states that any program licensed under it may be copied, modified and distributed provided certain conditions are met. It is possible that a court would hold this license to be unenforceable. If a court held this license or certain aspects of this license to be unenforceable, others may be able to use our software to compete with us in the marketplace in a manner not subject to the restrictions set forth in the AGPL.. We offer Community Server under an open source license, which could negatively affect our ability to monetize and protect our intellectual property rights.. We make our Community Server offering available under the AGPL. Community Server is a free - to - download version of our database that includes the core functionality developers need to get started with MongoDB but not all of the features of our commercial platform. The AGPL grants licensees broad freedom to view, use, copy, modify and redistribute the source code of Community Server. Some commercial enterprises consider AGPL - licensed software to be unsuitable for commercial use because of its \"copyleft\" requirement that further distribution of AGPL - licensed software and modifications or adaptations to that software must be made available pursuant to the AGPL as well. However, some of those same. 13. Table of Contents. commercial enterprises do not have the same concerns regarding using the software under the AGPL for internal purposes. As a result, these commercial enterprises may never convert to paying customers of our platform. Anyone can obtain a free copy of Community Server from the Internet, and we do not know who all of our AGPL licensees are. Competitors could develop modifications of our software to compete with us in the marketplace. We do not have visibility into how our software is being used by licensees, so our ability to detect violations of the AGPL is extremely limited.. In addition to Community Server, we contribute other source code to open source projects under open source licenses and release internal software projects under open source licenses, and anticipate doing so in the future. Because the source code for Community Server and any other software we contribute to open source projects or distribute under open source licenses is publicly available, our ability to monetize and protect our intellectual property rights with respect to such source code may be limited or, in some cases, lost entirely.. Our software incorporates third - party open source software, which could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subject us to possible litigation.. Our software includes third - party open source software, and we intend to continue to incorporate third - party open source software in our products in the future. There is a risk that the use of third - party open source software in our software could impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to monetize our software. Although we monitor the incorporation of open source software into our products to avoid such restrictions, we cannot be certain that we have not incorporated open source software in our products or platform in a manner that is inconsistent with our licensing model. Certain open source projects also include other open source software and there is a risk that those dependent open source libraries may be subject to inconsistent licensing terms. This could create further uncertainties as to the governing terms for the open source software we incorporate.. In addition, the terms of certain open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated restrictions or conditions on our use of such software. Additionally, we may from time to time face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the software or derivative works that we developed using such open source software, which could include proprietary portions of our source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the open source licenses. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to make those proprietary portions of our source code freely available, purchase a costly license or cease offering the implicated software or services unless and until we can re - engineer them to avoid infringement. This re - engineering process could require significant additional research and development resources, and we may not be able to complete it successfully.. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of third - party open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third - party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties. In addition, licensors of open source software included in our offerings may, from time to time, modify the terms of their license agreements in such a manner that those license terms may become incompatible with our licensing model, and thus could, among other consequences, prevent us from incorporating the software subject to the modified license.. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and if not addressed, could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. If we are not able to introduce new features or services successfully and to make enhancements to our software or services, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.. Our ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers depends in part on our ability to enhance and improve our software and to introduce new features and services. For example, we introduced MongoDB Atlas in June 2016. To grow our business and remain competitive, we must continue to enhance our software and develop features that reflect the constantly evolving nature of technology and our customers' needs. The success of new products, enhancements and developments depends on several factors: our anticipation of market changes and demands for product features, including timely product introduction and conclusion, sufficient customer demand, cost effectiveness in our product development efforts and the proliferation of new technologies that are able to deliver competitive products and services at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently or more securely. In addition, because our software is designed to operate with a variety of systems, applications, data and devices, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our software to keep pace with changes in such systems. We may not be successful in developing these modifications and enhancements. Furthermore, the addition of features and solutions to our software will increase our research and development expenses. Any new features that we develop may not be introduced in a timely or cost - effective manner or may not achieve the market acceptance necessary to generate sufficient revenue to justify the related expenses. It is difficult to predict customer adoption. 14. Table of Contents. of new features. Such uncertainty limits our ability to forecast our future results of operations and subjects us to a number of challenges, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. If we cannot address such uncertainties and successfully develop new features, enhance our software or otherwise overcome technological challenges and competing technologies, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.. We also offer professional services including consulting and training and must continually adapt to assist our customers in deploying our software in accordance with their specific IT strategies. If we cannot introduce new services or enhance our existing services to keep pace with changes in our customers' deployment strategies, we may not be able to attract new customers, retain existing customers and expand their use of our software or secure renewal contracts, which are important for the future of our business.. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to penetrate the existing market for database products, as well as the growth and expansion of the market for database products.. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to service existing demand, as well as the continued growth and expansion of the database market. It is difficult to predict demand for our offerings, the conversion from one to the other and related services and the size, growth rate and expansion of these markets, the entry of competitive products or the success of existing competitive products. Our ability to penetrate the existing database market and any expansion of the market depends on a number of factors, including cost, performance and perceived value associated with our subscription offerings, as well as our customers' willingness to adopt an alternative approach to relational and other database products available in the market. Furthermore, many of our potential customers have made significant investments in relational databases, such as offerings from Oracle, and may be unwilling to invest in new products. If the market for databases fails to grow at the rate that we anticipate or decreases in size or we are not successful in penetrating the existing market, our business would be harmed.. Our future quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price could decline substantially.. Our results of operations, including our revenue, operating expenses and cash flows may vary significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, may be difficult to predict and may or may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business and period - to - period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Some of the factors that may cause our results of operations to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:. • changes in actual and anticipated growth rates of our revenue, customers and other key operating metrics;. • new product announcements, pricing changes and other actions by competitors;. • the mix of revenue and associated costs attributable to subscriptions for our MongoDB Enterprise Advanced and MongoDB Atlas offerings and professional services, as such relative mix may impact our gross margins and operating income;. • the mix of revenue and associated costs attributable to sales where subscriptions are bundled with services versus sold on a standalone basis and sales by us and our partners;. • our ability to attract new customers;. • our ability to retain customers and expand their usage of our software, particularly for our largest customers;. • the inability to enforce our AGPL license;. • delays in closing sales, including the timing of renewals, which may result in revenue being pushed into the next quarter, particularly because a large portion of our sales occur toward the end of each quarter;. • the timing of revenue recognition;. • the mix of revenue attributable to larger transactions as opposed to smaller transactions;. • changes in customers' budgets and in the timing of their budgeting cycles and purchasing decisions;. • customers and potential customers opting for alternative products, including developing their own in - house solutions, or opting to use only the free version of our products;. 15. Table of Contents. • fluctuations in currency exchange rates;. • our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;. • the timing and success of new products, features and services offered by us and our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, customers or strategic partners;. • significant security breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to, the delivery and use of our software;. • our failure to maintain the level of service uptime and performance required by our customers;. • the collectability of receivables from customers and resellers, which may be hindered or delayed if these customers or resellers experience financial distress;. • general economic conditions, both domestically and internationally, as well as economic conditions specifically affecting industries in which our customers participate;. • sales tax and other tax determinations by authorities in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business;. • the impact of new accounting pronouncements; and. • fluctuations in stock - based compensation expense.. The occurrence of one or more of the foregoing and other factors may cause our results of operations to vary significantly. We also intend to continue to invest significantly to grow our business in the near future rather than optimizing for profitability or cash flows. In addition, we expect to incur significant additional expenses due to the increased costs of operating as a public company. Accordingly, historical patterns and our results of operations in any one quarter may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance. Additionally, if our quarterly results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts who follow our stock, the price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.. We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. If we fail to continue to grow and to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, increase our revenue, improve our results of operations, maintain high levels of service, or adequately address competitive challenges.. We have recently experienced a period of rapid growth in our business, operations, and employee headcount. For fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, our total revenue was $154.5 million, $101.4 million and $65.3 million, respectively, representing a 52% and 55% growth rate, respectively. We have also significantly increased the size of our customer base from over 1,100 customers as of January 31, 2015 to over 5,700 customers as of January 31, 2018, and we grew from 383 employees as of January 31, 2015 to 962 employees as of January 31, 2018. We expect to continue to expand our operations and employee headcount in the near term. Our success will depend in part on our ability to continue to grow and to manage this growth, domestically and internationally, effectively.. Our recent growth has placed, and future growth will continue to place, a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We will need to continue to improve our operational, financial, and management processes and controls, and our reporting systems and procedures to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, which will require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources. If we fail to implement these infrastructure improvements effectively, our ability to ensure uninterrupted operation of key business systems and comply with the rules and regulations that are applicable to public reporting companies will be impaired. Further, if we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations, the quality of our products and services could suffer, the preservation of our culture, values and entrepreneurial environment may change and we may not be able to adequately address competitive challenges. This could impair our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and expand their use of our products and services, all of which would adversely affect our brand, overall business, results of operations and financial condition.. 16. Table of Contents. If our security measures, or those of our service providers, are breached or unauthorized access to private or proprietary data is otherwise obtained, our software may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce or terminate their use of our software, and we may incur significant liabilities.. Because our software, which can be deployed in the cloud, on - premise or in a hybrid environment and can be hosted by our customers or can be hosted by us as a service, allows customers to store and transmit data, there exists an inherent risk of a security breach or other security incident, which may result in the loss of, or unauthorized access to, this data. For example, since January 2017, industry publications have reported ransomware attacks on over 80,000 MongoDB instances. Almost all of these instances were launched by users with our Community Server offering rather than users of MongoDB Enterprise Advanced. We believe these attacks were due to the users' failure to properly turn on the recommended security settings when running MongoDB. We, or our service providers, may also suffer a security breach or other security incident affecting the systems or networks used to operate our business, or otherwise impacting the data that is stored or processed in the conduct of our business. Any such security breach or other security incident could lead to litigation, indemnity obligations, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, and other liability. If our security measures, or those of our services providers, are breached or are believed to have been breached, whether as a result of third - party action, employee, vendor, or contractor error, malfeasance, phishing attacks, social engineering or otherwise, unauthorized access to or loss of data may result. If any of these events occur, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer, and we may face regulatory investigations and actions, litigation, indemnity obligations, damages for contract breach, and fines and penalties for violations of applicable laws or regulations. Security breaches could also result in significant costs for remediation that may include liability for stolen assets or information and repair of system damage that may have been caused, incentives offered to customers or other business partners in an effort to maintain business relationships after a breach, and other liabilities. Similarly, if a cyber incident (including any accidental or intentional computer or network issues such as phishing attacks, viruses, denial of service (\"DoS\"), attacks, malware installation, server malfunction, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other computer assets, adware, or other similar issues) impairs the integrity or availability of our systems, or those of our service providers, by affecting our data or the data of our customers, or reducing access to or shutting down one or more of our or our service providers' computing systems or IT network, or if any such impairment is perceived to have occurred, we may be subject to negative treatment by our customers, our business partners, the press, and the public at large. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, and cybersecurity threats continue to evolve and are difficult to predict due to advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography and new and sophisticated methods used by criminals, including phishing, social engineering or other illicit acts. We may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any or all of these issues could harm our reputation and negatively impact our ability to attract new customers and increase engagement by existing customers, cause existing customers to elect not to renew their subscriptions, or subject us to third - party lawsuits, regulatory fines, actions, and investigations, or other actions or liability, thereby adversely affecting our financial results.. While we maintain general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors or omissions, we cannot assure you that such coverage will be adequate or otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to claims alleging compromises of personal or other confidential data or otherwise relating to privacy or data security matters or that such coverage will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.. Our sales cycle may be long and is unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense.. The timing of our sales and related revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for our offerings. We are often required to spend significant time and resources to better educate and familiarize potential customers with the value proposition of paying for our products and services. The length of our sales cycle, from initial evaluation to payment for our offerings is generally three to nine months, but can vary substantially from customer to customer or from application to application within a given customer. As the purchase and deployment of our products can be dependent upon customer initiatives, our sales cycle can extend to more than a year for some customers. Customers often view a subscription to our products and services as a strategic decision and significant investment and, as a result, frequently require considerable time to evaluate, test and qualify our product offering prior to entering into or expanding a subscription. During the sales cycle, we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing and contract negotiation activities, which may not result in a sale. Additional factors that may influence the length and variability of our sales cycle include:. •the effectiveness of our sales force, in particular new sales people as we increase the size of our sales force;. 17. Table of Contents. •the discretionary nature of purchasing and budget cycles and decisions;. •the obstacles placed by a customer's procurement process;. •our ability to convert users of our free Community Server offering to paying customers;. •economic conditions and other factors impacting customer budgets;. •customer evaluation of competing products during the purchasing process; and. •evolving customer demands.. Given these factors, it is difficult to predict whether and when a sale will be completed, and when revenue from a sale will be recognized, particularly since we generally recognize revenue over the term of a subscription and in some cases, when our subscription offering is purchased with a service contract, we do not recognize revenue from the subscription until services are provided, which may result in lower than expected revenue in any given period, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. We have a limited history with our subscription offerings and pricing model and if, in the future, we are forced to reduce prices for our subscription offerings, our revenue and results of operations will be harmed.. We have limited experience with respect to determining the optimal prices for our subscription offerings. As the market for databases evolves, or as new competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours, we may be unable to attract new customers or convert Community Server users to paying customers on terms or based on pricing models that we have used historically. In the past, we have been able to increase our prices for our subscriptions offerings, but we may choose not to introduce or be unsuccessful in implementing future price increases. As a result of these and other factors, in the future we may be required to reduce our prices or be unable to increase our prices, or it may be necessary for us to increase our services or product offerings without additional revenue to remain competitive, all of which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.. If we are unable to attract new customers in a manner that is cost - effective and assures customer success, we will not be able to grow our business, which would adversely affect our results of operations, and financial condition.. In order to grow our business, we must continue to attract new customers in a cost - effective manner and enable these customers to realize the benefits associated with our products and services. We may not be able to attract new customers for a variety of reasons, including as a result of their use of traditional relational and/or other database products, and their internal timing, budget or other constraints that hinder their ability to migrate to or adopt our products or services.. Even if we do attract new customers, the cost of new customer acquisition, product implementation and ongoing customer support may prove so high as to prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability. For example, in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, total sales and marketing expense represented 71%, 78% and 87% of revenue, respectively. We intend to continue to hire additional sales personnel, increase our marketing activities to help educate the market about the benefits of our platform and services, grow our domestic and international operations, and build brand awareness. We also intend to continue to cultivate our relationships with developers through continued investment and growth of our MongoDB World, MongoDB Advocacy Hub, User Groups, MongoDB University and our partner ecosystem of global system integrators, value - added resellers and independent software vendors. If the costs of these sales and marketing efforts increase dramatically, if we do not experience a substantial increase in leverage from our partner ecosystem, or if our sales and marketing efforts do not result in substantial increases in revenue, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition, while we expect to continue to invest in our professional services organization to accelerate our customers' ability to adopt our products and ultimately create and expand their use of our products over time, we cannot assure you that any of these investments will lead to the cost - effective acquisition of additional customers.. Our business and results of operations depend substantially on our customers renewing their subscriptions with us and expanding their use of software and related services. Any decline in our customer renewals or failure to convince our customers to broaden their use of subscription offerings and related services would harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.. Our subscription offerings are term - based and a majority of our subscription contracts were one year in duration in fiscal year 2018. In order for us to maintain or improve our results of operations, it is important that our customers renew their subscriptions with us when the existing subscription term expires, and renew on the same or more favorable quantity. 18. Table of Contents. and terms. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions, and we may not be able to accurately predict customer renewal rates. In addition, the growth of our business depends in part on our customers expanding their use of subscription offerings and related services. Historically, some of our customers have elected not to renew their subscriptions with us for a variety of reasons, including as a result of changes in their strategic IT priorities, budgets, costs and, in some instances, due to competing solutions. Our retention rate may also decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors, including our customers' satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our software, the increase in the contract value of subscription and support contracts from new customers, the effectiveness of our customer support services, our pricing, the prices of competing products or services, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base, global economic conditions, and the other risk factors described herein. As a result, we cannot assure you that customers will renew subscriptions or increase their usage of our software and related services. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions or renew on less favorable terms, or if we are unable to expand our customers' use of our software, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.. If we fail to offer high quality support, our business and reputation could suffer.. Our customers rely on our personnel for support of our software included in our MongoDB Enterprise Advanced, MongoDB Atlas and MongoDB Professional packages. High - quality support is important for the renewal and expansion of our agreements with existing customers. The importance of high - quality support will increase as we expand our business and pursue new customers. If we do not help our customers quickly resolve issues and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell new software to existing and new customers could suffer and our reputation and relationships with existing or potential customers could be harmed.. Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our software could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.. Our software is complex, and therefore, undetected errors, failures or bugs have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. Our software is used in IT environments with different operating systems, system management software, applications, devices, databases, servers, storage, middleware, custom and third - party applications and equipment and networking configurations, which may cause errors or failures in the IT environment into which our software is deployed. This diversity increases the likelihood of errors or failures in those IT environments. Despite testing by us, real or perceived errors, failures or bugs may not be found until our customers use our software. Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our products could result in negative publicity, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our software, harm to our brand, weakening of our competitive position, or claims by customers for losses sustained by them or failure to meet the stated service level commitments in our customer agreements. In such an event, we may be required, or may choose, for customer relations or other reasons, to expend significant additional resources in order to help correct the problem. Any errors, failures or bugs in our software could also impair our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers or expand their use of our software, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Because our software and services could be used to collect and store personal information, domestic and international privacy concerns could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit sales of our software.. Personal privacy has become a significant issue in the United States, Europe and in many other countries where we offer our software and services. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Many federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws, rules and regulations regarding the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal information and breach notification procedures. Interpretation of these laws, rules and regulations and their application to our software and professional services in the United States and foreign jurisdictions is ongoing and cannot be fully determined at this time.. In the United States, these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\"), the Gramm Leach Bliley Act and state laws relating to privacy and data security. Internationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy legal framework with which we, or our customers, must comply. There may be substantial amounts of personally identifiable information or other sensitive information uploaded to our services and managed using our software.. In December 2015, European Union (\"EU\") institutions reached agreement on a draft regulation that was formally adopted in April 2016, referred to as the General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\"), which will be enforced beginning in May 2018. The GDPR updates and modernizes the principles of the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive. The. 19. Table of Contents. GDPR significantly increases the level of sanctions for non - compliance from those in existing EU data protection law. EU data protection authorities will have the power to impose administrative fines for violations of the GDPR of up to a maximum of \20020 million or 4% of the data controller's or data processor's total worldwide global turnover for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and violations of the GDPR may also lead to damages claims by data controllers and data subjects. Since we act as a data processor for our MongoDB Atlas customers, we are taking steps to cause our processes to be compliant with applicable portions of the GDPR, but we cannot assure you that such steps will be effective.. In addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different self - regulatory standards that may apply to us. Because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws, regulations, rules and other standards are still uncertain, it is possible that these laws, rules, regulations, and other actual or alleged legal obligations, such as contractual or self - regulatory obligations, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data management practices or the features of our software. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits and other claims, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our software, which we may be unable to do in a commercially reasonable manner or at all, and which could have an adverse effect on our business. Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations and other actual or alleged obligations, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and adversely affect our business.. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our software. Privacy concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our software particularly in certain industries and foreign countries.. The estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth included in this Form 10-K may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.. Market opportunity estimates and growth forecasts included in this Form 10-K are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth forecasted in this Form 10-K, our business could fail to grow for a variety of reasons, which would adversely affect our results of operations.. We could incur substantial costs in protecting or defending our intellectual property rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could reduce the value of our software and brand.. Our success and ability to compete depend in part upon our intellectual property rights. As of January 31, 2018, we had twelve issued patents and 40 pending patent applications in the United States, which may not result in issued patents. Even if a patent issues, we cannot assure you that such patent will be adequate to protect our business. We primarily rely on copyright, trademark laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality or other contractual arrangements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate. In order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to establish, monitor and enforce such rights. Litigation brought to enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time - consuming and distracting to management and could be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights, which may result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and effective intellectual property protection and mechanisms may not be available in those jurisdictions. We may need to expend additional resources to defend our intellectual property in these countries, and our inability to do so could impair our business or adversely affect our international expansion. Even if we are able to secure our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurances that such rights will provide us with competitive advantages or distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology. In addition, we regularly contribute source code under open source licenses and have made some of our own software available under open source licenses, and we include third - party open source software in our products. Because the source code for any software we contribute to open source projects or distribute under open source licenses is publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights with respect to such source code may be limited or lost entirely. In addition, from time to time, we may face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the software or derivative works that we have developed using third - party open source software, which could include our proprietary source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open - source license.. 20. Table of Contents. Unfavorable conditions in our industry or the global economy or reductions in information technology spending could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our results of operations.. Our results of operations may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our customers. The revenue growth and potential profitability of our business depend on demand for database software and services generally and for our subscription offering and related services in particular. Current or future economic uncertainties or downturns could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Negative conditions in the general economy both in the United States and abroad, including conditions resulting from changes in gross domestic product growth, financial and credit market fluctuations, political turmoil, natural catastrophes, warfare and terrorist attacks on the United States, Europe, the Asia Pacific region or elsewhere, could cause a decrease in business investments, including spending on information technology, and negatively affect the growth of our business. To the extent our database software is perceived by customers and potential customers as costly, or too difficult to deploy or migrate to, our revenue may be disproportionately affected by delays or reductions in general information technology spending. Also, competitors, many of whom are larger and more established than we are, may respond to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers. In addition, the increased pace of consolidation in certain industries may result in reduced overall spending on our subscription offerings and related services. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown, instability or recovery, generally or within any particular industry. If the economic conditions of the general economy or markets in which we operate worsen from present levels, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.. If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our partners, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.. In addition to our direct sales force and our website, we use strategic partners, such as global system integrators, value - added resellers and independent software vendors to sell our subscription offerings and related services. Our agreements with our partners are generally nonexclusive, meaning our partners may offer their customers products and services of several different companies, including products and services that compete with ours, or may themselves be or become competitors. If our partners do not effectively market and sell our subscription offerings and related services, choose to use greater efforts to market and sell their own products and services or those of our competitors, or fail to meet the needs of our customers, our ability to grow our business and sell our subscription offerings and related services may be harmed. Our partners may cease marketing our subscription offerings or related services with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty. The loss of a substantial number of our partners, our possible inability to replace them, or the failure to recruit additional partners could harm our growth objectives and results of operations.. We rely upon third - party cloud providers to host our cloud offering; any disruption of or interference with our use of third - party cloud providers would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. We outsource substantially all of the infrastructure relating to MongoDB Atlas across AWS, Microsoft Azure and GCP to host our cloud offering. Customers of MongoDB Atlas need to be able to access our platform at any time, without interruption or degradation of performance, and we provide them with service level commitments with respect to uptime. Third - party cloud providers run their own platforms that we access, and we are, therefore, vulnerable to their service interruptions. We may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time as a result of problems with our third - party cloud providers' infrastructure. Lack of availability of this infrastructure could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud or security attacks that we cannot predict or prevent. Such outages could lead to the triggering of our service level agreements and the issuance of credits to our cloud offering customers, which may impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if our security, or that of any of these third - party cloud providers, is compromised, our software is unavailable or our customers are unable to use our software within a reasonable amount of time or at all, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within a period of time acceptable to our customers. It is possible that our customers and potential customers would hold us accountable for any breach of security affecting a third - party cloud provider's infrastructure and we may incur significant liability from those customers and from third parties with respect to any breach affecting these systems. We may not be able to recover a material portion of our liabilities to our customers and third parties from a third - party cloud provider. It may also become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times, as our software becomes more complex and the usage of our software increases. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.. 21. Table of Contents. Interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology and infrastructure may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Our continued growth depends in part on the ability of our existing customers and new customers to access our software at any time and within an acceptable amount of time. We may experience service disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes or failures, human or software errors, malicious acts, terrorism or capacity constraints. Capacity constraints could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud or security attacks. In some instances, we may not be able to identify and/or remedy the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance as our software offerings and customer implementations become more complex. If our software is unavailable or if our customers are unable to access features of our software within a reasonable amount of time or at all, or if other performance problems occur, our business, results of operations and financial conditions may be adversely affected.. Incorrect or improper implementation or use of our software could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.. Our database software and related services are designed to be deployed in a wide variety of technology environments, including in large - scale, complex technology environments, and we believe our future success will depend at least, in part, on our ability to support such deployments. Implementations of our software may be technically complicated, and it may not be easy to maximize the value of our software without proper implementation and training. For example, since January 2017, industry publications have reported ransomware attacks on over 80,000 MongoDB instances. Almost all of these instances were launched by users with our Community Server offering rather than users of MongoDB Enterprise Advanced. We believe these attacks were due to the users' failure to properly turn on the recommended security settings when running MongoDB. If our customers are unable to implement our software successfully, or in a timely manner, customer perceptions of our company and our software may be impaired, our reputation and brand may suffer, and customers may choose not to renew their subscriptions or increase their purchases of our related services.. Our customers and partners need regular training in the proper use of and the variety of benefits that can be derived from our software to maximize its potential. We often work with our customers to achieve successful implementations, particularly for large, complex deployments. Our failure to train customers on how to efficiently and effectively deploy and use our software, or our failure to provide effective support or professional services to our customers, whether actual or perceived, may result in negative publicity or legal actions against us. Also, as we continue to expand our customer base, any actual or perceived failure by us to properly provide these services will likely result in lost opportunities for follow - on sales of our related services.. If we fail to meet our service level commitments, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.. Our agreements with customers typically provide for service level commitments. Our MongoDB Professional and MongoDB Enterprise Advanced customers typically get service level commitments with certain guaranteed response times and comprehensive 24x365 coverage. Our MongoDB Atlas customers typically get monthly uptime service level commitments, where we are required to provide a service credit for any extended periods of downtime. The complexity and quality of our customer's implementation and the performance and availability of cloud services and cloud infrastructure are outside our control and, therefore, we are not in full control of whether we can meet these service level commitments. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if we fail to meet our service level commitments for any reason. Any extended service outages could adversely affect our business, reputation and brand.. We rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel, including senior management and our engineering, professional services, sales and technology professionals; if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel, our business would be harmed.. We believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our senior management team, particularly our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, and our highly skilled team members, including our sales personnel, client services personnel and software engineers. We do not maintain key man insurance on any of our executive officers or key employees. From time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team resulting from the termination or departure of our executive officers and key employees. The majority of our senior management and key employees are employed on an at - will basis, which means that they could terminate their employment with us at any time.  The loss of any of our senior management or key employees could adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts they. 22. Table of Contents. have undertaken and to execute our business plan, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements. We are currently in the process of replacing our Chief Revenue Officer and such a transition may take longer than we expect, disrupt our ongoing business, lead to increased attrition and divert our management's attention, which may adversely impact our results of operations in the near term. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees.. Our ability to successfully pursue our growth strategy also depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain our personnel. Competition for well - qualified employees in all aspects of our business, including sales personnel, client services personnel and software engineers, is intense. Our recruiting efforts focus on elite organizations and our primary recruiting competition are well - known, high - paying technology companies. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well - qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business would be adversely affected.. If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, especially among developers, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.. We believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand, especially with developers, in a cost - effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our software and attracting new customers. Brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or increase revenue, and even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. For instance, our continued focus and investment in MongoDB World, MongoDB University, and similar investments in our brand and customer engagement and education may not generate a sufficient financial return. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or continue to incur substantial expenses, we may fail to attract or retain customers necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand - building efforts, or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption of our platform.. Our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity and entrepreneurial spirit we have worked hard to foster, which could harm our business.. We believe that our culture has been and will continue to be a key contributor to our success. From January 31, 2015 to January 31, 2018, we increased the size of our workforce by 579 employees, and we expect to continue to hire aggressively as we expand, especially research and development and sales and marketing personnel. If we do not continue to maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we may be unable to foster the innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurial spirit we believe we need to support our growth. Moreover, once the lock-up period in connection with our initial public offering (\"IPO\") expires in April 2018, many of our existing employees may be able to receive significant proceeds from sales of our Class A common stock in the public markets, which could lead to employee attrition and disparities of wealth among our employees that adversely affect relations among employees and our culture in general.  Our substantial anticipated headcount growth and our transition from a private company to a public company may result in a change to our corporate culture, which could harm our business.. We depend and rely upon SaaS technologies from third parties to operate our business, and interruptions or performance problems with these technologies may adversely affect our business and results of operations.. We rely on hosted SaaS applications from third parties in order to operate critical functions of our business, including enterprise resource planning, order management, contract management billing, project management, and accounting and other operational activities. If these services become unavailable due to extended outages, interruptions or because they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms, our expenses could increase, our ability to manage finances could be interrupted and our processes for managing sales of our platform and supporting our customers could be impaired until equivalent services, if available, are identified, obtained and implemented, all of which could adversely affect our business.. We may be subject to intellectual property rights claims by third parties, which may be costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies.. Companies in the software and technology industries, including some of our current and potential competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have in the past and may in the future be subject to claims that we have misappropriated, misused or infringed the intellectual property rights of our competitors, non - practicing entities or other third parties. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that our software incorporates third - party open source software.. 23. Table of Contents. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be very time - consuming and expensive and could divert our management's attention and other resources. These claims could also subject us to significant liability for damages, potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights. These claims could also result in our having to stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party's rights, some of which we have invested considerable effort and time to bring to market. We might be required to seek a license for the intellectual property, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. As a result, we may be required to develop alternative non - infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense. If we cannot license or develop technology for any aspect of our business that may ultimately be determined to infringe on the intellectual property rights of another party, we could be forced to limit or stop sales of subscriptions to our software and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these results would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.. Our agreements with customers and other third parties may include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, damages caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our software, services or other contractual obligations. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we normally contractually limit our liability with respect to such indemnity obligations, we may still incur substantial liability related to them. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing customers and new customers and harm our business and results of operations.. We recognize a majority of our revenue over the term of our customer contracts. Consequently, increases or decreases in new sales may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations and may be difficult to discern.. We currently recognize subscription revenue from subscription customers ratably over the terms of their contracts. The majority of our subscription contracts were one year in duration in fiscal year 2018. As a result, a portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any single quarter may have a small impact on the revenue that we recognize for that quarter. However, such a decline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and potential changes in our pricing policies or rate of customer expansion or retention, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. In addition, a significant majority of our costs are expensed as incurred, while revenue is recognized over the life of the subscription agreement. As a result, growth in the number of customers could continue to result in our recognition of higher costs and lower revenue in the earlier periods of our subscription agreements. Finally, our subscription - based revenue model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers and significant increases in the size of subscriptions with existing customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued FASB Accounting Standards Updated (\"ASU\") No. 2014 - 09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605, Revenue Recognition. We are evaluating ASU 2014-09 and have not determined the impact it may have on our financial reporting. However, upon adoption, we may be required to recognize revenue differently with respect to our subscriptions, which may cause variability in our reported operating results due to periodic or long-term changes in the mix among our subscription offerings. For further details, see the risk factor below titled \"Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\". Because our long - term growth strategy involves further expansion of our sales to customers outside the United States, our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations.. A component of our growth strategy involves the further expansion of our operations and customer base internationally. In the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, total revenue generated from customers outside the United States was 36%, 35% and 31%, respectively, of our total revenue. We currently have international offices outside of North America throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa (\"EMEA\") and the Asia - Pacific region, focusing primarily on selling our products and services in those regions. In the future, we may expand to other international locations. Our current international operations and future initiatives involve a variety of risks, including:. • changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions;. 24. Table of Contents. • the need to adapt and localize our products for specific countries;. • greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles;. • unexpected changes in laws, regulatory requirements, taxes or trade laws;. • more stringent regulations relating to privacy and data security and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal information, particularly in EMEA;. • differing labor regulations, especially in EMEA, where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the United States, including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations;. • challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs;. • difficulties in managing a business in new markets with diverse cultures, languages, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems and regulatory systems;. • increased travel, real estate, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with international operations;. • currency exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses, and the cost and risk of entering into hedging transactions if we chose to do so in the future;. • limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;. • laws and business practices favoring local competitors or general preferences for local vendors;. • limited or insufficient intellectual property protection or difficulties enforcing our intellectual property;. • political instability or terrorist activities;. • exposure to liabilities under anti - corruption and anti - money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions; and. • adverse tax burdens and foreign exchange controls that could make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash.. Our limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake will not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our business and results of operations will suffer.. If currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the future, our financial results, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected.. As we continue to expand our international operations, we become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Often, contracts executed by our foreign operations are denominated in the currency of that country or region and a portion of our revenue is therefore subject to foreign currency risks. However, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the real cost of our subscription offerings and related services to our customers outside of the United States, adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition. We incur expenses for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our non - U.S. locations in the local currency. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could result in the dollar equivalent of such expenses being higher. This could have a negative impact on our reported results of operations. To date, we have not engaged in any hedging strategies, and any such strategies, such as forward contracts, options and foreign exchange swaps related to transaction exposures that we may implement in the future to mitigate this risk may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations. Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments.. 25. Table of Contents. Changes in laws and regulations related to the internet or changes in the internet infrastructure itself may diminish the demand for our software, and could have a negative impact on our business.. The future success of our business, and particularly our cloud offerings, such as MongoDB Atlas, depends upon the continued use of the internet as a primary medium for commerce, communication and business applications. Federal, state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of the internet as a commercial medium. Changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our software in order to comply with these changes. In addition, government agencies or private organizations may begin to impose taxes, fees or other charges for accessing the internet or commerce conducted via the internet. These laws or charges could limit the growth of internet - related commerce or communications generally, resulting in reductions in the demand for internet - based solutions such as ours.. In addition, the use of the internet as a business tool could be adversely affected due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of internet activity, security, reliability, cost, ease of use, accessibility, and quality of service. The performance of the internet and its acceptance as a business tool have been adversely affected by \"ransomware,\" \"viruses,\" \"worms,\" \"malware,\" \"phishing attacks,\" \"data breaches\" and similar malicious programs, behavior, and events, and the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure. If the use of the internet is adversely affected by these issues, demand for our subscription offerings and related services could suffer.. Our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements are subject to the tax laws of various jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes, which would harm our results of operations.. Based on our current corporate structure, we may be subject to taxation in several jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents. The authorities in these jurisdictions could review our tax returns or require us to file tax returns in jurisdictions in which we are not currently filing, and could impose additional tax, interest and penalties. In addition, the authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries, assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, or challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, including our transfer pricing. The relevant taxing authorities may determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the intended tax consequences. If such a disagreement was to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, and interest and penalties. Such authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries. Any increase in the amount of taxes we pay or that are imposed on us could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business and results of operations.. We may acquire or invest in companies, which may divert our management's attention and result in additional dilution to our stockholders. We may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions.. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may choose to do so through the acquisition of businesses and technologies rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time - consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions include:. • an acquisition may negatively affect our results of operations because it may require us to incur charges or assume substantial debt or other liabilities, may cause adverse tax consequences or unfavorable accounting treatment, may expose us to claims and disputes by stockholders and third parties, including intellectual property claims and disputes, or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisition;. • we may encounter difficulties or unforeseen expenditures in integrating the business, technologies, products, personnel or operations of any company that we acquire, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us;. • we may not be able to realize anticipated synergies;. 26. Table of Contents. • an acquisition may disrupt our ongoing business, divert resources, increase our expenses and distract our management;. • an acquisition may result in a delay or reduction of customer purchases for both us and the company acquired due to customer uncertainty about continuity and effectiveness of service from either company;. • we may encounter challenges integrating the employees of the acquired company into our company culture;. • we may encounter difficulties in, or may be unable to, successfully sell any acquired products;. • our use of cash to pay for acquisitions would limit other potential uses for our cash;. • if we incur debt to fund any acquisitions, such debt may subject us to material restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, including financial maintenance covenants; and. • if we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease.. The occurrence of any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. We are an \"emerging growth company,\" and our election to comply with the reduced disclosure requirements as a public company may make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors.. For so long as we remain an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \"JOBS Act\"), we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not \"emerging growth companies,\" including not being required to comply with the independent auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes - Oxley Act\"), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, being required to provide fewer years of audited financial statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non - binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will remain an \"emerging growth company\" until the earlier to occur of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following October 23, 2022, (b) in which our annual gross revenue is $1.07 billion or more, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a \"large accelerated filer\" as defined in the Exchange Act, and (2) the date on which we have, during the previous rolling three - year period, issued more than $1 billion in non - convertible debt securities. In addition, the JOBS Act also provides that an \"emerging growth company\" can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have chosen to take advantage of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non - emerging growth companies.. We cannot predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile and may decline.. Failure to comply with anti - bribery, anti - corruption, and anti - money laundering laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the \"FCPA\"), the U.S. Travel Act, the U.K. Bribery Act (the \"Bribery Act\"), and other anti - corruption, anti - bribery and anti - money laundering laws in various jurisdictions around the world. The FCPA, Bribery Act, and similar applicable laws generally prohibit companies, their officers, directors, employees and third - party intermediaries, business partners, and agents from making improper payments or providing other improper things of value to government officials or other persons. We and our third - party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state - owned or affiliated entities and other third parties where we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third - party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, resellers, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. While we have policies and procedures and internal controls to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. To the extent that we learn that any of our employees, third - party intermediaries, agents, or business partners do not adhere to our policies, procedures, or internal controls, we are committed to taking appropriate remedial action. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our directors,. 27. Table of Contents. officers, employees, third - party intermediaries, agents, or business partners have or may have violated such laws, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances. Detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations can be extensive and require a significant diversion of time, resources, and attention from senior management. Any violation of the FCPA, Bribery Act, or other applicable anti - bribery, anti - corruption laws, and anti - money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, fines, and penalties or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and prospects, and financial condition.. Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.. Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"), are subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.. In particular, in May 2014, the FASB issued FASB ASU No. 2014 - 09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. The core principle of ASU 2014 - 09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. As an \"emerging growth company\" the JOBS Act allows us to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act with respect to ASU 2014 - 09. If we lose our \"emerging growth company\" status this year, we could be required to adopt the new revenue standard for our fiscal year ending January 31, 2019. If we remain an \"emerging growth company,\" we will be required to adopt the new standard no later than the fiscal year ending January 31, 2020, though early adoption is permitted.. While we continue to assess the potential impacts of the new revenue standard, we currently expect unearned subscription revenue to decline significantly upon adoption. Currently, as our subscription offerings include software term licenses and post-contract customer support for which we have not established vendor specific objective evidence (\"VSOE\"), the entire subscription fee is recognized ratably over the term of the contract. However, under the new revenue standard, the requirement for VSOE for undelivered elements is eliminated and, as a result, we will be required to identify all deliverables in a contract and recognize revenue based on each deliverable separately. We currently expect that the portion related to the software term license deliverable will be recognized upon delivery. We are in the process of determining the revenue recognition impact for the other deliverables of each contract. We continue to evaluate the effect that the new revenue standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, and preliminary assessments are subject to change.. If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely affected.. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as described in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements,  of this Form 10-K.  The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements include those related to revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts, fair value of stock - based awards, fair value of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants prior to our IPO, legal contingencies, fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of acquired intangible assets and property and equipment, and accounting for income taxes. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our Class A common stock.. 28. Table of Contents. If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes - Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time - consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources.. The Sarbanes - Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting - related costs and significant management oversight.. Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq. We are not currently required to comply with the SEC rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act and are therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. As a public company, we will be required to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing with our second annual report on Form 10 - K.. Our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until after we are no longer an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the JOBS Act. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.. We may require additional capital to support our operations or the growth of our business, and we cannot be certain that this capital will be available on reasonable terms when required, or at all.. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features or otherwise enhance our database software, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to secure additional capital through equity or debt financings. If we raise additional capital, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Any debt financing that we may secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms that are satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be harmed.. 29. Table of Contents. We are a multinational organization faced with increasingly complex tax issues in many jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes in various jurisdictions.. As a multinational organization, we may be subject to taxation in several jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operating results. In addition, the authorities in these jurisdictions could review our tax returns and impose additional tax, interest and penalties, and the authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, any of which could have a material impact on us and the results of our operations.. The enactment of legislation implementing changes in U.S. taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.. Changes to U.S. tax laws, including limitations on the ability of taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and the deferral of certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the United States are repatriated to the United States, as well as changes to U.S. tax laws that may be enacted in the future, could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. Due to expansion of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.. In addition, potential tax reform in the United States may result in significant changes to U.S. federal income taxation law, including changes to the U.S. federal income taxation of corporations (including the Company) and/or changes to the U.S. federal income taxation of stockholders in U.S. corporations, including investors in our Class A common stock. We are currently unable to predict whether such changes will occur and, if so, the impact of such changes, including on the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of our Class A common stock.. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") was enacted on December 22, 2017 and significantly reformed the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"). The Tax Act contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of earnings, limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss (\"NOL\") carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. Given the significant complexity of the Tax Act, anticipated guidance from the Internal Revenue Service about implementing the Tax Act, and the potential for additional guidance from the SEC or the FASB related to the Tax Act, the overall impact of the Tax Act on us is uncertain, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.. Our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.. As of January 31, 2018, we had NOL carryforwards for federal, state and Irish income tax purposes of approximately $209.5 million,  $166.5 million and $182.3 million, respectively, which may be available to offset taxable income in the future, and which expire in various years beginning in the year ending January 31, 2028 for federal purposes and the year ending January 31, 2021 for state purposes if not utilized. Ireland allows NOLs to be carried forward indefinitely. A lack of future taxable income would adversely affect our ability to utilize these NOLs before they expire. In general, under Section 382 of the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \"ownership change\" (as defined under Section 382 of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations) is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre - change NOLs to offset future taxable income. We may experience a future ownership change  under Section 382 of the Code that could affect our ability to utilize the NOLs to offset our income. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to reduce future income tax liabilities, including for state tax purposes. For example, the Tax Act included changes to the uses and limitations of NOLs. While the Tax Act allows for federal NOLs incurred in tax years beginning prior to December 31, 2017 to be carried forward indefinitely, the Tax Act also imposes an 80% limitation on the use of federal NOLs that are generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.. 30. Table of Contents. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs reflected on our balance sheet, even if we attain profitability, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.. Taxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations.. We do not collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales, and we have been advised that such taxes are not applicable to our products and services in certain jurisdictions. Sales and use, value added and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, to us or our end - customers for the past amounts, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. If we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our end - customers, we could be held liable for such costs. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest, or future requirements may adversely affect our results of operations.. We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls.. Our offerings are subject to United States export controls, and we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our offerings. These encryption offerings and the underlying technology may be exported outside of the United States only with the required export authorizations, including by license.. Furthermore, our activities are subject to the U.S. economic sanctions laws and regulations that prohibit the shipment of certain products and services without the required export authorizations or export to countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. While we take precautions to prevent our offerings from being exported in violation of these laws, including obtaining authorizations for our encryption offerings, implementing IP address blocking and screenings against U.S. Government and international lists of restricted and prohibited persons, we cannot guarantee that the precautions we take will prevent violations of export control and sanctions laws.. We also note that if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re - export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected, through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences including government investigations and penalties. We presently incorporate export control compliance requirements in our channel partner agreements. Complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be time - consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.. If we fail to comply with U.S. sanctions and export control laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges, fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers.. Also, various countries, in addition to the United States, regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including import and export permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our offerings or could limit our customers' ability to implement our offerings in those countries. Changes in our offerings or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our offerings in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our offerings globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our offerings to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our offerings by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our offerings to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our offerings or limitation on our ability to export or sell our offerings would likely adversely affect our business operations and financial results.. Our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods and other natural catastrophic events, and to interruption by man - made problems such as power disruptions, computer viruses, data security breaches or terrorism.. Our corporate headquarters is located in New York City, and we have an office in Palo Alto, California and in 32 other locations. A significant natural disaster or man - made problem, such as an earthquake, fire, flood or an act of terrorism, occurring in any of these locations, or where a business partner is located, could adversely affect our business, results of. 31. Table of Contents. operations and financial condition. Further, if a natural disaster or man - made problem were to affect datacenters used by our cloud infrastructure service providers this could adversely affect the ability of our customers to use our products. In addition, natural disasters and acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our or our customers' businesses, national economies or the world economy as a whole. In the event of a major disruption caused by a natural disaster or man - made problem, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our development activities, lengthy interruptions in service, breaches of data security and loss of critical data, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. In addition, as computer malware, viruses and computer hacking, fraudulent use attempts and phishing attacks have become more prevalent, we face increased risk from these activities to maintain the performance, reliability, security and availability of our subscription offerings and related services and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our customers, which may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers.. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock. The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock prior to the completion of our IPO, including our executive officers, employees and directors and their affiliates, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control.. Our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As a result, as of January 31, 2018, holders of our Class B common stock represented approximately 97% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and our directors, executive officers, and each of their affiliated entities, represented approximately 56% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. This concentrated control will limit the ability of holders of our Class A common stock to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future. For example, holders of our Class B common stock will be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval even when the shares of Class B common stock represent a small minority of all outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, including amendments of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, increases to the number of shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans or adoption of new equity incentive plans and approval of any merger or sale of assets for the foreseeable future. Holders of our Class B common stock may also have interests that differ from the interests of holders of our Class A common stock and may vote in a way with which holders of our Class A common stock may disagree and which may be adverse to such holders' interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock.. Future transfers by holders of our Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting into shares of our Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for tax or estate planning purposes. The conversion of shares of our Class B common stock into shares of our Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. For example, as of January 31, 2018, Kevin P. Ryan, Eliot Horowitz and Dwight Merriman represented approximately 20% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, and if they retain a significant portion of their holdings of our Class B common stock for an extended period of time, they could control a significant portion of the voting power of our capital stock for the foreseeable future. As board members, Messrs. Ryan and Horowitz each owe a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith and in a manner they each reasonably believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As stockholders, Messrs. Ryan, Horowitz and Merriman are entitled to vote their shares in their own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.. We cannot predict the impact our dual class structure may have on our stock price or our business.. We cannot predict whether our dual class structure, combined with the concentrated control of our stockholders who held our capital stock prior to the completion of our IPO, including our executive officers, employees and directors and their affiliates, will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock or in adverse publicity or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple - class share structures in certain of their indexes. In July 2017, FTSE Russell announced that it plans to require new constituents of its indexes to have greater than 5% of the company's voting rights in the hands of public stockholders, and S&P Dow Jones announced that it will no longer admit companies with multiple - class share structures to certain of its indexes. Because of our dual class structure, we will likely be excluded from these indexes and we cannot assure you that other stock indexes will not take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that. 32. Table of Contents. seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.. The trading price of our Class A common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile, which could cause the value of our Class A common stock to decline.. Technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. The trading price of our Class A common has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our Class A common stock include the following:. • announcements of new products or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;. • changes in how customers perceive the benefits of our product and future product offerings and releases;. • departures of key personnel;. • price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;. • fluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float;. • sales of large blocks of our Class A common stock;. • actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations;. • whether our results of operations meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;. • changes in actual or future expectations of investors or securities analysts;. • significant data breach involving our software;. • litigation involving us, our industry, or both;. • regulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries or both;. • general economic conditions and trends;. • major catastrophic events in our domestic and foreign markets; and. • \"flash crashes,\" \"freeze flashes\" or other glitches that disrupt trading on the securities exchange on which we are listed.. In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations or financial condition. The trading price of our Class A common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. In the past, following periods of volatility in the trading price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. If our stock price is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources from our business. This could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. If securities analysts or industry analysts were to downgrade our stock, publish negative research or reports or fail to publish reports about our business, our competitive position could suffer, and our stock price and trading volume could decline.. The trading market for our Class A common stock will, to some extent, depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our stock or publish negative research or reports, cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports about our business, our competitive position could suffer, and our stock price and trading volume could decline.. 33. Table of Contents. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales could occur, could reduce the price that our Class A common stock might otherwise attain.. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your Class A common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate.. We, our executive officers, directors and holders of a substantial majority of our common stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock are subject to lock - up agreements or market standoff provisions that restrict our and their ability to transfer any shares or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock for a period of 180 days from October 18, 2017. When the lock - up period in the lock - up agreements and market standoff provisions expires, we and our locked - up security holders will be able to sell our shares in the public market. In addition, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Barclays Capital Inc., on behalf of the underwriters, may release all or some portion of the shares subject to the lock - up agreements or market standoff provisions prior to the expiration of the lock - up period. Sales of a substantial number of such shares, or the perception that such sales may occur, upon expiration of, or early release of the securities subject to, the lock - up agreements or market standoff agreements, could cause our stock price to fall or make it more difficult for you to sell your Class A common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate.. As of January 31, 2018, there were an aggregate of 12,637,435 shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock subject to outstanding options and 245,746 shares of our Class A common stock subject to outstanding restricted stock units. We have registered all of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon, and issuable upon conversion of the shares of Class B common stock issuable upon, exercise of outstanding options and the settlement of restricted stock units and upon exercise or settlement of any options, restricted stock units or other equity incentives we may grant in the future, for public resale under the Securities Act. Accordingly, these shares may be freely sold in the public market upon issuance as permitted by any applicable vesting requirements, subject to the lock-up agreements and market standoff provisions described above. In addition, certain holders of shares of our capital stock may require us, subject to certain conditions, to file a registration statement covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. If we register the resale of these shares in the future, the holders could sell those shares freely in the public market, without regard to the limitations of Rule 144.. Our issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.. We expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We expect to grant equity awards to employees, directors and consultants under our equity incentive plans. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in companies, products or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our Class A common stock to decline.. We do not intend to pay dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future.. We have never declared or paid any dividends on our capital stock. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, investors in our Class A common stock may only receive a return if the market price of our Class A common stock increases.. We will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices.. As a public company, and particularly after we are no longer an \"emerging growth company,\" we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. The Sarbanes - Oxley Act, the Dodd - Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to compliance with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time - consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain directors' and officers' liability insurance, which could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we will incur as a public company or the timing of such costs.. 34. Table of Contents. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for:. • any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;. • any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;. • any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; and. • any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal - affairs doctrine.. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.. These exclusive - forum provisions may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees.

These provisions include:. • a classified Board of Directors with three - year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our Board of Directors;. • the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;. • the exclusive right of our Board of Directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our Board of Directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors;. • a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;. • the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by our Board of Directors, the chairperson of our Board of Directors, our chief executive officer or our president (in the absence of a chief executive officer), which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;. • the requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the management of our business (including our classified board structure) or certain provisions of our amended and restated bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;. 35. Table of Contents. • the ability of our Board of Directors to amend our bylaws, which may allow our Board of Directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend our bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;. • advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us; and. • the authorization of two classes of common stock, as discussed above.. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a specified period of time."
