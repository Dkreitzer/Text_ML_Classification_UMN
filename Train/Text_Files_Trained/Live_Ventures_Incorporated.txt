[1] "ITEM 1A.        Risk Factors. The following are certain risks that could affect our business and our results of operations. The risks identified below are not all encompassing but should be considered in establishing an opinion of our future operations.. 7. RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMPANY GENERALLY. Our results of operations could fluctuate due to factors outside of our control.. Our operating results have historically fluctuated significantly, and we could continue to experience fluctuations or revert to declining operating results due to factors that may or may not be within our control. Such factors include the following:. ·     fluctuating demand for our products and services, which may depend on a number of factors including:. ·     changes in economic conditions and our customers’ profitability, and the amount of     consumers’ discretionary spending,                               ·     changes in technologies favored by consumers,                               ·     customer refunds or cancellations, and                               ·     our ability to continue to bill through existing means;. ·     market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our services or products;. ·     price competition or pricing changes by us or our competitors;                                                    ·     new product offerings or other actions by our competitors;. ·     the amount and timing of expenditures for expansion of our operations, including the hiring of new employees, capital expenditure and related costs;. ·     technical difficulties or failures affecting our systems in general;. ·     the fixed nature of a significant amount of our operating expenses; and                                                    ·     the ability of our check processing service providers to continue to process and provide billing information.. If we do not effectively manage our growth and business, our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.. We have expanded our business over the past few years through the acquisition of different businesses in different industries and we intend to continue to acquire additional businesses (and possibly in different industries) in the future.  Significant expansion of our present operations will be required to capitalize on potential growth in market opportunities and will require us to add management personnel and upgrade our financial and management systems and controls and information technology infrastructure. Any  expansion will also place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources. In order to manage our growth, we will be required to continue to implement and improve our operational, marketing and financial systems, to expand existing operations, to attract and retain superior management and personnel, and to train, manage and expand our employee base. There is no assurance that we will be able to expand our operations effectively, our systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support our expanded operations, and our management may fail to implement our business plan successfully.. 8. We may not be able to secure additional capital to expand our existing operations.. Although we currently have no material long-term needs for capital expenditures at our existing operating subsidiaries, we will likely be required to make increased capital expenditures to fund our anticipated growth of operations, infrastructure, and personnel. In the future, we may need to seek additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity, depending upon our results of operations, market conditions or unforeseen needs or opportunities. Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including:. ·     the pace of expansion of our operations;. ·     our need to respond to competitive pressures; and. ·     future acquisitions of complementary products, technologies or businesses.. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that any financing arrangements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.. We may be exposed to litigation, claims and other legal proceedings relating to our company as a whole or our individual products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or our stock price.. In the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to a variety of product-related claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings, including those relating to product liability, product warranty, product recall, personal injury, intellectual property infringement and other matters and/or claims relating our Company including securities class action matters. A very large claim or several similar claims asserted by a large class of plaintiffs could have a material adverse effect on our business and cause our stock price to decline, if we are unable to successfully defend against or resolve these matters or if its insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy any judgments against us or settlements relating to these matters. Although we have product liability insurance, the policies may not provide coverage for certain claims against us or may not be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities. Further, we may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels. Moreover, adverse publicity arising from claims made against us, even if the claims are not successful, could adversely affect our reputation or the reputation and sales of our products and cause our stock price to decline.. We have identified and disclosed in this Form 10-K material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which have resulted in a restatement of our financial statements for fiscal year 2016.  If we are not able to remediate these material weaknesses and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial results, which could cause our stock price to fall or result in our stock being delisted.. We need to devote significant resources and time to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”) with respect to internal control over financial reporting. In addition, Section 404 under Sarbanes-Oxley requires that we assess the design and operating effectiveness of our controls over financial reporting, which are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports.. As reported in Part II – Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, there were material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting at September 30, 2017. Specifically, management’s assessment concluded that the company has the following material weaknesses: (a) lack of sufficient controls around the financial reporting process; (b) lack of proper segregation of duties within the financial reporting process; (c) lack of adequate controls surrounding management’s review of the income tax provision process; (d) lack of controls surrounding the assessment of certain cash flow and balance sheet classifications; and (e) lack of sufficient controls around the process for business combinations. These material weaknesses resulted in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the 2016 fiscal year, as set forth in Note 4, Reclassifications and Restatements, of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Form 10-K.. We expect our systems and controls to become increasingly complex to the extent that we integrate acquisitions and as our business grows. To effectively manage our company today and this anticipated complexity, we need to remediate these material weaknesses and continue to improve our operational, financial, and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. Any failure to remediate these material weaknesses and implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation or operation of these controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could adversely affect our business and jeopardize our listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market, either of which would harm our stock price.. 9. If we do not introduce new or enhanced offerings to our customers, we may be unable to attract and retain those customers, which would significantly impede our ability to generate revenue.. Our Marquis and Vintage Stock management teams actively evaluate and improve our marketing efforts and our product and service offerings, as well as contracts with new partners and hire and train personnel for management, sales and fulfillment. Any new product offering is subject to certain risks, including customer acceptance, competition, product differentiation, challenges relating to economies of scale and the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including management and designers. Many of our contracts with third party vendors, including our strategic partnerships, permit our partners to terminate the contract, with short or no prior notice, for convenience, as well as in the event we default under the terms of the contract for failing to meet our contractual obligations.. The development of new products involves considerable costs and any new product may not generate sufficient consumer interest and sales to become a profitable brand or to cover the costs of its development and subsequent promotions. There can be no assurance that Marquis, Vintage Stock or any of our other businesses will be able to develop and grow our current offerings, or any other new offerings, to a point where they will become profitable, or generate positive cash flow. We may modify or terminate our current product and services offerings if our management determines that they are not yielding or will not yield desired results.. Our product introductions and improvements, along with our other marketplace initiatives, are designed to capitalize on customer demands and trends. In order to be successful, we must anticipate and react to changes in these demands and trends, and to modify existing products or develop new products or processes to address them. Potential customers may not subscribe to our current offerings or other online marketing products and services that we may offer in the future, or may discontinue use if they find these products and services to be too costly, or ineffective for meeting their business needs than other methods of advertising and marketing. Our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations will be materially and adversely affected if we do not execute our strategy or our products and services are not adopted by a sufficient number of customers.. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.. Our success depends both on our internally developed technology and licensed third-party technology. We rely on a variety of trademarks, service marks, and designs to promote our brand names and identity. We also rely on a combination of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures, and trademark, copyright, trade secrecy, unfair competition, and other intellectual property laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our products and services. The steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our intellectual property and may not prevent our competitors from gaining access to our intellectual property and proprietary information. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that courts will always uphold our intellectual property rights or enforce the contractual arrangements that we have entered into to obtain and protect our proprietary technology.. Third parties, including our partners, contractors or employees, may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, and other proprietary rights. Any such infringement or misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights, which may result in the dilution of the brand identity of our services.. We may decide to initiate litigation in order to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights. Any such litigation could result in substantial expense, and may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our products or services infringe or misappropriate their intellectual property rights. Any such claim or litigation against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and harm our reputation. In addition, such claims or litigation could force us to do one or more of the following:. ·     cease selling or using any of our products and services that incorporate the subject intellectual property, which would adversely affect our revenue;. ·     attempt to obtain a license from the holder of the intellectual property right alleged to have been infringed or misappropriated, which license may not be available on reasonable terms; and. ·     attempt to redesign or, in the case of trademark claims, rename our products or services to avoid infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may be costly and time-consuming.. Even if we were to prevail, such claims or litigation could be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend, and could result in the diversion of our management’s time and attention. These expenses and diversion of managerial resources could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.. 10. We may be subject to intellectual property claims that create uncertainty about ownership or use of technology essential to our business and divert our managerial and other resources.. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. Third parties may, in the future, claim our current or future services, products, trademarks, technologies, business methods or processes infringe their intellectual property rights, or challenge the validity of our intellectual property rights. We may be subject to patent infringement claims or other intellectual property infringement claims that would be costly to defend and could limit our ability to use certain critical technologies or business methods. We may also become subject to interference proceedings conducted in the patent and trademark offices of various countries to determine the priority of inventions.. The defense and prosecution, if necessary, of intellectual property suits, interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can become very costly and may divert our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. We may not prevail in any of these suits or proceedings. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could require us to pay substantial compensatory and exemplary damages, could restrain us from using critical technologies, business methods or processes, and could result in us losing, or not gaining, valuable intellectual property rights.. Furthermore, due to the voluminous amount of discovery frequently conducted in connection with intellectual property litigation, some of our confidential information could be disclosed to competitors during this type of litigation. In addition, public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation could be perceived negatively by investors, and thus have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.. We may be required to expand or upgrade our infrastructure.. Our ability to provide high-quality services largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems. We (or our third-party service providers) may be required to expand or upgrade our (or their) technology, infrastructure, fulfillment capabilities, or customer support capabilities in order to accommodate any significant growth in customers or to replace aging or faulty equipment or technologies. We (or they) may not be able to project accurately the rate or timing of increases, if any, in the use of our services or expand and upgrade our (or their) systems and infrastructure to accommodate these increases in a timely manner.. Any expansion of our (or our third-party service providers’) infrastructure may require us (or them) to make significant upfront expenditures for servers, routers, computer equipment, and additional internet and intranet equipment, as well as to increase bandwidth for internet connectivity. Any such expansion or enhancement may cause system disruptions.. Our (or our third-party service providers’) inability to expand or upgrade our technology, infrastructure, fulfillment capabilities, customer support capabilities or equipment as required or without disruptions could impair the reputation of our brand and our services and diminish the attractiveness of our service offerings to our clients.. We depend upon third parties to provide certain services and software, and our business may suffer if the relationships upon which we depend fail to produce the expected benefits or are terminated.. We depend upon third-party software to operate certain of our services. The failure of this software to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, although we believe that several alternative sources for this software are available, any failure to obtain and maintain the rights to use such software could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. We also depend upon third parties who provide the cloud computing services which host our customers’ websites, including the mobile web apps, to be sufficiently reliable and provide sufficient capacity and bandwidth so that our business can function properly, and our customers’ websites are responsive to current and anticipated traffic. Any restrictions or interruption in those providers’ services or connection to the internet could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. If we are forced to switch hosting facilities, we may not be successful in finding an alternative service provider on acceptable terms or in hosting the required computer servers and implementing the required technology ourselves. We may also be limited in our remedies against these providers in the event of a failure of service.. Our business could be negatively impacted if the security of our or our partners’ equipment becomes compromised.. To the extent that our activities involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information about our customers or users, security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to minimize problems caused by security breaches. Our (or our third-party service providers’) security measures may not prevent security breaches. The failure to prevent these security breaches or a misappropriation of proprietary information may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.. 11. Tax matters, including the changes in corporate tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition.. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives. As a result of the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, corporate tax rates in the United States will decrease in 2018, which could result in changes in changes in the valuation of our deferred tax asset and liabilities. Any such change in valuation could have a material impact on our income tax expense and deferred tax balances.. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to our taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. There can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.. We also need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax laws and regulations. The enactment of or increases in tariffs, or other changes in the application or interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations.. Our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fires, tornados, floods and other natural catastrophic events and to interruption by man-made problems such as computer viruses or terrorism.. Our service systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, tornados, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins and similar events. For example, a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, tornado or flood, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition, and our insurance coverage will likely be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Our servers may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data or the unauthorized disclosure of confidential intellectual property or client data. We may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in certain circumstances, such as the tornado that struck Tulsa, Oklahoma in August 2017 and damaged one our stores in our Retail and Online business, and our business interruption insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Such disruptions could negatively impact our ability to operate our business, which could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY. We may not be able to identify, acquire or establish control of, or effectively integrate previously acquired businesses, which could materially adversely affect our growth.. As part of our business strategy, we intend to pursue a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of new businesses, as well as strategic investments and joint ventures. Although we regularly evaluate such opportunities, we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities, obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms or at all to fund such strategic transactions, to complete acquisitions and integrate acquired businesses with the our existing businesses, or to manage profitably acquired businesses or strategic investments.. The acquisition of a company or business is accompanied by a number of risks, including:. ·     failure of due diligence during the acquisition process;. ·     adverse short-term effects on reported operating results;. ·     the potential loss of key partners or key personnel in connection with, or as the result of, a transaction;. ·     the impairment of relationships with clients of the acquired business, or our own customers, partners or employees, as a result of any integration of operations or the expansion of our offerings;. ·     the recording of goodwill and intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges;. ·     the diversion of management’s time and resources;. ·     the risk of entering into markets or producing products where we have limited or no experience, including the integration or removal of the acquired or disposed products with or from our existing products; and. ·     the inability properly to implement or remediate internal controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at businesses that prior to our acquisition were not subject to federal securities laws and may have lacked appropriate controls, procedures and policies.. 12. The acquisition of new businesses is costly and such acquisitions may not enhance our financial condition.. Our growth strategy is to acquire companies and identify and acquire assets and technologies from companies in various industries that have a demonstrated history of strong earnings potential. The process to undertake a potential acquisition is time-consuming and costly. We expend significant resources to undertake business, financial and legal due diligence on our potential acquisition target and there is no guarantee that we will acquire the company after completing due diligence.. Our acquisitions could result in the use of substantial amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or convertible debt securities, significant amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets and exposure to undisclosed or potential liabilities of the acquired companies. To the extent that the goodwill arising from the acquisitions carried on the financial statements do not pass the annual goodwill impairment test, excess goodwill will be charged to, and reduce, future earnings.. Because we do not intend to use our own employees or members of management to run the daily operations at our acquired companies, business operations might be interrupted if employees at the acquired businesses were to resign.. As part of our acquisition strategy, we do not use our own employees or members of our management team to operate the acquired companies. Key management at these acquired companies has been in place for several years and has established solid relationships with their customers. Competition for executive-level personnel is strong and we can make no assurance that we will be able to retain these executive employees. Although we have entered into employment agreements with executive management and provide incentives to stay with the business after its been acquired, if such key persons were to resign, we might face impairment of relationships with remaining employees or customers, and might cause long-term customers to terminate their relationships with the acquired companies, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. RISKS RELATED TO OUR FLOORING MANUFACTURING BUSINESS. The floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, such as consumer confidence and income, corporate and government spending, interest rate levels, availability of credit and demand for housing. Significant or prolonged declines in the U.S. or global economies could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.. Downturns in the U.S. and global economies, along with the residential and commercial markets in such economies, negatively impact the floor covering industry and our flooring manufacturing business. Although the difficult economic conditions have improved in the U.S., there may be additional downturns that could cause the industry to deteriorate in the foreseeable future. A significant or prolonged decline in residential or commercial remodeling or new construction activity could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We may be unable to predict customer preferences or demand accurately, or to respond to technological developments.. We operate in a market sector where demand is strongly influenced by rapidly changing customer preferences as to product design and technical features. Failure to quickly and effectively respond to changing customer demand or technological developments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We face intense competition in the flooring industry that could decrease demand for our products or force us to lower prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.. The floor covering industry is highly competitive. We face competition from a number of manufacturers and independent distributors. Maintaining our competitive position may require substantial investments in the out-product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing activities. Competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for our products or force us to lower prices. Moreover, a strong U.S. dollar combined with lower fuel costs may contribute to more attractive pricing for imports that compete with our products, which may put pressure on our pricing. The occurrence of one or more of these factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. 13. In periods of rising costs, we may be unable to pass raw materials, energy and fuel-related cost increases on to its customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.. The prices of raw materials and fuel-related costs vary significantly with market conditions. Although we generally attempt to pass on increases in raw material, energy and fuel-related costs to our customers, our ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase, competitive pressures and market conditions for our products. There have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered. During such periods of time, the occurrence of such events may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. RISKS RELATED TO OUR RETAIL AND ONLINE BUSINESS. Economic conditions in the U.S. could adversely affect demand for the products we sell.. Sales of our products involve discretionary spending by consumers. Consumers are typically more likely to make discretionary purchases, including purchasing movies, games, music and other discretionary products when there are favorable economic conditions. Consumer spending may be affected by many economic factors outside of our control. Some of these factors include consumer disposable income levels, consumer confidence in current and future economic conditions, levels of employment, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, inflation, political conditions and the effect of weather, natural disasters, and civil disturbances. These and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products, which may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.. The video game industry is cyclical and affected by the introduction of next-generation consoles, which could negatively impact the demand for existing products or our pre-owned business.. The video game industry has been cyclical in nature in response to the introduction and maturation of new technology. Following the introduction of new video game platforms, sales of these platforms and related software and accessories generally increase due to initial demand, while sales of older platforms and related products generally decrease as customers migrate toward the new platforms. A new console cycle began when Nintendo launched the Wii U in November 2012 and Sony and Microsoft each launched their next generation of consoles, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, respectively, in November 2013. If the new video game platforms do not continue to be successful, our sales of video game products could decline. The introduction of these next-generation consoles could negatively impact the demand for existing products or our pre-owned business, which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and liquidity.. Technological advances in the delivery and types of video, video games and PC entertainment software, as well as changes in consumer behavior related to these new technologies, could lower our sales. While it is currently possible to download video, video game content and music to the current generation of video and gaming systems, downloading is somewhat constrained by bandwidth capacity and video game and movie file sizes. However, broadband speeds are increasing and downloading technology is becoming more prevalent and continues to evolve rapidly. The current game consoles from Sony and Microsoft have facilitated download technology. If these consoles and other advances in technology continue to expand our customers’ ability to access and download the current format of video, music and games and incremental content from their games and videos through these and other sources, our customers may no longer choose to purchase videos, DVDs, video games and music in our stores or reduce their purchases in favor of other forms of video, digital and game delivery. As a result, our sales and earnings could decline.. We may not compete effectively as browser, mobile and social video viewing and gaming becomes more popular.. Listening to music, gaming and viewing video and digital content continues to evolve rapidly. The popularity of browser, mobile and social viewing and gaming have increased greatly and this popularity is expected to continue to grow. Browser, mobile and social video viewing, listening to music and gaming is accessed through hardware other than the game consoles and traditional hand-held video and game devices we currently sell. If there is continued growth in popularity of browser, mobile and social viewing and gaming, our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be impacted negatively.. 14. Sales of video games containing graphic violence may decrease as a result of actual violent events or other reasons, and our financial results may be adversely affected as a result.. Many popular video games contain material with graphic violence. These games receive an “M” or “T” rating from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board. As actual violent events occur and are publicized, or for other reasons, public acceptance of graphic violence in video games may decline. Consumer advocacy groups may increase their efforts to oppose sales of graphically-violent video games and may seek legislation prohibiting their sales. As a result, our sales of those games may decrease, which could negatively impact our results of operations.. As a seller of certain consumer products, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations, and statutes related to product safety and consumer protection.. While we take steps to comply with these laws, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance, and failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We may also be subject to involuntary or voluntary product recalls or product liability lawsuits. Direct costs or reputational damage associated with product recalls or product liability lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, could have a negative impact on future revenues and results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.. International events could delay or prevent the delivery of products to our suppliers. Some of our suppliers rely on foreign sources, primarily in Asia, to manufacture a portion of the products we purchase from them. As a result, any event causing a disruption of imports, including natural disasters or the imposition of import restrictions or trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas, could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us, which could lower our sales and profitability.. If we are unable to renew or enter into new leases on favorable terms, our revenue growth may decline.. All of our retail stores are located in leased premises. If the cost of leasing existing stores increases, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our existing store locations as leases expire. In addition, we may not be able to enter into new leases on favorable terms or at all, or we may not be able to locate suitable alternative sites or additional sites for new store expansion in a timely manner. Our revenues and earnings may decline if we fail to maintain existing store locations, enter into new leases, locate alternative sites or find additional sites for new store expansion.. An adverse trend in sales during the holiday selling season could impact our financial results.. Our retail business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with a major portion of our sales and operating profit realized during the first fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. Any adverse trend in sales during the holiday selling season could lower our results of operations for the first fiscal quarter and the entire fiscal year.. Our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.. Our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon several factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:. ·     the timing and allocations of new product releases;. ·     the timing of new store openings or closings;. ·     shifts in the timing or content or certain promotions or service offerings;. ·     the effect of changes in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we are operating;. ·     acquisition costs and the integration of companies we acquire or invest in; and. ·     the costs associated with the exit of unprofitable markets or stores.. These and other factors could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, cash flows and liquidity, and this makes the prediction of our financial results on a quarterly basis difficult. Also, it is possible that our quarterly financial results may be below the expectations of public market analysts.. 15. Failure to effectively manage our new store openings could lower our sales and profitability.. Our growth strategy depends in part upon opening new stores and operating them profitably. Our ability to open new stores and operate them profitability depends upon a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control. These factors include the ability to:. ·     identify new store locations, negotiate suitable leases and build out the stores in a timely and cost efficient manner;. ·     hire and train skilled associates;. ·     integrate new stores into our existing operations; and. ·     increase sales at new store locations.. If we fail to manage new store openings in a timely and cost-efficient manner, our growth or profits may decrease.. If our management information systems fail to perform or are inadequate, our ability to manage our business could be disrupted.. We rely on computerized inventory and management systems to coordinate and manage the activities in our stores and distribution centers. We use inventory replenishment systems to track sales and inventory. Our ability to rapidly process incoming shipments of new products and deliver them to all of our stores, enables us to meet peak demand and replenish stores to keep our stores in stock at optimum levels and to move inventory efficiently. If our inventory or management information systems fail to adequately perform these functions, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, if operations in any of our distribution centers were to shut down or be disrupted for a prolonged period of time of if these centers were unable to accommodate the continued store growth in a particular region, our business would suffer.. Data breaches involving customer or employee data stored by us could adversely affect our reputation and revenues.. We store confidential information with respect to our customers and employees. A compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses with which we interact could result in information related to our customers or employees being obtained by unauthorized persons. Any such breach of our systems could lead to fraudulent activity resulting in claims and lawsuits against us or other operational problems or interruptions in connection with such breaches. Any breach or unauthorized access in the future could result in significant legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. While we also seek to obtain assurances that others with whom we interact will protect confidential information, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by others may be compromised. If a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, cash flows and liquidity and possibly, subject us to additional legal, regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace.. Also, the interpretation and enforcement of data protection laws in the United States are uncertain and, in certain circumstances contradictory. These laws may be interpreted and enforced in a manner that is inconsistent with our policies and practices. If we are subject to data security breaches or government-imposed fines, we may have a loss in sales or be forced to pay damages or other amounts, which could adversely affect profitability, or be subject to substantial costs related to compliance.. 16. We may record future goodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges which could negatively impact our future results of operations and financial condition.. In our most current reporting period we have recorded significant goodwill as a result of our acquisition of Vintage Stock because we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. We also have long-lived assets consisting of property and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets which we review both on an annual basis as well as when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If a determination is made that a significant impairment in value of goodwill, other intangible assets or long-lived assets has occurred, such determination could require us to impair a substantial portion of our assets. Asset impairments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. Because of our floating rate credit facilities, we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes.. Our financial position may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates, as our floating rate credit facilities are subject to floating interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. If we were to borrow against our float rate credit facilities, a significant increase in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. RISKS RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES. The trading price of our common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.. The trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile over the past few years and investors could experience losses in response to factors including the following, many of which are beyond our control:. ·     variations in our operating results;. ·     changes in expectations of our future financial performance, including financial estimates by investors;. ·     our failure to meet investors’ expectations;. ·     announcement by us of significant acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;                                                                         ·     announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings, including                                 securities class action claims, against us;                                        ·     the size of our public float;. ·     changes in senior management or key personnel;. ·     future sales of our debt or equity securities, including common stock; and                                        ·     general domestic and international economic conditions.. Domestic and international stock markets often experience significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies with securities trading in those markets. These fluctuations, as well as political events, terrorist attacks, threatened or actual war, and general economic conditions unrelated to our performance, may adversely affect the price of our common stock. In the past, securities holders of other companies often have initiated securities class action litigation against those companies following periods of volatility in the market price of those companies’ securities. If the market price of our stock fluctuates and our stockholders initiate this type of litigation, we could incur substantial costs and experience a diversion of our management’s attention and resources, regardless of the outcome. This could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.. 17. Due to our concentrated stock ownership, public stockholders may have no effective voice in our management and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected.. Isaac Capital Group LLC (ICG) is the beneficial owner of approximately 49.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Jon Isaac, our President and CEO, is the President and sole member of ICG and accordingly has the sole power to vote the shares of our common stock owned by ICG, and as a result, is able to exercise significant influence over all matters that require us to obtain shareholder approval, including the election of directors to our board and approval of significant corporate transactions that we may consider, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. Moreover, such a concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us at a premium. This significant concentration of share ownership may also adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with concentrated stock ownership.. Because we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your shares of common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.. We may retain future earnings, if any, for future operation, expansion, and debt repayment and, with the exception of dividends payable to our series E preferred stockholders, we have no current plans to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. Therefore, any return on your investment would likely come only from an increase in the market value of our common stock.  As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.. Certain provisions of Nevada law, in our organizational documents and in contracts to which we are party may prevent or delay a change of control of our company.. We are subject to the Nevada anti-takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers. These anti-takeover laws prevent Nevada corporations from engaging in a merger, consolidation, sales of its stock or assets, and certain other transactions with any stockholder, including all affiliates and associates of the stockholder, who owns 10% or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock, for three years following the date that the stockholder acquired 10% or more of the corporation’s voting stock, except in certain situations. In addition, our amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws include a number of provisions that may deter or impede hostile takeovers or changes of control or management. These provisions include the following:. ·     the authority of our Board of Directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, and privileges of these shares, without stockholder approval;. ·     stockholders must comply with advance notice requirements to transact any business at the annual meeting;. ·     all stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called meeting of stockholders and not by written consent, unless such action or proposal is first approved by our Board of Directors;. ·     special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, or the President of our company;. ·     a director may be removed from office only for cause by the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power entitled to vote at an election of directors;. ·     our Board of Directors is expressly authorized to alter, amend or repeal our bylaws;. ·     newly-created directorships and vacancies on our Board of Directors may only be filled by a majority of remaining directors, and not by our stockholders; and. ·     cumulative voting is not allowed in the election of our directors.. 18. These provisions of Nevada law and our articles and bylaws could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change of control of our company and may discourage attempts by other companies to acquire us, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders.. If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish unfavorable commentary about us or our industry or downgrade our common stock, the trading price of our common stock could decline.. We expect that the trading price for our common stock will be affected by any research or reports that securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who may elect to cover us or our business downgrade their evaluations of our common stock, the price of our common stock would likely decline. We may be unable or slow to attract research coverage and if one or more analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market for our common stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline."
