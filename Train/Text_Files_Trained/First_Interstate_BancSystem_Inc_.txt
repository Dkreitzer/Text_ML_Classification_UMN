[1] "Item 1A.  Risk Factors. Like other financial and bank holding companies, we are subject to a number of risks, many of which are outside of our control. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed. These risks are not the only ones that we may face. Other risks of which we are not aware, including those which relate to the banking and financial services industry in general and us in particular, or those which we do not currently believe are material, may harm our future business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. You should consider carefully the following important factors in evaluating us, our business and an investment in our securities.. Risks Relating to the Market and Our Business. A decline in economic conditions could reduce demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.. Our customers are located predominantly in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, and Wyoming. Our profitability largely depends on the general economic conditions in these areas.. Deterioration in economic conditions could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations:. • demand for our products and services may decline;. • loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase;. • collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value;. • future borrowing power of our customers may be reduced;. • the value of our securities portfolio may decline; and. • the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us.. Additionally, a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment, or other economic and geopolitical factors beyond our control, could further impact these local economic conditions and negatively affect our business and results of operations.. Deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could also have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. We are subject to lending risks.. We take on credit risk by virtue of making loans and extending loan commitments and letters of credit. Our credit standards, procedures and policies may not prevent us from incurring substantial credit losses, particularly in light of market developments.. 11. Table of Contents. While our loan portfolio is diversified across business sectors, it is concentrated in commercial real estate and commercial business loans. As of December 31, 2017, we had $4.0 billion of commercial loans, including $2.8 billion of commercial real estate loans, representing approximately 52.6% of our total loan portfolio. These loans may involve greater risks than other types of lending. Because payments on such loans are often dependent on the successful operation or development of the property or business involved, repayment of such loans is more sensitive than other types of loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy. Commercial loans typically are made on the basis of the borrowers' ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the commercial venture. If the cash flow from business operations is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Due to the larger average size of each commercial loan as compared with other loans, as well as the collateral that is generally less readily-marketable, losses incurred on commercial loans could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. In addition, at December 31, 2017, we had $2.4 billion of agricultural, construction, residential and other real estate loans, representing approximately 31.6% of our total loan portfolio. Deterioration in economic conditions or in the real estate market could result in increased delinquencies and foreclosures and could have an adverse effect on the collateral value for many of these loans and on the repayment ability of many of our borrowers. Deterioration in economic conditions or in the real estate market could also reduce the number of loans we make to businesses in the construction and real estate industry, which could negatively impact our interest income and results of operations. Similarly, the occurrence of a natural or manmade disaster in our market areas could impair the value of the collateral we hold for real estate secured loans. Any one or a combination of the factors identified above could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.. Changes in interest rates may have an adverse effect on demand for our products and services and our profitability.. Our earnings and financial condition are largely dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. The narrowing of interest rate spreads could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. We cannot control or predict with certainty changes in interest rates. Regional and local economic conditions, competitive pressures and the policies of regulatory authorities, including monetary policies of the Federal Open Market Committee, affect interest income and interest expense. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also adversely affect (1) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (2) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, including mortgage servicing rights, (3) our ability to realize gains on the sale of assets and (4) the average duration of our mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations portfolios.  For example, rising interest rates could adversely affect our mortgage banking business because higher interest rates could cause customers to apply for fewer mortgages. Similarly, rising interest rates would increase the required periodic payment for variable rate loans and may result an increase in non-performing loans. Additionally, rising interest rates may increase the cost of our deposits, which are a primary source of funding. Any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.. Our acquisitions, including our recent acquisition of Cascade Bancorp, and the integration of acquired businesses subject us to various risks and may not result in all of the cost savings and benefits anticipated, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.. We have in the past, and may in the future, seek to grow our business by acquiring other businesses. In May 2017, we completed our acquisition of Cascade Bancorp.  In August 2017, we performed system conversion and integration of the Bank of the Cascades. There is risk that our acquisitions may not have the anticipated positive results, including results relating to: correctly assessing the asset quality of the assets being acquired; the total cost and time required to complete the integration successfully; being able to profitably deploy funds acquired in an acquisition; or the overall performance of the combined entity.. Acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that could cause customers to remove their accounts from us and move their business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that the integration process related to acquisitions could result in the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, and employees. The loss of key employees in connection with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business. Acquisition and integration efforts could divert management attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the operation of the acquired branches may adversely affect our existing profitability, and we may not be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by the existing banking business or manage growth resulting from the acquisition effectively.. 12. Table of Contents. If we experience loan losses in excess of estimated amounts, our earnings could be adversely affected.. The risk of credit losses on loans varies with, among other things, general economic conditions, the composition of our loan portfolio, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and, in the case of a collateralized loan, the value and marketability of the collateral for the loan. We maintain an allowance for loan losses based upon, among other things, historical experience, delinquency trends, economic conditions, and regular reviews of loan portfolio quality. Based upon such factors, management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectability of our loan portfolio and provides an allowance for loan losses. These assumptions and judgments are complex and difficult to determine given the significant uncertainty surrounding future conditions in the general economy and banking industry. If management's assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect and the allowance for loan losses is inadequate, or if banking authorities or regulations require us to increase the allowance for loan losses, our net income may be adversely affected. As a result, an increase in loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.. Additional regulatory requirements imposed upon us as a result of our assets exceeding $10 billion could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.. The Dodd-Frank Act, and its implementing regulations, may result in lower revenues, higher costs and ratings downgrades. In addition, failure to meet the Federal Reserve's capital planning, adequacy, and liquidity requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act and other banking laws may limit the ability to pay dividends, pursue acquisitions, and repurchase common stock. As of June 30, 2017, we had our first quarter with over $10 billion in total consolidated assets, thus are subject to the heightened regulatory requirements as outlined in the Dodd-Frank Act. Many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act could have a direct effect on our performance and adversely affect our financial condition, as discussed by examples below:. • Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") Supervisory Authority. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority to implement new consumer protection rules and regulations, including the authority to prohibit \"unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices.\" The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and bank holding companies with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, and accordingly, assumes examination and enforcement authority over us.. Various rules promulgated by the CFPB, and interpretations of pre-existing statutes and rules by the CFPB, could negatively affect our business and financial condition.  For example, the CFPB has finalized a number of significant rules that impact nearly every aspect of the lifecycle of a residential mortgage. These rules implement the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. These rules have a direct impact on the Company's operations, as the Company is both a mortgage originator and a servicer.. • The Durbin Amendment. The Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction, a 1 cent fraud prevention adjustment, and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. As a result, we can expect our future annual interchange revenue to decline by approximately $11.5 million. This rule applies to us July 1, 2018; as such we expect a negative impact of approximately $5.8 million in the second half of 2018.. • Changes to Deposit Insurance Assessments. The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments and assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity capital of a financial institution. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established 1.35% as the minimum DIF reserve ratio and has adopted a plan under which it will meet the statutory minimum fund reserve ratio of 1.35% by September 30, 2020. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with assets less than $10 billion of the increase in the statutory minimum fund reserve ratio to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15%. Due to our asset size, we will no longer be entitled to benefit from the historical offset we have received. Any additional future premium increases or special assessments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. • Annual stress tests. We will be required to conduct annual stress tests to determine whether our capital planning assessment of our capital adequacy and our risk management practices adequately protect us and our affiliates in the event of an economic downturn. The results of the annual stress tests are reported to the Federal Reserve Board, and must be considered as part of the Company's capital planning and risk management practices. Compliance with the annual stress testing requirements, part of which must be publicly disclosed, may be misinterpreted by the market generally or our customers and, as a result, may adversely affect our stock price, ability to retain our customers, or compete for new business opportunities.. 13. Table of Contents. The Company cannot predict the additional effects and overall cost of compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act, regulations promulgated under the Act, or interpretations of other regulations by the CFPB will have on the Company's businesses or its ability to pursue future business opportunities as a result of our increased asset size. Additional regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may necessitate that we hire additional compliance or other personnel, design and implement additional internal controls, engage external consultants or incur other significant expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.. Loss of deposits or a change in mix could increase the Company's funding costs.. Deposits are a low cost and stable source of funding. We depend on checking and savings, negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW), and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits as our primary source of funding. The availability of internet banking products has increased the mobility of customer deposits. We compete with banks and other financial institutions for deposits. Funding costs may increase because the Company may lose deposits and replace them with more expensive sources of funding. Customers may shift their deposits into higher cost products or the Company may need to raise its interest rates to avoid losing deposits. Higher funding costs reduce the Company's net interest income and net income.. We may be adversely affected by declining oil and gas prices, and declining demand for coal.. Oil and gas drilling and production in Wyoming and in the Bakken Formation in Montana and North Dakota have been important contributors to our region's economic growth over the years. As of December 31, 2017, our direct exposure to the oil and gas industry was approximately $75.6 million in outstanding loans, including approximately $57.9 million advanced to oil and gas service companies. As of December 31, 2017, we also had commitments to lend an additional $17.7 million to oil and gas borrowers. These borrowers may be significantly affected by volatility in oil and gas prices and declines in the level of drilling and production activity. A prolonged period of low oil and gas prices or other events that result in a decline in drilling activity could have a negative impact on the economies of our market areas and on our customers. We carefully monitor the impact of volatility in oil and gas prices on our loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2017, 67.6% of our outstanding oil and gas loans were criticized.. Additionally, adverse developments in the demand for coal due to tightening environmental regulations, the suspension of new coal leasing on federal lands, slower growth in electricity demand and fuel competition from low natural gas prices, may impact the economies of the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming.. Adverse developments in the energy sector could have spillover effects on the broader economies of our market areas, including commercial and residential real estate values and the general level of economic activity. The State of Wyoming derives a significant portion of its operating budget from energy extraction and related industries. As such, reductions in oil, gas and coal related revenues may have additional negative economic implications for the State of Wyoming. There is no assurance that our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will not be adversely impacted by increases in non-performing oil and gas loans, or by the direct and indirect effects of current and future conditions in the energy industry.. Our goodwill may become impaired, which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.. The excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets from acquisitions, or goodwill, is evaluated for impairment at least annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is likely an impairment has occurred. In testing for impairment, the fair value of net assets is estimated based on analyses of our market value, discounted cash flows and peer values. Consequently, the determination of the fair value of goodwill is sensitive to market-based economics and other key assumptions. Variability in market conditions or in key assumptions could result in impairment of goodwill, which is recorded as a non-cash adjustment to income. An impairment of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2017, we had goodwill of $444.7 million, or 31.2% of our total stockholders' equity.. Changes in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements.. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. For example, the FASB issued amendments to its guidance on the credit impairment of financial instruments. The amendments, which will be effective for our first fiscal year after December 15, 2019, would introduce a new impairment model based on current expected credit losses, or CECL rather than incurred losses. The CECL model would apply to most debt instruments, including loan receivables and loan commitments. The amendment may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and may greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses.. 14. Table of Contents. We are dependent upon the services of our management team and directors.. Our future success and profitability is substantially dependent upon the management skills of our executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with us for many years. We do not currently have employment agreements or non-competition agreements with any of our key executives, other than an employment agreement with our president and chief executive officer, Kevin P. Riley. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy. We may not be successful in retaining key employees or finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of key employee loss or unavailability.. We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees to operate our business effectively.. As a result of low unemployment rates in our historical footprint and the Northwest region, there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in our markets. It may be difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees at all management and staffing levels. Failure to attract and retain employees and maintain adequate staffing of qualified personnel could adversely impact our operations and our ability to execute our business strategy. Furthermore, relatively low unemployment rates may lead to significant increases in salaries, wages and employee benefits expenses as we compete for qualified and skilled employees, which could negatively impact our results of operations and prospects.. Changes in new governmental regulation and new or changes in existing regulation could have a material adverse effect on the Company.. The Company is extensively regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the DIF and the banking system as a whole. Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which our business is subject have increased in recent years, in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations, most of which are now in place. The President of the United States of America has issued an executive order that sets forth principles for the reform of the federal financial regulatory framework and the republican majority in Congress has also suggested an agenda for financial regulatory change. It is too early to assess whether there will be any major changes in the regulatory environment or merely a rebalancing of the post financial crisis framework. The Company expects its business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision.. Regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, employment, monetary and other laws and regulations, rules, standards, policies and interpretations control the methods by which we conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance and govern financial reporting and disclosures. In addition, the Company is subject to changes in federal and state laws as well as changes in banking and credit regulations and governmental economic and monetary policies. The regulatory environment for financial institutions entails significant potential increases in compliance requirements and associated costs, including those related to consumer credit, with a focus on mortgage lending. Any regulatory changes could adversely and materially affect the Company.. We are subject to more stringent capital requirements.. Federal and state banking regulators also possess broad powers to take supervisory actions as they deem appropriate. These supervisory actions may result in higher capital requirements, higher deposit insurance premiums and limitations on the Company's activities that could have a material adverse effect on its business and profitability. For example, in July 2013, the FDIC and the federal banking agencies approved a new rule that substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us. The final rule implements the \"Basel III\" regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.. The final rule included minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective for us on January 1, 2015, and refined the definition of what constitutes \"capital\" for calculating these ratios. The rule required unrealized gains and losses on certain \"available-for-sale\" securities holdings to be included for calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-out is exercised. In addition, the final rule established a \"capital conservation buffer\" that, once fully phased in and combined with established minimum common equity, risk based assets capital, and total capital ratios, will exceed the prompt corrective action \"well-capitalized\" thresholds. (According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, a depository institution is \"well-capitalized\" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater; a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater; a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater; and is not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.). 15. Table of Contents. Phase in of the new capital conservation buffer requirement began in January 2016 and will increase each year until fully implemented by January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.. The table below compares minimum required capital ratios and the well-capitalized minimums to current actual ratios for the Company and the Bank on a transitional phase-in basis as of December 31, 2017. The well-capitalized standard for the Company is from Regulation Y and the well-capitalized standard for the Bank is from Prompt Corrective Action, or PCA, regulations.. Well-Capitalized Minimums       Minimum Regulatory Minimum Ratio + Capital            Capital Ratio Conservation Buffer For the Company For the Bank The Company The Bank Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio 4.50% 5.75% N/A 6.50% 11.04% 11.46% Tier 1 Capital Ratio 6.00% 7.25% 6.00% 8.00% 11.93% 11.46% Total Capital Ratio 8.00% 9.25% 10.00% 10.00% 12.76% 12.29% Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 4.00% N/A N/A 5.00% 8.86% 8.48%. Our Company faces cybersecurity risks, including \"denial-of-service attacks,\" \"hacking\" and \"identity theft\" that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation and create significant legal and financial exposure.. Our computer systems and network infrastructure are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities, or identity theft. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses, malware, cyber-attacks, and other means. Denial-of-service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions, primarily resulting in inconvenience. Future cyber-attacks could be disruptive and damaging. Hacking and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm to the Company.. In addition, we provide our customers with the ability to bank remotely, including online, through their mobile device and over the telephone. The secure transmission of confidential information over the internet and other remote channels is a critical element of remote banking. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other internal and external security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation, and other possible liabilities.. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks, nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications.. Further, targeted social engineering attacks may be sophisticated and difficult to prevent and our employees, customers or other users of our systems may be fraudulently induced to disclose sensitive information, allowing cyber criminals to gain access to our data or data of our customers.. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to our computers or systems or to those of our customers and counterparties. A successful security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.. 16. Table of Contents. We are subject to liquidity risks.. Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. Our liquidity is used to make loans and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers. Potential alternative sources of liquidity include federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements. We maintain a portfolio of investment securities and hold overnight funds that may be used as a secondary source of liquidity to the extent the securities are not pledged for collateral. Other potential sources of liquidity include the sale of loans, the utilization of available government and regulatory assistance programs, the ability to acquire brokered deposits, the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as Federal Home Loan Bank advances, the issuance of debt or equity securities and borrowings through the Federal Reserve's discount window. Without sufficient liquidity from these potential sources, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers.. Additionally, our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors specific to us, the financial services industry or the economy in general. Factors that could reduce our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in our local or national economies, difficult or illiquid credit markets or adverse regulatory actions against us. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our regulatory standing, business, financial condition, and results of operations.. The Company may not be able to complete future acquisitions, or grow organically or through acquisitions.. Historically, the Company has expanded through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. If market and regulatory conditions were to become challenging, the Company may be unable to grow organically or successfully complete or integrate potential future acquisitions. The Company has historically used its strong stock currency to complete acquisitions. Downturns in the stock market and the Company's stock could have an impact on future acquisitions. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company can successfully complete such transactions, since they are subject to regulatory review and approval.. Costs associated with repossessed properties, including environmental remediation, may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.. A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties serving as collateral for certain loans. There are significant costs associated with our ownership of these properties including, but not limited to, personnel costs, taxes and insurance, completion and repair costs, and valuation adjustments. Additionally, we may experience unfavorable pricing in connection with our disposition of foreclosed properties. These costs, along with unfavorable pricing upon disposition, may adversely affect our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.. If hazardous or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property's value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.. Our systems of internal operating controls may not be effective.. We establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide us with critical information used to manage our business. These systems are subject to various inherent limitations, including cost, judgments used in decision-making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error and the risk of fraud. Moreover, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or processes and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. Because of these limitations, any system of internal operating controls may not be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management. From time to time, control deficiencies and losses from operational malfunctions or fraud have occurred and may occur in the future. Any future deficiencies, weaknesses or losses related to internal operating control systems could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.. 17. Table of Contents. The Company may experience significant competition from new or existing competitors, which may reduce its customer base or cause it to lower prices for its products and services in order to maintain market share.. There is intense competition among banks in the Company's market area. In addition, the Company competes with other providers of financial services, such as savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, securities firms, insurance companies, commercial finance and leasing companies, factoring companies, the mutual funds industry, fin-tech companies, full-service brokerage firms, and discount brokerage firms, some of which are subject to less extensive regulations than us with respect to the products and services they provide. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and customer expectations. There is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. Lower prices can reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our fee-based products and services.. In addition, the adoption of new technologies by competitors, including internet banking services, mobile applications and advanced ATM functionality could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services. Also, these and other capital investments in our business may not produce expected growth in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure. The Company may not be successful in introducing new products and services, achieving market acceptance of its products and services, anticipating or reacting to consumers' changing technological preferences or developing and maintaining loyal customers. In addition, we could lose market share to the shadow banking system or other non-traditional banking organizations.. Some of our larger competitors may have greater capital and resources than the Company, may have higher lending limits and may offer products and services not offered by us. Any potential adverse reactions to our financial condition or status in the marketplace, as compared to its competitors, could limit our ability to attract and retain customers and to compete for new business opportunities. The inability to attract and retain customers or to effectively compete for new business may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. The Company also experiences competition from nonbank companies inside and outside of its market area and, in some cases, from companies other than those traditionally considered financial sector participants. In particular, technology companies have begun to focus on the financial sector and offer software and products primarily over the Internet, with an increasing focus on mobile device delivery. These companies generally are not subject to regulatory requirements comparable to those to which financial institutions are subject, and may accordingly realize certain cost savings and offer products and services at more favorable rates and with greater convenience to the customer. For example, a number of companies offer bill pay and funds transfer services that allow customers to avoid using a bank. Technology companies are generally positioned and structured to quickly adapt to technological advances and directly focus resources on implementing those advances. This competition could result in the loss of fee income and customer deposits and related income. In addition, changes in consumer spending and saving habits could adversely affect our operations, and the Company may be unable to develop competitive and timely new products and services in response. As the pace of technology and change advance, continuous innovation is expected to exert long-term pressure on the financial services industry.. The Company relies on other companies to provide certain key components of its business infrastructure.. We are reliant upon certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations and we outsource many of our major systems, such as certain data processing, loan servicing and deposit processing systems. While the Company has selected these external vendors and systems carefully, and continues to manage and oversee these vendors, it does not control their operations. Failure of certain external vendors or systems to perform or provide services in accordance with contractual arrangements could be disruptive to our operations and limit our ability to provide certain products and services demanded by our customers. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience disruptions if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or disruption could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability. Any of the failures or disruptions mentioned above, could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.. The resolution of litigation, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular period.. We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remains high. Legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause harm to our reputation, which in turn could adversely impact our business prospects.. 18. Table of Contents. Additionally, some of the services we provide, such as trust and investment services, require us to act as fiduciaries for our customers and others. From time to time, third parties may make claims and take legal action against us pertaining to the performance of our fiduciary responsibilities. If these claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, we may be exposed to significant financial liability and/or our reputation could be damaged. Either of these results may adversely impact demand for our products and services or otherwise have a harmful effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. We may not effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers.. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to perform more efficiently. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to use technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customers' demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.. The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company.. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties. For example, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to increased credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client.. Our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, fires, and other natural catastrophic events.. A major catastrophe, such as an earthquake, tsunami, flood, fire, winter storms, or other natural disaster could adversely affect our financial condition or result in a prolonged interruption of our business. We have operations and customers in the Northwest, a geographical region that has been or may be affected by earthquake, volcano, tsunami, and flooding activity, which could be adversely impacted by these natural disasters or other severe weather in the region. Unpredictable natural and other disasters could have an adverse effect on the Company in that such events could materially disrupt our operations or the ability or willingness of our customers to access the financial services offered by the Company. These events could reduce our earnings and cause volatility in its financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or results of operations and prospects.. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock. Volatility in the price and volume of our stock may be unfavorable.. The market price of our Class A common stock is volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:. • prevailing market conditions;. • our historical performance and capital structure;. • estimates of our business potential and earnings prospects;. • an overall assessment of our management;. • conversion by our Class B shareholders of their shares into Class A common stock to liquidate their holdings;. • our performance relative to our peers;. • market demand for our shares;. • perceptions of the banking industry in general;. • political influences on investor sentiment; and. • consumer confidence.. 19. Table of Contents. At times the stock markets, including the NASDAQ Stock Market, on which our Class A common stock is listed, may experience significant price and volume fluctuations. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock is likely to be similarly volatile and investors in our Class A common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. Further, because our Class B common stock is convertible on a share-for-share basis into Class A common stock and the share price of our Class B common stock is based upon the share price of our Class A common stock, our Class B stock price is similarly impacted by the factors affecting our Class A common stock.. In addition, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources.. Our dividend policy, or our ability to pay dividends, may change.. We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiary Bank. Since we are a holding company with no significant assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries, we depend upon dividends from our Bank for a substantial part of our revenue. Accordingly, our ability to pay dividends, cover operating expenses, and acquire other institutions depends primarily upon the receipt of dividends or other capital distributions from the Bank. The ability of our Bank to pay dividends to us is subject to, among other things, its earnings, financial condition and need for funds, as well as federal and state governmental policies and regulations applicable to us and the Bank, which limit the amount that may be paid as dividends without prior approval.. Although we have historically paid dividends to our stockholders, we have no obligation to continue doing so and may change our dividend policy at any time without notice to our stockholders. Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such cash dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. The amount of any dividend declaration is subject to our evaluation of our strategic plans, growth initiatives, capital availability, projected liquidity needs and other factors.. An investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit.. Our Class A and Class B common stock is not a bank savings account or deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or any other public or private entity. As a result, holders of our common stock could lose some or all of their investment.. Holders of the Class B common stock have voting control of our company and are able to determine virtually all matters submitted to stockholders, including potential change in control transactions.. Members of the Scott family control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Due to their holdings of common stock, members of the Scott family are able to determine the outcome of virtually all matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our articles of incorporation (except when a class vote is required by law or pursuant to our articles of incorporation), any merger or consolidation requiring common stockholder approval and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Accordingly, such holders have the ability to prevent change in control transactions as long as they maintain voting control of the company.. In addition, because these holders have the ability to elect all of our directors they are able to control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, the payments of dividends on our common stock, and entering into extraordinary transactions, and their interests may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of all stockholders. The Scott family members have entered into a stockholder agreement giving family members a right of first refusal to purchase shares of Class B common stock that are intended to be sold or transferred, subject to certain exceptions, by other family members. This agreement may have the effect of continuing ownership of the Class B common stock and control within the Scott family. This concentrated control limits stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.. 20. Table of Contents. \"Anti-takeover\" provisions and the regulations to which we are subject may also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders.. We are a financial and bank holding company incorporated in the State of Montana. Anti-takeover provisions in Montana law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as regulatory approvals that would be required under federal law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock. These provisions could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and could reduce the amount that Class A and Class B stockholders might receive if we are sold.. Our articles of incorporation provide that our Board may issue up to 100,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, without stockholder approval and with such terms, conditions, rights, privileges and preferences as the Board may deem appropriate. In addition, our articles of incorporation provide for staggered terms for our Board and limitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders. In addition, certain provisions of Montana law may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of such Class A common stock.. Further, the acquisition of specified amounts of our common stock (in some cases, the acquisition or control of more than 5% of our voting stock) may require certain regulatory approvals, including the approval of the Federal Reserve and one or more of our state banking regulatory agencies. The filing of applications with these agencies and the accompanying review process can take several months. Additionally, as discussed above, the holders of the Class B common stock will have voting control of our company. This and the other factors described above may hinder or even prevent a change in control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.. We qualify as a \"controlled company\" under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules and may rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.. Due to the combined voting power of the members of the Scott family, we qualify as a \"controlled company\" under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules.  As a \"controlled company\" we are exempt from certain NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:. • a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;. • the compensation of officers be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors; and. • director nominees be selected, or recommended for the board of directors' selection, by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee comprised solely of independent directors with a written charter or board resolution addressing the nomination process.. As a result, our future compensation and governance and nominating committees may not consist entirely of independent directors. As long as we choose to rely on these exemptions from NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, stockholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements.. Future equity issuances could result in dilution, which could cause our common stock price to decline.. We may issue additional Class A common stock in the future pursuant to current or future employee equity compensation plans or in connection with future acquisitions or financings. Should we choose to raise capital by selling shares of Class A common stock for any reason, the issuance would have a dilutive effect on the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our Class A common stock.. The common stock is equity and is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness.. Shares of our Class A and Class B common stock are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, shares of our Class A and Class B common stock rank junior to all our indebtedness, including any subordinated term loans, subordinated debentures held by trusts that have issued trust preferred securities other non-equity claims on us with respect to assets available to satisfy claims on us. In the future, we may make additional offerings of debt or equity securities or, we may issue additional debt or equity securities as consideration for future mergers and acquisitions."
