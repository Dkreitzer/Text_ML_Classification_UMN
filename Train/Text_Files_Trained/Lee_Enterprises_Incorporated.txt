[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Risk exists that our past results may not be indicative of future results. In addition, a number of other factors (those identified elsewhere in this document) may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Potential investors should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual Report in evaluating us and our common stock. See also, \"Forward-Looking Statements\", included herein.. 11. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. Our operations rely on the local economies in which we serve, and we are also susceptible to general economic downturns, which have had and could continue to have a material and adverse impact on our operating results. It is difficult to estimate the level of economic growth or contraction as current and future conditions in the economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty. Adverse changes may occur to our business as a result of weak global economic conditions, declining oil prices, wavering consumer confidence, unemployment, declines in stock markets, contraction of credit availability, changes in interest rates, declines in real estate values, or other factors affecting economic conditions in general. These changes may negatively affect the sales of our products, increase exposure to losses from bad debts, increase the cost and decrease the availability of financing, or increase costs associated with publishing and distributing our publications.. OPERATING REVENUE. Our operating revenue may be materially adversely affected if we do not successfully respond to the shift in newspaper readership and advertising expenditures away from traditional print media. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from advertising. The demand for advertising is sensitive to the overall level of economic strength, both locally and nationally. Our revenues are sensitive to economic trends and uncertainties as well as discretionary spending by advertisers and subscribers. Changes in advertising and circulation revenue could have a material effect on our results of operations.. Operating revenue in most print categories has decreased since 2007 and may decrease further in the future. Such decreases may not be offset by growth in advertising in other categories, such as digital revenue which has been rising since 2010. Historically, newspaper publishing has been viewed as a cost-effective method of delivering various forms of advertising. There can be no guarantee that this historical perception will guide future decisions on the part of advertisers. Web sites and applications for mobile devices distributing news and other content continue to gain popularity. As a result, audience attention and advertising spending are shifting and may continue to shift from traditional print media to digital media including those owned by the Company. As media audiences increasingly move to consume news and information digitally, we expect that advertisers will allocate greater portions of their future budgets to digital media advertising, which can offer more measurable returns than traditional print media. If our efforts to adapt to evolving technological developments in the media industry are unsuccessful, or if we fail to correctly anticipate shifts in audience demand and digital media trends, we may be unable to provide the services, media and content that audiences and potential audiences in our markets prefer and we may be unable to provide the returns on ad spending that our advertisers seek. This increased competition and shift to the digital consumption of news and information has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Significant capital investment may be required to respond to this shift.The digital media industry has greater competitive challenges than print because barriers to entry can be low and geographic location is less relevant.. Technological developments also pose additional challenges that could adversely affect our revenue and competitive position. New delivery platforms may lead to pricing restrictions and the loss of a direct relationship with consumers. We may also be adversely affected if the use of technology developed to block the display of advertising on websites and other digital platforms proliferates.. The rates we charge for advertising are, in part, related to the size of the audience of our publications and digital products. There is significant competition for readers and viewers from other media. Our business may be adversely affected to the extent individuals decide to obtain news, entertainment, classified listings and local shopping information from digital or other media, to the exclusion of our outlets for such information.. Retail Advertising. Many advertisers, including major retail store chains, automobile dealers, banks and telecommunications companies, have experienced significant merger and acquisition activity over the last several years, and some have gone out of business or closed stores. Changes in the economy and consumer shopping habits, in particular, in the brick and mortar retail sector along with the increasing use of online consumer shopping, has driven a change in advertising spending and retailers approach to advertising and marketing their goods and services.. 12. Classified Advertising. Classified print and digital advertising for employment, automotive and real estate have been significantly reduced by changing trends in how our audiences access and use our products and the increase in digital/classified advertising competitors.. Subscription Revenue. Advertising and subscription revenue is affected by readership of our print publications and digital products. Although our combined print and digital audience is relatively stable, print subscription volumes have been declining for several years, reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry, including consumer migration toward digital media platforms for accessing news and information. The Company has increased its subscription rate and the possibility exists that future subscription price increases may be difficult to realize or maintain and as a result subscription sales may decline, and price decreases may be necessary to retain or grow subscription volume. We believe we are maintaining our share of audience in our local markets through digital audience growth and strong print newspaper readership.. As audience attention increasingly migrate to digital media, print circulation of our newspapers may be adversely affected, which may decrease subscription revenue and accelerate declines in print advertising. We face increasing competition from digital news sources which can impact subscription revenue and audience growth. This competition has increased as a result of the continued development of new digital media technologies. To maintain our subscription base, we may be required to incur additional costs that we may not be able to recover through subscription and advertising revenue. We may not be able to achieve a profitable balance between subscription levels and advertising revenue. In addition, if we are not successful in growing our digital businesses, including digital subscription revenue, to offset declines in revenue from our print products, our business, financial condition and prospects will be adversely affected.. Our ability to retain a subscriber base with all access pricing depends on market acceptance, consumer habits, cost, an adequate digital infrastructure, terms of delivery platforms and other factors. The metered paywall model and/or subscription price increases may result in fewer page views or unique visitors to our digital platforms if viewers are unwilling to pay to gain access to our digital content after reaching the maximum number of free articles in a month. Stagnation, or a decline in digital traffic levels, will adversely affect our advertiser base, advertising rates and result in a decline in digital revenue.. See \"Audiences\" in Item 1, included herein, for additional information on the risks associated with subscription revenue.. If we are not successful in growing our digital business, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. The future revenue performance of our digital business depends to a significant degree upon the growth development and management of our subscriber and advertising audiences. The growth of our digital business over the long term depends on various factors, including, among other things, the ability to:. • Continue to increase digital audiences;. • Attract advertisers to our digital platforms;. • Tailor our products to efficiently and effectively deliver content and advertising on mobile devices;. • Maintain or increase the advertising rates on our digital platforms;. •. • Exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of competitors and develop new content, products and services;. • Invest funds and resources in digital opportunities;. • Partner with, or use services from, providers that can assist us in effectively growing our digital business; and. 13. • Create digital content and platforms that attracts and engages audiences in our markets.. We expect that our digital business will continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenue. In 2017, total digital revenue (including revenue from advertising and marketing services and digital services, mainly TownNews.com) comprised 18.7% of total revenue, as compared to 16.4% in 2016. As our digital business becomes a greater portion of our overall business, we will face a number of increased risks from managing our digital operations, including, but not limited, to the following:. • Continuing training of our sales force to more effectively sell digital only advertising, combined digital and print advertising packages versus our historical print advertising business;. • Attracting and retaining employees with skill sets and the knowledge base needed to successfully operate our digital business; and. • Managing the transition to a digital business from a historically print-focused business, including reducing the physical printing and distribution infrastructure cost associated with the print business.. We rely on revenue from printing and distribution of third-party publications and digital services that may be subject to many of the same business and industry risks facing us. We generate a portion of our revenue from printing and distributing third-party publications, and our relationships with these third parties are generally pursuant to short-term contracts. Typically, these third parties are operating in the same industry and a similar geographical location as us. In addition, digital services revenue is derived primarily from third-party businesses in the same industry as us. As a result, revenue from these third parties is subject to the same macroeconomic and industry trends affecting our operations. If their businesses are adversely affected by these trends, our associated revenue would be adversely affected.. OPERATING EXPENSES. We may not be able to reduce future expenses to offset potential revenue declines. We reduced cash costs(1) of our operations (compensation, newsprint and ink, other operating expenses and workforce adjustments) significantly since 2011. Such expense reductions are not expected to impact our ability to deliver advertising, news or other content to our customers. As a result of the significant cost reductions to date, future cost reductions may not be as significant.  Compensation and newspaper distribution account for 63% of our cash costs excluding workforce adjustments.. Newsprint comprises approximately 6% of our cash costs excluding workforce adjustments. See \"Newsprint\" in Item 1, and \"Commodities\" in Item 7A, included herein, for additional information on the risks associated with changes in newsprint costs.. The technological developments and changes we need to make to our business successful, may require significant capital investments. We may be limited in our ability to invest funds and resources in digital products, services or opportunities, and we may incur costs of research and development in building and maintaining the necessary and continually evolving technology infrastructure. As a result, our digital business could suffer if we are unable to make these investments.. (1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures: in Item 7, included herein, for additional information.. We may incur additional non-cash impairment charges. We have significant amounts of goodwill and identified intangible assets. Since 2007 we have recorded impairment charges totaling almost $1.3 billion to reflect the reduced value of these assets. Should general economic, market or business conditions decline, and cause a negative impact on our stock price or projected future cash flows, we may need to record additional impairment charges in the future. Such charges would not impact our cash flows or debt covenant compliance. See \"Critical Accounting Policies\" in Item 7, included herein, for additional information on the risks associated with such assets.. 14. Sustained increases in costs of employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability. In recent years, we experienced significant increases in the cost of employee medical benefits because of economic factors beyond our control, including increases in health care costs. At least some of these factors may continue to put upward pressure on the cost of providing medical benefits. Although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses.. Sustained increases in funding requirements of our pension and postretirement obligations may reduce the cash available for our business. Pension liabilities, net of plan assets, totaled $43.5 million at September 24, 2017.  The Company expects to make pension contributions of $4.9 million in 2018. At September 24, 2017 the assets of one of our postretirement medical plans exceeded plan liabilities by $11.0 million.. Our pension and postretirement plans invest in a variety of equity and debt securities. Future volatility and disruption in the securities markets could cause declines in the asset values of our pension and postretirement plans. In addition, a decrease in the discount rates or changes to mortality estimates and other assumptions used to determine the liability could increase the benefit obligation of the plans. Unfavorable changes to the plan assets and/or the benefit obligations could increase the level of required contributions above what is currently estimated, which could reduce the cash available for our business and debt service. Legislation passed in 2012, 2014 and 2015 temporarily reduced funding requirements for our pension plans, but those payments will eventually need to be restored unless discount rates and/or plan assets increase.. We expect to be subject to withdrawal liability in connection with one multiemployer pension plan and may be subject to additional withdrawal liabilities in connection with other multiemployer pension plans, which may reduce the cash available for our business. Pursuant to our collective bargaining obligations, we contribute to three multiemployer pension plans on behalf of certain of our employees. Based on the most recent communications from the plans' administrators, two of these plans are currently in \"critical\" status, as that term is used in relation to such plans under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. For plans that are in critical status, benefit reductions may apply and/or we could be required to make additional contributions.. One of our enterprise's bargaining units withdrew from representation, and as a result we are subject to a claim from the multiemployer pension plan for a withdrawal liability. The amount of such liability will be dependent on actions taken, or not taken, by the pension plan, as well as the future investment performance and funding status of the pension plan. The withdrawal liability is expected to be funded over a 20 year period.. If, we were to withdraw from one of the remaining plans or trigger a partial withdrawal due to declines in contribution base units, and the plan had unfunded vested benefits at the time of our withdrawal or partial withdrawal, we could incur a significant plan withdrawal liability, which could reduce the cash available for our business.. CAPITAL. We may have insufficient earnings or liquidity to meet our future debt obligations. We have $548.4 million of debt outstanding as of September 24, 2017, as discussed more fully below (and certain capitalized terms used below defined) in Item 7,\"Liquidity\" and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein. Since February 2009, we have satisfied substantially all principal and interest payments due under our debt facilities with our cash flows and asset sales.. As of September 24, 2017, our debt consists of the following:. • $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 9.5% Senior Secured Notes (the \"Notes\") due March 2022, pursuant to an Indenture dated as of March 31, 2014 (the \"Indenture\"), of which $385,000,000 is currently outstanding as of September 24, 2017;. 15. • $250,000,000 first lien term loan (the \"1st Lien Term Loan\") due March 2019 and $40,000,000 revolving facility (the \"Revolving Facility\") under a First Lien Credit Agreement dated as of March 31, 2014 (together, the \"1st Lien Credit Facility\"), of which $45,145,000 is outstanding at September 24, 2017; and. • $150,000,000 12.0% second lien term loan under a Second Lien Loan Agreement dated as of March 31, 2014 (the \"2nd Lien Term Loan\") due December 2022, of which $118,240,000 is outstanding at September 24, 2017.. The ability to make payments on our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash flows from operations in the future. Cash generated from future asset sales could serve as an additional source of debt repayment. Our ability, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.. At September 24, 2017, after consideration of letters of credit, we have approximately $33,818,000 available for future use under our Revolving Facility.  Including cash, our liquidity at September 24, 2017 totals $44,439,000. This liquidity amount excludes any future cash flows. Our adjusted EBITDAhas been strong and has exceeded $144 million in each year from 2011 through 2017, but there can be no assurance that such results will continue. We expect all interest and principal payments due in the next twelve months will be satisfied by our cash flows and certain asset sales, which will allow us to maintain an adequate level of liquidity.. At September 24, 2017, the principal amount of our outstanding debt totals $548,385,000. At September 24, 2017 and           September 25, 2016 our debt, net of cash, is 3.7 times and 3.9 times our adjusted EBITDA, respectively.. Final maturities of our debt are March 2019 through December 2022.  As a result, we believe refinancing risk has been substantially reduced for the next several years.. There are numerous potential consequences under the Notes, 1st Lien Credit Facility, 2nd Lien Term Loan, if an event of default, as defined, occurs and is not remedied. Many of those consequences are beyond our control. The occurrence of one or more events of default would give rise to the right of the applicable lenders to exercise their remedies under the Notes, 1st Lien Credit Facility, 2nd Lien Term Loan, respectively, including, without limitation, the right to accelerate the repayment of all outstanding debt and take actions authorized in such circumstances under applicable collateral security documents.. Our ability to operate as a going concern is dependent on our ability to remain in compliance with debt covenants and to refinance or amend our debt agreements as they become due, if necessary.  The Notes, 1st Lien Credit Facility and 2nd Lien Term Loan have only limited affirmative covenants with which we are required to maintain compliance. We are in compliance with our debt covenants at September 24, 2017.. The Notes, 1st Lien Credit Facility and 2nd Lien Term Loan each contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to grow our business or return capital to our stockholders. The Notes, 1st Lien Credit Facility and 2nd Lien Term Loan each contain various restrictions, covenants and representations and warranties. If we fail to comply with any of these covenants or breach these representations or warranties in any material respect, such noncompliance would constitute a default, and the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the agreements related thereto to be immediately due and payable and enforce their respective interests against collateral pledged under such agreements.. The covenants and restrictions generally limit or restrict our ability to, among other things:. •incur or guarantee additional debt;. •make certain investments, loans or acquisitions;. •transfer or sell assets; and. •make certain restricted payments, including repurchases of outstanding common stock and dividends.. The restrictions described above may interfere with our ability to obtain new or additional financing or engage in other business activities, which may significantly limit or harm our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.. 16. A decrease in our stock price may limit the ability to trade our stock or for the Company to raise equity capital. Under the NYSE listing standards, if our common stock fails to maintain an adequate per share price and our total market capitalization falls below $50.0 million, our common stock could be removed from the NYSE and traded in the over the counter market. In July 2011, the NYSE notified us that our common stock did not meet the NYSE continued listing standards due to the failure to maintain an adequate share price. Under the NYSE rules, our common stock was allowed to continue to be listed during a cure period. In February 2012, after completing our debt refinancing, the NYSE notified us that we were again in compliance with the minimum closing price standard. In January 2013, the NYSE notified us that we had returned to full compliance with all continued listing standards. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to meet these listing standards, and the removal of our common stock from the NYSE could adversely affect our ability to raise equity capital.. OTHER. Cybersecurity risks could harm our ability to operate effectively and our reputation. In the 13-weeks ended September 24, 2017, 19.2% of our revenue was obtained from digital sources, including advertising and one of our businesses, TownNews.com, that provides digital infrastructure and digital publishing services for us and other companies.. We use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations. Such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including the misappropriation of personally identifiable information that we store and manage and disabling or taking over of our websites. We have preventive systems and processes in place to protect against the risk of cyber incidents. However, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access and to disable systems and websites change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. There can be no assurance that we, or the security systems we implement, will protect against all of these rapidly changing risks. Prolonged system outages or a cyber incident that goes undetected could reduce our print and/or digital revenue, increase our operating costs, disrupt our operations, harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers and employees as well as subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect our customers and employees personal data. We maintain insurance coverage against certain of such risks, but cannot guarantee that such coverage will be applicable or sufficient with respect to any given incident.. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, which may adversely affect our business. Our business depends on our intellectual property, including our valuable brands and content. We believe our proprietary trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to our continued success and our competitive position.. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our content or infringe upon, dilute, reproduce, misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property. There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be successful in any given case."
