[1] "ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS. AxoGen's business involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond its control.  The risk and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces.  Set forth below is a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that management believes to be material to AxoGen.. Risks Related To The Company. AxoGen has not experienced positive cash flow from its operations, and the ability to achieve positive cash flow from operations will depend on increasing revenue from distribution of its products, which may not be achievable.. AxoGen has historically operated with negative cash flow from its operations. As of December 31, 2017, AxoGen had an accumulated deficit of approximately $128 million. If AxoGen revenue does not increase as anticipated, then it will continue to experience negative cash flows and adverse operating conditions. AxoGen's continuing capital needs and other factors could cause the Company to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or from other sources. The sale of additional equity may result in dilution to AxoGen's shareholders. There is no assurance that AxoGen will be able to secure funding on terms acceptable to it, or at all.. AxoGen's revenue growth depends on its ability to expand its sales force, increase distribution and sales to existing customers and develop new customers, and there can be no assurance that these efforts will result in significant increase in sales.. AxoGen is in the process of investing in its distribution and sales channels composed of a combination of its direct sales force and independent distributors to allow it to increase distribution and sales to existing customers and reach new customers. There can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful in expanding AxoGen's revenue. AxoGen. 39. Table of Contents. currently distributes tissue and sells products directly through its employees and indirectly through distributor relationships. AxoGen is engaged in an initiative to build and further expand sales and marketing capabilities. The incurrence of these expenses impacts AxoGen's operating results, and there can be no assurance of their effectiveness. If AxoGen is unable to develop its sales force, increase sales to existing customers and attract new customers, it may not be able to grow revenue or maintain its current level of revenue generation.. AxoGen's revenue depends primarily on four products.. Substantially all of AxoGen's revenue is currently derived from only four products, the Avance® Nerve Graft, Avive® Soft Tissue Membrane, AxoGuard® Nerve Protector and AxoGuard® Nerve Connector, for the treatment of peripheral nerve damage. Of these four products, the Avance® Nerve Graft represents approximately half of the Company's total revenues.   Any disruption in AxoGen's ability to generate revenue from the distribution of tissue and sale of products will have a material adverse impact on AxoGen's business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.. The AxoGuard® products are only available through an exclusive distribution agreement with Cook Biotech. The agreement was amended February 26, 2018 to run through June 30, 2027.  However, there are conditions for continuation of the agreement, including payment terms and minimum purchase requirements, that if breached could result in an earlier termination of the agreement; except that through mutual agreement the parties have not established such minimums and to date have not enforced such minimum purchase provision. Additionally, in the event that AxoGen and Cook Biotech were to fail to reach an agreement as to minimum purchase quantities, Cook Biotech could terminate the agreement if it was deemed that AxoGen had failed to generate commercially reasonable sales of AxoGuard® as measured by sales similar to a competitive product at the same stage in its commercial launch as verified by a mutually acceptable third party. Although there are products that AxoGen believes it could develop or obtain that would replace the AxoGuard® products obtained through the agreement with Cook Biotech, the loss of the ability to sell the AxoGuard® products could have a material adverse effect on AxoGen's business until other replacement products are available.. AxoGen's success will be dependent on continued acceptance of its products by the medical community.. Continued market acceptance of AxoGen's products will depend on its ability to demonstrate that its products are an attractive alternative to existing nerve reconstruction treatment options and provide appropriate solutions for nerve repair. Its ability to do so will depend on surgeons' evaluations of clinical safety, efficacy, ease of use, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of AxoGen's nerve repair products. For example, although AxoGen's Avance® Nerve Graft follows stringent safety standards, including sterilization by gamma irradiation, AxoGen believes that a small portion of the medical community has lingering concerns over the risk of disease transmission through the use of allografts in general. Furthermore, AxoGen believes that even if its products receive general acceptance within the medical community, acceptance and clinical recommendations by influential surgeons will be important to the commercial success of AxoGen's products.. Negative publicity concerning methods of donating human tissue and screening of donated tissue, in the industry in which AxoGen operates, may reduce demand for its products and negatively impact the supply of available donor tissue.. AxoGen is highly dependent on its ability to recover human tissue from tissue donors for its Avance® Nerve Graft product and Avive® Soft Tissue Membrane. The availability of acceptable donors is relatively limited, and this availability is impacted by regulatory changes, general public opinion of the donation process and AxoGen's reputation for its handling of the donation process. Media reports or other negative publicity concerning both improper methods of tissue recovery from donors and disease transmission from donated tissue, including bones and tendons, may limit widespread acceptance of AxoGen's Avance® Nerve Graft and Avive® Soft Tissue Membrane. Unfavorable reports of improper or illegal tissue recovery practices, both in the U.S. and internationally, as well as incidents of improperly processed tissue leading to transmission of disease, may broadly affect the rate of future tissue donation and market acceptance of allograft technologies and donated tissue use. Potential patients may not be able to distinguish AxoGen products, technologies, and tissue recovery and processing procedures from others engaged in tissue recovery. In. 40. Table of Contents. addition, unfavorable reports could make families of potential donors or donors themselves from whom AxoGen is required to obtain consent before processing tissue reluctant to agree to donate tissue to for-profit tissue processors. Any disruption in the supply could have negative consequences for AxoGen's revenue, operating results and continued operations.. AxoGen is highly dependent on the continued availability of its facilities and could be harmed if the facilities are unavailable for any prolonged period of time.. Any failure in the physical infrastructure of AxoGen's facilities, including the facility it licenses from CTS, could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce its revenues and harm its business reputation and financial results. Any natural or man-made event that impacts AxoGen's ability to utilize its facilities could have a significant impact on its operating results, reputation and ability to continue operations. This includes termination of the CTS facility service agreement which can occur upon 18 months' prior notice from either party. Although AxoGen believes it can find and make operational a new facility in less than six months, the regulatory process for approval of facilities is time-consuming and unpredictable. AxoGen's ability to rebuild or find acceptable service facilities takes a considerable amount of time and expense and could cause a significant disruption in service to its customers.  Although AxoGen has business interruption insurance which would, in instances other than service agreement termination, cover certain costs, it may not cover all costs nor help to regain AxoGen's standing in the market.. AxoGen must maintain high quality processing of its products.. AxoGen's Avance® Nerve Graft is processed through its Avance® Process which requires careful calibration and precise, high-quality processing and manufacturing. Its Avive® Soft Tissue Membrane is also human tissue that requires skill in its processing.  Achieving precision and quality control requires skill and diligence by its personnel. If it fails to achieve and maintain these high levels of quality control and processing standards, including avoidance of processing errors, defects or product failures, AxoGen could experience recalls or withdrawals of its product, delays in delivery, cost overruns or other problems that would adversely affect its business. AxoGen cannot completely eliminate the risk of errors, defects or failures. In addition, AxoGen may experience difficulties in scaling-up processing of its Avance® and Avive® products, including problems related to yields, quality control and assurance, tissue availability, adequacy of control policies and procedures, and lack of skilled personnel. If AxoGen is unable to process and produce its human tissue products on a timely basis, at acceptable quality and costs, and in sufficient quantities, or if it experiences unanticipated technological problems or delays in production, its business would be adversely affected.. Delays, interruptions or the cessation of production by AxoGen's third party suppliers of important materials or delays in qualifying new materials, may prevent or delay AxoGen's ability to manufacture or process the final products.. Most of the raw materials used in the process for Avance® Nerve Graft and Avive® Soft Tissue Membrane are available from more than one supplier. However, one of the chemicals AxoGen uses in the processing of Avance® Nerve Graft is no longer manufactured by the original single source provider. AxoGen has inventory of such chemical which it believes provides more than one year of production. AxoGen is currently evaluating multiple avenues including new suppliers of the chemical and acceptable substitutes for the chemical. In addition, some of the test results, packaging and reagents/chemicals AxoGen uses in its manufacturing process are also obtained from single suppliers. AxoGen does not have written contracts with any of its single source suppliers, and at any time they could stop supplying AxoGen's orders. FDA approval of a new supplier may be required if these materials become unavailable from AxoGen's current suppliers. Although there may be other suppliers that have equivalent materials that would be available to AxoGen, FDA approval of any alternate suppliers, if required, could take several months or years to obtain, if able to be obtained at all. Any delay, interruption or cessation of production by AxoGen's third party suppliers of important materials, or any delay in qualifying new materials, if necessary, would prevent or delay AxoGen's ability to manufacture products. In addition, an uncorrected impurity, a supplier's variation in a raw material or testing, either unknown to AxoGen or incompatible with its manufacturing process, or any other problem with AxoGen's materials, testing or components, would prevent or delay its ability to process tissue. These delays may limit AxoGen's ability to meet demand for its products and delay its clinical trial, which would have a material adverse impact on its business, results of operations and financial condition.. 41. Table of Contents. The failure of third parties to perform many necessary services for the commercialization of Avance® Nerve Graft and Avive® Soft Tissue Membrane, including services related to recovery, distribution and transportation, would impair AxoGen's ability to meet commercial demand.. AxoGen relies upon third parties for certain recovery, distribution and transportation services. In accordance with product specifications, third parties ship Avance® Nerve Graft in specially validated shipping containers at frozen temperatures. If any of the third parties that AxoGen relies upon in its recovery, distribution or transportation process fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or otherwise do not carry out their contractual duties to AxoGen, or encounter physical damage or natural disaster at their facilities, AxoGen's ability to deliver product to meet commercial demand may be significantly impaired.. AxoGen is dependent on its relationships with distributors to generate revenue.. AxoGen derives material revenues through its relationships with distributors. If such distributor relationships were terminated for any reason, it could materially and adversely affect AxoGen's ability to generate revenues and profits. AxoGen intends to obtain the assistance of additional distributors to continue its revenue growth. It may not be able to find additional distributors who will agree to market and distribute its products on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If AxoGen is unable to establish new distribution relationships or renew current distribution agreements on commercially acceptable terms, its operating results could suffer.. Loss of key members of management, who it needs to succeed, could adversely affect its business.. AxoGen's future success depends on the continued efforts of the members of its senior management team. Competition for experienced management personnel in the healthcare industry is intense. If one or more of AxoGen's senior executives or other key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, or if AxoGen is unable to attract and retain high quality senior executives or key personnel in the future, its business may be adversely affected.. AxoGen's operating results will be harmed if it is unable to effectively manage and sustain its future growth or scale its operations.. There can be no assurance that AxoGen will be able to manage its future growth efficiently or profitably. Its business is unproven on a large scale and actual revenue and operating margins, or revenue and margin growth, may be less than expected. If AxoGen is unable to scale its production capabilities efficiently or maintain pricing without significant discounting, it may fail to achieve expected operating margins, which would have a material and adverse effect on its operating results. Growth may also stress AxoGen's ability to adequately manage its operations, quality of products, safety and regulatory compliance. If growth significantly decreases it will negatively impact AxoGen's cash reserves, and it may be required to obtain additional financing, which may increase indebtedness or result in dilution to shareholders. Further, there can be no assurance that AxoGen would be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms if all at.. There may be significant fluctuations in AxoGen's operating results.. Significant quarterly fluctuations in AxoGen's results of operations may be caused by, among other factors, its volume of revenues, seasonal changes in nerve repair activity, timing of sales force expansion and general economic conditions. There can be no assurance that the level of revenues and profits, if any, achieved by AxoGen in any particular fiscal period, will not be significantly lower than in other comparable fiscal periods. AxoGen's expense levels are based, in part, on its expectations as to future revenues. As a result, if future revenues are below expectations, net income or loss may be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenues, as any corresponding reduction in expenses may not be proportionate to the reduction in revenues.. 42. Table of Contents. AxoGen's revenues depend upon prompt and adequate reimbursement from public and private insurers and national health systems.. Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the U.S. to fundamental change. The ability of hospitals to pay fees for AxoGen's products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such materials and related treatments will continue to be available from governmental health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other organizations. Major third-party payers of hospital services and hospital outpatient services, including Medicare, Medicaid and private healthcare insurers, annually revise their payment methodologies which can result in stricter standards for reimbursement of hospital and/or surgeon charges for certain medical procedures or the elimination of reimbursement. Further, Medicare, Medicaid and private healthcare insurer cutbacks could create downward price pressure on AxoGen's products.. AxoGen may be subject to future product liability litigation which could be expensive and its insurance coverage may not be adequate.. Although AxoGen is not currently subject to any product liability proceedings and it has no reserves for product liability disbursements, it may incur material liabilities relating to product liability claims in the future, including product liability claims arising out of the usage of AxoGen products. Although AxoGen currently carries product liability insurance in an amount consistent with industry averages, its insurance coverage and any reserves it may maintain in the future for product related liabilities may not be adequate and AxoGen's business could suffer material adverse consequences.. Technological change could reduce demand for AxoGen's products.. The medical technology industry is intensely competitive. AxoGen competes with both U.S. and international companies that engage in the development and production of medical technologies and processes including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbiotechnology, orthopedic, pharmaceutical, biomaterial, chemical and other companies;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacademic and scientific institutions; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpublic and private research organizations.. AxoGen products compete with autograft, hollow-tube conduits, commercially available wraps and amnion products, as well as with alternative medical procedures. For the foreseeable future, AxoGen believes a significant number of surgeons will continue to choose to perform autograft procedures when feasible, despite the necessity of performing a second operation and its drawbacks. In addition, many members of the medical community will continue to prefer the use of hollow-tube conduits due in part to their familiarity with these products and the procedures required for their use. Amnion products are widely available and AxoGen may not be able to distinguish the Avive® Soft Tissue Membrane from such other products so as to produce significant revenue from its distribution.  Also, steady improvements have been made in synthetic human tissue substitutes, which could compete with AxoGen's products in the future. Unlike allografts, synthetic tissue technologies are not dependent on the availability of human or animal tissue. Although AxoGen's growth strategy contemplates the introduction of new technologies, the development of these technologies is a complex and uncertain process, requiring a high level of innovation, as well as the ability to accurately predict future technology and market trends. AxoGen may not be able to respond effectively to technological changes and emerging industry standards, or to successfully identify, develop or support new technologies or enhancements to existing products in a timely and cost-effective manner, if at all. Finally, there can be no assurance that in the future AxoGen's competitors will not develop products that have superior performance or are less expensive relative to AxoGen's products rendering AxoGen's products obsolete or noncompetitive.  Due to its limited resources, its smaller size and its relatively early stage, AxoGen may face competitive challenges and barriers that are difficult to overcome and could negatively impact its growth.. AxoGen may be unsuccessful in commercializing its products outside the U.S.. To date, AxoGen has focused its commercialization efforts in the U.S., except for minor revenues in certain countries outside the U.S. AxoGen intends to expand distribution and sales in these and other countries outside the U.S.. 43. Table of Contents. and will need to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, including obtaining the requisite approvals to do so. Avive® Soft Tissue Membrane is only available in the U.S. and has not, as of this time period, received any regulatory registration allowing for distribution outside the U.S.  Additionally, AxoGen will need to either enter into distribution agreements with third parties or develop a direct sales force in these foreign markets. If it does not obtain adequate levels of reimbursement from third party payers outside of the U.S., it may be unable to develop and grow its revenue internationally. Outside of the U.S., reimbursement systems vary significantly by country. Many foreign markets have government-managed healthcare systems that govern reimbursement for medical devices, implants and procedures. Additionally, some foreign reimbursement systems provide for limited payments in a given period and therefore result in extended payment periods. If AxoGen is unable to successfully commercialize its products internationally, its long-term growth prospects may be limited.. If AxoGen does not manage tissue and tissue donation in an effective and efficient manner, it could adversely affect its business.. Many factors affect the supply, quantity and timing of donor medical releases, such as effectiveness of donor screening, the effective recovery of tissue, the timely receipt, recording, review and approval of required medical and testing documentation, and employee loss and turnover in AxoGen's and its contractor's recovery department. AxoGen can provide no assurance that tissue recovery or donor medical releases will occur at levels that will maximize processing efficiency and minimize AxoGen's costs.. If AxoGen does not manage product inventory in an effective and efficient manner, it could adversely affect profitability.. Many factors affect the efficient use and planning of product inventory, such as effectiveness of predicting demand, effectiveness of preparing manufacturing to meet demand, efficiently meeting product mix and product demand requirements and product expiration. AxoGen may be unable to manage its inventory efficiently, keep inventory within expected budget goals, keep its work-in-process inventory on hand or manage it efficiently, control expired product or keep sufficient product on hand to meet demand. Finally, AxoGen can provide no assurance that it can keep inventory costs within its target levels.   Failure to do so may harm long term growth prospects.. AxoGen's payment obligations under the MidCap Financial Trust Term Loan Agreement and Revolving Loan Agreement may adversely affect our financial position and our ability to obtain additional funds, and may increase our vulnerability to economic or business downturns.. As described in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  -  Liquidity and Capital Resources,\" on October 25, 2016 (the \"Closing Date\"), AxoGen and AC, each as borrowers, entered into the term loan agreement (the \"MC Term Loan Agreement\") with the lenders party thereto and MidCap Financial Trust (\"MidCap\"), as administrative agent and lender.  Under the MC Term Loan Agreement, MidCap provided AxoGen a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $21 million (the \"Term Loan\").  On the Closing Date AxoGen and AC, each as borrows, also entered into a Credit and Security Agreement (Revolving Loan) (the ''Revolving Loan Agreement\") with the lenders party thereto and MidCap, as administrative agent and a lender.  Under the Revolving Loan Agreement, MidCap has agreed to lend AxoGen up to $10 million under a revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Loan\") which amount may be drawn down by AxoGen based upon an available borrowing base.  The Revolving Loan may be increased to up to $15 million at AxoGen's request and with the approval of MidCap. As of December 31, 2017,  AxoGen's borrowing base under the Revolving Loan provided availability of approximately $7.7 million and had an outstanding balance of $4 million. The MC Term Loan Agreement, Revolving Loan Agreement and the indebtedness pursuant thereto are secured by substantially all of AxoGen's tangible and intangible assets.. Outstanding debt could have important negative consequences to the holders of AxoGen's securities, including the following:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta portion of our cash flow from operations will be needed to pay debt service and will not be available to fund future operations;. 44. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAxoGen is required to maintain certain covenants, the breach of which would result in default under the MC Term Loan Agreement and Revolving Loan Agreement;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAxoGen has increased vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAxoGen may be vulnerable to higher interest rates because interest expense on the Term Loan in limited circumstances could increase.. Payment requirements under the MC Term Loan Agreement and the Revolving Loan Agreement increase AxoGen's cash burden. AxoGen's future operating performance is subject to market conditions and business factors that are beyond its control. If AxoGen's cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to allow AxoGen to make required payments, AxoGen may have to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance its debt.  If AxoGen raises funds by selling additional equity, such sale would result in dilution to its shareholders. There is no assurance that if AxoGen is required to secure funding it can do so on terms acceptable to it, or at all.  Failure to pay interest or the principal amount when due would result in a default under the MC Term Loan Agreement and Revolving Loan Agreement and result in foreclosure on AxoGen's assets which would have a material adverse effect.. The MC Term Loan Agreement and Revolving Loan Agreement each contain certain covenants and failure to comply with the terms of such indebtedness could result in a default that could have material adverse consequences for us.. The MC Term Loan Agreement and the Revolving Loan Agreement each contain covenants that place restrictions on AxoGen's operations, including, without limitation, covenants related to debt restrictions, investment restrictions, dividend restrictions, restrictions on transactions with affiliates and certain revenue covenants. AxoGen's ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by general economic and industry conditions, as well as market fluctuations and other events beyond AxoGen's control. AxoGen does not know if it will be able to satisfy all such covenants in the future. AxoGen's breach of the covenants could result in a default under such agreements. In the event of a default under such agreements, the lender could require AxoGen to repay some of its outstanding debt prior to maturity, and/or to declare all amounts borrowed by it, together with accrued interest, to be due and payable. In the event that this occurs, AxoGen may be unable to repay all such accelerated indebtedness.  Any indebtedness that it incurs under the MC Term Loan Agreement and Revolving Loan Agreement is secured by substantially all of its tangible and intangible assets. If AxoGen defaults under the indebtedness secured by its assets, those assets would be available to the secured creditors to satisfy AxoGen's obligations to the secured creditors.  As of December 31, 2017, AxoGen was in compliance with the loan covenants.. AxoGen incurs costs as a result of operating as a public company, and its management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.. As a public company, AxoGen incurs legal, accounting and other expenses to comply with relevant securities laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the requirement of establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. AxoGen's management devotes substantial time and financial resources to these compliance initiatives. Failure to comply with public company requirements could have a material adverse effect on AxoGen's business.. Our business and stock price may  be  adversely affected if our internal controls are not effective.. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that public companies conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, each year we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting and our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning it.. 45. Table of Contents. In our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported material weaknesses in our internal control as of December 31, 2016 relating to the design and operation of key controls around the calculations of significant judgment and estimates and quarterly cycle count procedures related to consigned inventories. These control deficiencies did not result in any changes of prior period financial statements or previously released financial results.    We believe we took appropriate actions to remediate the control deficiencies we identified in these instances.. Although we have taken actions to correct the control deficiencies we identified and to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting, we cannot assure you that we will not discover other material weaknesses in the future or that no material weakness will result from any difficulties, errors, delays or disruptions while we implement and transition to new internal systems. The existence of one or more material weaknesses could result in errors in our financial statements, and substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify these or other internal control deficiencies. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly, we may be unable to obtain additional financing to operate and expand our business and our business and financial condition could be harmed.. Our business and financial performance could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by disasters, by terrorist activities or by international hostilities.. Neither the occurrence nor the potential impact of disasters (such as hurricanes and other natural disasters), terrorist activities and international hostilities can be predicted. However, these occurrences could impact us directly as a result of damage to our facilities or by preventing us from conducting our business in the ordinary course, or indirectly as a result of their impact on our customers, suppliers or other counterparties. We could also suffer adverse consequences to the extent that disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities affect the financial markets or the economy in general or in any particular region.. Our ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency planning, and our ability, if any, to anticipate the nature of any such event that occurs. The adverse impact of disasters or terrorist activities or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that we deal with, particularly those that we depend upon but have no control over.. Risks Related to the Regulatory Environment in which AxoGen Operates. AxoGen's business is subject to continuing regulatory compliance by the FDA and other authorities which is costly and could result in negative effects on its business.. AxoGen is subject to extensive regulation by foreign and domestic government entities and healthcare professionals, such as physicians, hospitals and those to whom and through whom we may market our products.  We are subject to scrutiny under various federal, state and territorial laws in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we conduct business. These include, for example, anti-kickback laws, physician self-referral laws, false claims laws, criminal health care fraud laws, and anti-bribery laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the United States, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws are administered by, among others, the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, state attorneys general, and their respective counterparts in the applicable foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years. There can also be changes to the regulations by foreign and domestic government entities that require AxoGen to update or upgrade business processes or to perform additional validation activities for product or processes.  Compliance with such changes can be costly to implement or result in non-compliance and restricting the ability to distribute tissue or sell products that would have a material adverse effect.. Our products are also subject to regulation by the FDA in the U.S. The FDA regulates the development, clinical testing, marketing, distribution, manufacturing, labeling, and promotion of biological products, such as that of AxoGen's. 46. Table of Contents. Avance® Nerve Graft product. The Avive® Soft Tissue Membrane is processed and distributed in accordance with FDA requirements for Human Cellular and Tissue-based Products (HCT/P) under 21 CFR Part 1271 regulations, U.S. State regulations. The FDA also regulates medical devices, for example the AxoGuard® products. The FDA requires the approval of a biological product, like the Avance® Nerve Graft product, through a BLA prior to marketing. Although the Avance® Nerve Graft product has not yet been approved by FDA through a BLA, FDA is permitting the product to be distributed, subject to FDA enforcement discretion, provided that  AxoGen: (1)  transitions to compliance with section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act, the cGMP regulations in 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 and the applicable regulations and standards in 21 CFR Parts 600-610 prior to initiation of a phase 3 clinical trial designed to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of the Avance®    Nerve Graft; (2) conducts a phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety, purity and potency of the Avance® Nerve Graft under an SPA; (3) continues to comply with the requirements of 21 CFR Part 1271; and (4) exercises due diligence in executing the transition plan.   See \"Business  -  Government Regulations  -  U.S. Government Regulation Review.\". The FDA also regulates medical devices and requires certain medical devices, such as the AxoGuard® products, be cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification process prior to marketing. The FDA's premarket review process for new and modified existing devices that precedes product marketing can be time consuming and expensive. Some of the future products and enhancements to such products that AxoGen expects to develop and market may require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA.. There can be no assurance, however, that clearance or approval will be granted with respect to any of AxoGen's device products or enhancements of marketed products or that AxoGen's Avance® Nerve Graft will achieve an effective IND or ultimately an approved BLA.  FDA review of AxoGen's devices or biological products may encounter significant delays during FDA's premarket review process that would adversely affect AxoGen's ability to market its products or enhancements. In addition, there can be no assurance that AxoGen products, including the Avance® Nerve Graft, or enhancements will not be subject to a lengthy and expensive approval process with the FDA.. It is possible that if regulatory clearances or approvals to market a product are obtained from the FDA, the clearances or approvals may contain limitations on the indicated uses of such product and other uses may be prohibited. Product approvals by the FDA can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval. Furthermore, the FDA could limit or prevent the distribution of AxoGen products and the FDA has the power to require the recall of such products. FDA regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation, and there can be no assurance that future interpretations made by the FDA or other regulatory bodies will not adversely affect AxoGen's operations. AxoGen, and its facilities, may be inspected by the FDA from time to time to determine whether it is in compliance with various regulations relating to specifications, development, documentation, validation, testing, quality control and product labeling. A determination that AxoGen is in violation of such regulations could lead to imposition of civil penalties, including fines, product recalls or product seizures and, in certain cases, criminal sanctions.. The use, misuse or off-label use of AxoGen's products may harm its reputation or the image of its products in the marketplace, or result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to AxoGen's business or result in FDA sanctions if the company is deemed to have engaged in off-label promotion. AxoGen is seeking a biologics license through the BLA process for specific uses of Avance® Nerve Graft under specific circumstances. Its promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA requirements and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition against off-label promotion. AxoGen's promotion of the AxoGuard® products, which are regulated as medical devices, also must comply with FDA's requirements and must only use labeling that is consistent with the specific indication(s) for use included in the FDA substantial equivalence order that results in marketing the devices. The Avive® Soft Tissue Membrane is processed and distributed in accordance with FDA requirements for (HCT/P) under 21 CFR Part 1271 regulations and is to be dispensed only by or on the order of a licensed physician and is contraindicated for use in any patient in whom soft tissue implants are contraindicated.    The FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician's use of a medical product within the practice of medicine, and AxoGen cannot prevent a physician from using its products for an off-label use. However, the FD&C Act and the FDA's regulations restrict the kind of promotional communications that may be made about AxoGen's products and if the FDA determines that AxoGen's promotional or training materials constitute the unlawful promotion of an off-label use, it could request that AxoGen modify its training or promotional materials and/or subject the Company to regulatory or enforcement actions, including. 47. Table of Contents. the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, civil money penalties, seizure, injunction or criminal fines and penalties. Other federal, state or foreign governmental authorities might also take action if they consider AxoGen promotion or training materials to constitute promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement, or exclusion from participation in federal health programs. In that event, AxoGen's reputation could be damaged and the use of its products in the marketplace could be impaired.. In addition, there may be increased risk of injury if physicians or others attempt to use AxoGen products off-label. Furthermore, the use of AxoGen's product for indications other than those for which its products have been approved, cleared or licensed by the FDA may not effectively treat the conditions not referenced in product indications, which could harm AxoGen's reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients. Physicians may also misuse AxoGen's product or use improper techniques if they are not adequately trained in the particular use, potentially leading to injury and an increased risk of product liability. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert management's attention from its primary business and result in substantial damage awards against AxoGen. Any of these events could harm AxoGen's business, results of operations and financial condition.. AxoGen's Avance® Nerve Graft product is currently allowed to be distributed pursuant to a transition plan with the FDA and a change in position by the FDA regarding its use of enforcement discretion to permit the sale of Avance® Nerve Graft would have a material adverse effect on AxoGen.. The FDA considers AxoGen's Avance® Nerve Graft product to be a biological product, subject to BLA approval requirements. Although the Avance® Nerve Graft product has not yet been approved by FDA through a BLA, AxoGen's Avance® Nerve Graft product is currently distributed under the controls applicable to a HCT/P pursuant to section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR Part 1271 of FDA's regulations, subject to FDA's enforcement discretion and AxoGen's compliance with a transition plan established by the FDA.  See \"Business  -  Government Regulations  -  U.S. Government Regulation Review.\"    AxoGen has continued to communicate with the FDA's CBER since the acceptance of the transition plan on clinical trial design, preclinical studies,  Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (\"CMC\") for the Avance® Nerve Graft, and other issues related to the effective IND  Subject to the FDA's enforcement discretion, AxoGen can commercially distribute the Avance® Nerve Graft  until the FDA makes a final determination on an Avance® Nerve Graft BLA submission, assuming AxoGen remains in compliance with the transition plan and exercises due diligence in executing the transition plan. In the event that the FDA becomes dissatisfied with AxoGen's progress or actions with respect to the transition plan or the FDA changes its position for any reason regarding its use of enforcement discretion to permit AxoGen to distribute Avance® Nerve Graft product in accordance with the transition plan, AxoGen would no longer be able to distribute Avance® Nerve Graft, which would have a material adverse effect on AxoGen's operations and financial viability. In addition, if AxoGen does not meet the conditions of the transition plan, or fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the FDA could impose civil penalties, including fines, product seizures, injunctions or product recalls and, in certain cases, criminal sanctions.  These consequences also would have a material adverse effect on AxoGen's operations and financial viability.. AxoGen's business is subject to continuing compliance to standards by various accreditation and registration bodies which is costly and loss of accreditation or registration could result in negative effects on its business.. AxoGen is subject to accreditation such as that by the AATB and as a Verified-Accredited Wholesale Distributor.  AxoGen has registration requirements such as that with the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and ISO 13485 registration bodies.  These accreditations and regulations can affect distribution and sale of AxoGen products on a state-by-state basis, within the United States and also affects distribution and sale of AxoGen products outside of the United States. The loss of accreditation or registration could keep AxoGen from selling and distributing its product which may have negative effects on its business.. AxoGen's AxoGuard® and Avive® products are subject to FDA and other regulatory requirements.. AxoGen's AxoGuard® product line is regulated as a medical device under the FD&C Act and subject to premarket notification and clearance requirements under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, 21 CFR Part 820 (Quality System Regulation) and other FDA regulations. AxoGen distributes for Cook Biotech the AxoGuard® product line and Cook. 48. Table of Contents. Biotech is responsible for the regulatory compliance of the AxoGuard® Connector and Protector product lines. Cook Biotech has obtained a 510(k) premarket clearance from the FDA for porcine (pig) small intestine submucosa for the repair of peripheral nerve discontinuities where gap closure can be achieved by flexion of the extremity. Cook Biotech has also obtained a 510(k) premarket clearance for the AxoGuard® Nerve Protector for the repair of peripheral nerve damage in which there is no gap or where a gap closure is achieved by flexion of the extremity.  AxoGen is responsible for the regulatory compliance of the AxoGuard® Nerve Cap.  AxoGen has obtained a 510(k) premarket clearance for AxoGuard® Nerve Cap to protect a peripheral nerve end and separate the nerve from the surrounding environment to reduce the development of symptomatic or painful neuroma.  If AxoGen or Cook Biotech fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the FDA could deny or withdraw 510(k) clearance for the AxoGuard® products, or impose civil penalties, including fines, product seizures or product recalls and, in certain cases, criminal sanctions.. Avive® Soft Tissue Membrane is processed and distributed in accordance with U.S. FDA requirements for Human Cellular and Tissue-based Products (HCT/P) under 21 CFR Part 1271 regulations, U.S. State regulations and the guidelines of the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB). If AxoGen fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the FDA could require AxoGen to stop providing Avive®, or impose civil penalties, including fines, product seizures or product recalls and, in certain cases, criminal sanctions.. AxoGen's AxoTouch® and AcroVal® products are subject to FDA and other regulatory requirements.. AxoGen's AxoTouch® and AcroVal® products are regulated as medical devices under the FD&C Act and subject to premarket notification and clearance requirements under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, 21 CFR Part 820 (Quality System Regulation) and other FDA regulations.  If AxoGen fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the FDA could deny or withdraw 510(k) clearance for these products, or impose civil penalties, including fines, product seizures or product recalls and, in certain cases, criminal sanctions.. Defective AxoGen product could lead to recall or other negative business conditions.. If AxoGen's products are defective or otherwise pose safety risks, the FDA could require their recall or AxoGen may initiate a voluntary recall of its products. The FDA may require recall of a marketed medical device product, such as the AxoGuard® products, in the event that it determines the medical device presents a reasonable probability of serious adverse health consequences or death. However, most device recalls do not rise to this level of health significance and result from voluntary action. The FDA has authority to recall biological products when a batch, lot or other quantity of the product presents an imminent or substantial hazard to the public health.  However, in such circumstances, the FDA usually initially requests, voluntary recalls of biological products, such as the Avance® Nerve Graft. If a company does not comply with an FDA request for a recall, the FDA can order one under the above-referenced circumstances or take other enforcement actions, such as product seizure. In addition, manufacturers may, on their own initiative, recall a product to remove or correct a deficiency or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act that may pose a risk to health. A government-mandated, government-requested or voluntary recall could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, reports of safety issues, failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls and other field corrections for any of AxoGen's products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. A recall could harm AxoGen's reputation with customers and negatively affect its sales. AxoGen may initiate recalls involving some of its products in the future that it determines do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA were to disagree with AxoGen's determinations, it could request that it report those actions as recalls, and take regulatory or enforcement action against AxoGen or the product.. If AxoGen's products cause or contribute to a death, a serious injury or any adverse reaction involving a communicable disease related to its products, or malfunction in certain ways, it will be subject to reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions. See \"Business  -  Regulation  -  Education Grants, U.S. Anti-kickback, False Claims and Other Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws  -  Pervasive and False Claims.\"  If AxoGen fails to report these events to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, the FDA could take regulatory or enforcement action against AxoGen. Any adverse event involving AxoGen's products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection, mandatory recall or other enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as. 49. Table of Contents. well as AxoGen defending itself in a lawsuit, would require the dedication of time and capital, distract management from operating its business, and may harm AxoGen's reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.. AxoGen's operations must comply with FDA and other governmental requirements.. AxoGen's operations require it to comply with the FDA's and other governmental authorities' laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and production of medical products, which is costly and could subject AxoGen to enforcement action. See \"Business  -  Government Regulations  -  Education Grants, U.S. Anti-kickback, False Claims and Other Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws  -  Fraud, Abuse and False Claims\". Any of these actions could impair AxoGen's ability to produce its products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet customer demands. AxoGen may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have an adverse impact on its future revenue and its ability to generate profits. Furthermore, AxoGen's key material suppliers, licensors and or other contractors may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, which could result in AxoGen's failure to produce its products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.. Distribution of AxoGen human tissue products outside the U.S. are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary from country to country. In the European Union (\"E.U.\"), human tissue regulations, if applicable, differ from one E.U. member state to the next. Because of the absence of a harmonized regulatory framework and the proposed regulation for advanced therapy medicinal products in the E.U., as well as for other countries, the approval process for human derived cell or tissue based medical products may be extensive, lengthy, expensive and unpredictable. AxoGen products will be subject to E.U. member states' regulations that govern the donation, procurement, testing, coding, traceability, processing, preservation, storage, and distribution of human tissues and cells and cellular or tissue-based products. In addition, some E.U. member states have their own tissue banking regulations. The inability to meet foreign regulatory requirements could materially affect AxoGen's future growth and compliance with such requirements could place a significant financial burden on AxoGen.. In addition, the United Kingdom voted to exit the European Union (\"Brexit\") and the timing and scope remain unclear. AxoGen's current notified body for its CE Mark for AxoGuard® products is in the United Kingdom.  To date there is no business disruption, but AxoGen cannot be sure what changes could occur. If the notified body must change to a E.U. member there could be an interruption in sales in the E.U.  Cost of regulatory compliance with both the United Kingdom and E.U. could be significant and time consuming.. Finally, regulations in both the United States and other countries are subject to constent change.  There can be no assurance that AxoGen can meet the requirements of future regulations or that compliance with current regulations assures future capability to distribute and sell its products.. Clinical trials can be long, expensive and ultimately uncertain which could jeopardize AxoGen's ability to obtain regulatory approval and continue to market its Avance® Nerve Graft product.. AxoGen is required to perform a clinical trial for its Avance® Nerve Graft under FDA's statutory requirements to obtain approval of a BLA for the product. This trial is expensive, is expected to take several years to execute, and is subject to factors within and outside of AxoGen's control. The outcome of this trial is uncertain.. AxoGen submitted an IND for the Avance® Nerve Graft in April 2013 and received FDA approval in March 2015.   The phase 3 clinical trial was initiated in the second quarter of 2015. Additionally, AxoGen was audited by the FDA at its processing facility in March 2013, March 2015 and October 2016 and its Distribution Facility in October 2015.  The quality system was found to be in compliance with 21 CFR Part 1271. AxoGen is working to ensure compliance with the applicable regulations by having ongoing discussions on the transition of the quality system to 21 CFR Parts 210/211 and 600-610 regulations with the FDA. Final determination of regulatory compliance with 21 CFR Parts 210/211 and 600-610 will be made during FDA's pre-license inspection as part of the BLA review. If the FDA is unable to agree with AxoGen, or AxoGen is unable to meet the standards required of it by the FDA, regarding preclinical studies, clinical studies and CMC, the approval of AxoGen's BLA would not occur or be delayed.. 50. Table of Contents. AxoGen continues to work diligently with the FDA and, in this context, continues to distribute the Avance® Nerve Graft products.  The FDA will end the period of enforcement discretion upon a final determination of AxoGen's BLA submission or if the FDA finds that AxoGen does not meet the conditions for the transition plan or is not exercising due diligence in executing the transition (e.g., not progressing toward the IND submission, study completion, or BLA submission in a timely or adequate fashion).  If final action on the BLA is negative or AxoGen is found to not meet the conditions for the transition plan or its execution, AxoGen will not be able to continue to distribute the Avance® Nerve Graft, and AxoGen's business and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.. The results of non-clinical studies do not necessarily predict future clinical trial results and predecessor clinical trial results may not be repeated in subsequent clinical trials. Additionally, the FDA may disagree with AxoGen's interpretation of the data from its non-clinical studies and clinical trials and may require the company to pursue additional non-clinical studies or clinical trials, or not approve AxoGen's BLA. If AxoGen is unable to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of its product through its clinical trials, it will be unable to obtain regulatory approval to market the Avance® Nerve Graft and will not be able to continue to provide it.. AxoGen will rely on third parties to conduct its clinical trial and they may not perform as contractually required or expected.. AxoGen will rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations (\"CROs\"), medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct its clinical trial and certain nonclinical studies. AxoGen and its CROs are required to comply with all applicable regulations governing clinical research, including good clinical practice, or GCP. The FDA enforces these regulations through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, CROs and trial sites. If AxoGen or its CROs fail to comply with applicable FDA regulations, the data generated in its clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require AxoGen to perform additional clinical trials before approving its applications. AxoGen cannot be certain that, upon inspection, the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities will determine that AxoGen's clinical trial complies or complied with clinical trial regulations, including GCP. In addition, AxoGen's clinical trial must be conducted with product produced under applicable cGMP regulations. Failure to comply with the clinical trial regulations may require AxoGen to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if these third parties need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to AxoGen's clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, AxoGen's non-clinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and it would not be able to obtain regulatory approval for its products on a timely basis, if at all, and its business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects would be adversely affected. Furthermore, AxoGen's third party clinical trial investigators may be delayed in conducting its clinical trials for reasons outside of their control.. U.S. governmental regulation could restrict the use of AxoGen's Avance® Nerve Graft and Avive® Soft Tissue Membrane product, restrict AxoGen's procurement of tissue or increase costs.. In addition to the FDA requirements for biological products, the Avance® Nerve Graft will continue to be subject to, as is the Avive® Soft Tissue Membrane, various requirements for human tissue under 21 CFR Part 1271 controls. Human tissues intended for transplantation have been regulated by the FDA since 1993. In May 2005, three new comprehensive regulations went into effect that address manufacturing activities associated with HCT/P. The first regulation requires that companies that produce and distribute HCT/Ps register with the FDA. The second regulation provides criteria that must be met for donors to be eligible to donate tissues and is referred to as the \"Donor Eligibility\" rule. The third regulation governs the processing and distribution of the tissues and is often referred to as the \"Current Good Tissue Practices\" rule. The Current Good Tissue Practices rule covers all stages of allograft processing, from procurement of tissue to distribution of final allografts. Together, the three basic requirements of 21 CFR Part 1271 are designed to ensure that sound, high quality practices are followed to reduce the risk of tissue contamination and of communicable disease transmission to recipients. These regulations increased regulatory scrutiny within the industry in which AxoGen operates and have led to increased enforcement actions, which affects the conduct of its business.    In addition, new guidance was issued by the FDA in late 2017 on Regulatory Considerations for Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products: Minimal Manipulation and Homologous Use. FDA actions interpreting the. 51. Table of Contents. guidance will need to be followed closely, and the potential implications on the regulatory status of Avive® and future HCT/P products is being evaluated by the Company.. Additional regulations or guidance documents may be implemented by the FDA in the future.  These changes may require new documentation requirements, process changes or testing that could increase costs and regulatory burden.  See \"Business  -  Government Regulations.\"  These regulations can also increase the cost of tissue recovery activities. Finally, Avance® Nerve Graft and Avive® Soft Tissue Membrane are subject to certain state and local regulations, as well as compliance with the standards of the tissue bank industry's accrediting organization, the AATB.. The procurement and transplantation of allograft nerve tissue is also subject to federal law pursuant to the National Organ Transplant Act (\"NOTA\"), a criminal statute which prohibits the purchase and sale of human organs used in human transplantation, including nerve and related tissue, for \"valuable consideration.\" NOTA only permits reasonable payments associated with the removal, transportation, processing, preservation, quality control, implantation and storage of human nerve tissue. AxoGen makes payments to certain of its clients and tissue banks for their services related to recovering allograft nerve and umbilical cord tissue on its behalf. If NOTA is interpreted or enforced in a manner which prevents AxoGen from receiving payment for services it renders, or which prevents it from paying tissue banks or certain of its clients for the services they render for AxoGen, its business could be materially and adversely affected.. AxoGen has engaged, through its marketing employees, independent sales agents and sales representatives in ongoing efforts designed to educate the medical community as to the benefits of AxoGen products, and AxoGen intends to continue its educational activities. Although AxoGen believes that NOTA permits payments in connection with these educational efforts as reasonable payments associated with the processing, transportation and implantation of AxoGen products, payments in connection with such education efforts are not exempt from NOTA's restrictions and AxoGen's inability to make such payments in connection with its education efforts may prevent it from paying AxoGen sales representatives for their education efforts and could adversely affect AxoGen's business and prospects. No federal agency or court has determined whether NOTA is, or will be, applicable to every allograft nerve tissue-based material which AxoGen's processing technologies may generate. Assuming that NOTA applies to AxoGen's processing of allograft nerve and umbilical cord tissue, AxoGen believes that it complies with NOTA, but there can be no assurance that more restrictive interpretations of, or amendments to, NOTA will not be adopted in the future, which would call into question one or more aspects of AxoGen's method of operations.. Other regulatory entities include state agencies with statutes covering tissue banking. Regulations issued by Florida, New York, California and Maryland, among other states, are particularly relevant to AxoGen's business. Most states do not currently have tissue banking regulations. However, incidents of allograft related issues in the industry may stimulate the development of regulation in other states. It is possible that third parties may make allegations against AxoGen or against donor recovery groups or tissue banks about non-compliance with applicable FDA regulations or other relevant statutes or regulations. Allegations like these could cause regulators or other authorities to take investigative or other action, or could cause negative publicity for AxoGen's business and the industry in which it operates.. Healthcare policy changes may have a material adverse effect on AxoGen.. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, which Act substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and encourages improvements in the quality of healthcare items and services. This Act significantly impacts the biotechnology and medical device industries and could have a material adverse impact on numerous aspects of AxoGen's business.. This Act includes, among other things, the following measures:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the U.S., with limited exceptions, beginning in 2013, referred to as the Device Tax, which has been suspended through 2019;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research;. 52. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnew reporting and disclosure requirements on healthcare manufacturers for any \"transfer of value\" made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as reporting of certain physician ownership interests (\"Sunshine Act\");. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpayment system reforms, including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tan independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to reduce Medicare spending if projected Medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta new abbreviated pathway for the licensure of biologic products that are demonstrated to be biosimilar or biosimilar and interchangeable with a licensed biologic product.. There are also a number of states (such as Vermont, Massachusetts, Minnesota) with their own Sunshine Acts that implement the reporting and disclosure requirements on healthcare manufacturers for any \"transfer of value\" made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as reporting of certain physician ownership interests.. In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system. Certain of these proposals could limit the prices AxoGen is able to charge for its products or the amounts of reimbursement available for its products and could also limit the acceptance and availability of its products. The adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on AxoGen's business, results of operations and financial condition.. Additionally, initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where AxoGen does business. AxoGen could experience an adverse impact on operating results due to increased pricing pressure in the U.S. and in other markets. Governments, hospitals and other third-party payors could reduce the amount of approved reimbursement for AxoGen's products or deny coverage altogether. Reductions in reimbursement levels or coverage or other cost-containment measures could unfavorably affect AxoGen's future operating results.. Risks Related to AxoGen's Intellectual Property. Failure to protect AxoGen's IP rights could result in costly and time-consuming litigation and its loss of any potential competitive advantage.. AxoGen's success will depend, to a large extent, on its ability to successfully obtain and maintain patents, prevent misappropriation or infringement of IP, maintain trade secret protection, and conduct operations without violating or infringing on the IP rights of third parties. See \"Business  -  Intellectual Property.\" There can be no assurance that AxoGen's patented and patent pending technologies will provide it with a competitive advantage, that AxoGen will be able to develop or acquire additional technology that is patentable, or that third parties will not develop and offer technologies which are similar to AxoGen's. Moreover, AxoGen can provide no assurance that confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants and other parties, trade secrecy agreements or similar agreements intended to protect unpatented technology will provide the intended protection. IP litigation is extremely expensive and time-consuming, and it is often difficult, if not impossible, to predict the outcome of such litigation. A failure by AxoGen to protect its IP could have a materially adverse effect on its business and operating results and its ability to successfully compete in its industry.. Future protection for AxoGen's proprietary rights is uncertain which may impact its ability to successfully compete in its industry.. The degree of future protection for AxoGen's proprietary rights is uncertain. AxoGen cannot ensure that:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tit, or its licensors, were the first to make the inventions covered by each of AxoGen's patents;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tit, or its licensors, were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tothers will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of AxoGen's technologies;. 53. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany of AxoGen's pending patent applications will result in issued patents;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany of AxoGen's issued patents or those of its licensors will be valid and enforceable;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany patents issued to AxoGen or its collaborators will provide any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tit will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe patents of others will not have a material adverse effect on its business rights; or. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe measures AxoGen relies on to protect its IP underlying our products may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using its technology, all of which could harm its ability to compete in the market.. AxoGen's commercial success depends in part on its ability and the ability of its collaborators and licensors to avoid infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties which could expose it to litigation or commercially unfavorable licensing arrangements. Third parties may accuse AxoGen or collaborators and licensors of employing their proprietary technology in AxoGen products, or in the materials or processes used to research or develop AxoGen products, without authorization. Any legal action against AxoGen collaborators, licensors or it claiming damages and/or seeking to enjoin AxoGen's commercial activities relating to the affected products, materials and processes could, in addition to subjecting AxoGen to potential liability for damages, require it or its collaborators and licensors to obtain a license to continue to utilize the affected materials or processes or to manufacture or market the affected products. AxoGen cannot predict whether it or its collaborators and licensors would prevail in any of these actions or whether any license required under any of these patents would be made available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If AxoGen were unable to obtain such a license, it and its collaborators and licensors may be unable to continue to utilize the affected materials or processes, or manufacture or market the affected products, or AxoGen may be obligated by a court to pay substantial royalties and/or other damages to the patent holder. Even if AxoGen were able to obtain such a license, the terms of such a license could substantially reduce the commercial value of the affected product or products and impair AxoGen's prospects for profitability. Accordingly, AxoGen cannot predict whether, or to what extent, the commercial value of the affected product or products or AxoGen's prospects for profitability may be harmed as a result of any of the liabilities discussed above. Furthermore, infringement and other IP claims, with or without merit, can be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and can divert management's attention from its core business. AxoGen and its licensors may be unable to obtain and enforce IP rights to adequately protect its products and related IP.. The patent protection for our products may expire before we are able to maximize their commercial value which may subject us to increased competition and reduce or eliminate our opportunity to generate product revenue.. The patents for our commercialized products and products in development have varying expiration dates and, when these patents expire, we may be subject to increased competition and we may not be able to recover our development costs. For example, the material U.S. patents covering the formulations used in our AxoGuard® product line, which are held by Cook Biotech, have expired.  Expiration of these patents could adversely affect our ability to successfully execute our business strategy to maximize the value of AxoGuard® products and could negatively impact our future financial condition and results of operations.. Others may claim an ownership interest in AxoGen IP which could expose it to litigation and have a significant adverse effect on its prospects.. A third party may claim an ownership interest in one or more of AxoGen's patents or other IP. A third party could bring legal actions against AxoGen claiming it infringes their patents or proprietary rights, and seek monetary damages and/or enjoin clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing of the affected product or products. While AxoGen believes it owns the right, title and interest in the patents for which it or its licensors have applied and AxoGen's other IP (including that which is licensed from third parties), and is presently unaware of any claims or assertions by third-parties with respect to AxoGen's patents or IP, it cannot guarantee that a third party will not assert a claim or an interest in any of such patents or IP. If AxoGen becomes involved in any litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of AxoGen's resources and cause a significant diversion of effort by AxoGen's technical and management personnel regardless of the outcome of the litigation. If any of these actions were successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, AxoGen could be required to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market the affected product, in which case AxoGen may be required to pay substantial royalties or grant cross-licenses to AxoGen's patents. AxoGen cannot, however, assure you that any such license will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Ultimately, AxoGen could be. 54. Table of Contents. prevented from commercializing a product or be forced to cease some aspect of its business operations as a result of claims of patent infringement or violation of other IP rights, which could have a material and adverse effect on AxoGen's business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, the outcome of IP litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance, including the demeanor and credibility of witnesses and the identity of the adverse party. This is especially true in IP cases that may turn on the testimony of experts as to technical facts upon which experts may reasonably disagree.. AxoGen depends on maintenance of exclusive licenses.. AxoGen depends fundamentally on keeping and satisfying the terms of exclusive licenses of its nerve repair technologies from UFRF and UTA where the original technologies are purported to have been invented. Though AxoGen makes an effort to follow these agreements strictly, a disagreement between AxoGen and either party could have a  negative impact on its ability to operate its business effectively. In addition, AxoGen could learn that the technologies it has licensed from UFRF and UTA do not perform as purported, are not efficacious, or are not the property of UFRF or UTA, or some similar problem with the license, any of which would have an immediate and negative impact on AxoGen's business.. AxoGen Trademarks are Valuable. In the U.S. and other countries, we currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending, any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third party objection, which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the same. As our products mature, our reliance on our trademarks to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result, if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights, our business could be materially adversely affected.. Risks Related to Our Common Stock. An active trading market in our common stock may not be maintained.. The trading market in our common stock has been extremely volatile. The quotation of our common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market does not assure that a meaningful, consistent and liquid trading market will exist. We cannot predict whether an active market for our common stock will be maintained in the future. An absence of an active trading market could adversely affect our shareholders' ability to sell our common stock at current market prices in short time periods, or possibly at all. Additionally, market visibility for our common stock may be limited and such lack of visibility may have a depressive effect on the market price for our common stock. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 8.56% of our outstanding shares of common stock was held by our officers, directors, beneficial owners of 5% or more of our securities and their respective affiliates, which adversely affects the liquidity of the trading market for our common stock, in as much as federal securities laws restrict sales of our shares by these shareholders. If our affiliates continue to hold their shares of common stock, there will be limited trading volume in our common stock, which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares or increase the volatility of our stock price.. The price of AxoGen's common stock could be highly volatile due to a number of factors, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \"AXGN.\"  The stock market in general, and the market for medical technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.  The trading price of our common stock has experienced substantial volatility and is likely to continue to be highly volatile in response to a number of factors including, without limitation, the following:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimited daily trading volume resulting in the lack of a liquid market;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in price and volume due to investor speculation and other factors that may not be tied to the financial performance of AxoGen;. 55. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tperformance by AxoGen in the execution of its business plan;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfinancial viability;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactual or anticipated variations in our operating results;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements of developments by us or our competitors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmarket conditions in our industry;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadditions or departures of key personnel;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tintroduction of new products by us or our competitors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsales of our common stock or other securities in the open market;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory developments in both the United States and foreign countries;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tperformance of products sold and advertised by licensees in the marketplace;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teconomic and other external factors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tperiod-to-period fluctuations in financial results; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother events or factors, including the other factors described in this \"Risk Factors\" section, many of which are beyond our control.. The stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations. In the past, and several recent situations, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has been initiated against such company. Litigation initiated against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management's attention and resources, which could harm our business and financial condition.. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.. The operation and expansion of our business will continue to require funding. In addition, the MC Term Loan Agreement and Revolving Loan Agreement prohibit us from paying cash dividends to our shareholders. Accordingly, we do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, if any investor purchases shares of common stock, realization of a gain on such investment will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock.. Anti-takeover provisions in Minnesota law may deter acquisition bids for us that you might consider favorable.. We are governed by the provisions of Sections 302A.671, 302A.673 and 302A.675 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act (the \"MBCA\"). These provisions may discourage a negotiated acquisition or unsolicited takeover of us and deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to sell their common stock at a premium over the market price.. In general, Section 302A.671 of the MBCA provides that a corporation's shares acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights unless voting rights are approved in a prescribed manner. A \"control share acquisition\" is a direct or indirect acquisition of beneficial ownership of shares that would, when added to all other shares beneficially owned by the acquiring person, entitle the acquiring person to have voting power of 20% or more in the election of directors.. In general, Section 302A.673 of the MBCA prohibits a public Minnesota corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of four years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The term \"business combination\" includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested shareholder. An \"interested shareholder\" is a person who is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of a corporation's voting stock or who is an affiliate or associate of the corporation, and who, at any time within four years before the date in question, was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the. 56. Table of Contents. corporation's voting stock. Section 302A.673 does not apply if a committee of our Board of Directors consisting of all of its disinterested directors (excluding current and former officers) approves the proposed transaction or the interested shareholder's acquisition of shares before the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder.. If a tender offer is made for our common stock, Section 302A.675 of the MBCA precludes the offeror from acquiring additional shares of stock (including in acquisitions pursuant to mergers, consolidations or statutory share exchanges) within two years following the completion of the tender offer, unless shareholders selling their shares in the later acquisition are given the opportunity to sell their shares on terms that are substantially the same as those contained in the earlier tender offer. Section 302A.675 does not apply if a committee of our Board of Directors consisting of all of its disinterested directors (excluding its current and former officers) approves the proposed acquisition before any shares are acquired pursuant to the earlier tender offer."
