[1] "ITEM 1A.            Risk Factors.. Significant factors that could impact the Company's financial condition or results of operations include, without limitation, the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk related to freight and delivery of products to customers  -  The Company has experienced increasing freight and delivery costs which are driven by a shortage of delivery trucks and truck drivers. The Company expects this trend of higher over-the-road truck freight and delivery expenses to continue in 2018, and uncertainties exist as to how this imbalance of supply and demand will be resolved. The Company may not be able to offset these cost increases or pass such cost increases onto customers in the form of price increases, or the Company may not be able to make timely delivery of products to its customers, all of which could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk of changes in the price and availability of raw materials - The principal ingredients used by the Company are subject to price volatility. Although the Company engages in commodity hedging transactions and annual supply agreements as well as leveraging the high volume of its annual purchases, the Company may experience price increases in these ingredients that it may not be able to offset, which could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. In addition, although the Company has historically been able to procure sufficient supplies of its ingredients, market conditions could change such that adequate supplies might not be available or only become available at substantially higher costs. Adverse weather patterns, including the effects of climate change, could also significantly affect the cost and availability of these ingredients..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk of changes in product performance and competition - The Company competes with other well-established manufacturers of confectionery products. A failure of new or existing products to be favorably received, a failure to retain preferred shelf space at retail or a failure to sufficiently counter aggressive promotional and price competition could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk of discounting and other competitive actions - Discounting and pricing pressure by the Company's retail customers and other competitive actions could make it more difficult for the Company to maintain its operating margins. Actions taken by major customers and competitors may make shelf space less available for confectionary products or some of the Company's products..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk of pricing actions  -  Inherent risks in the marketplace, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of pricing actions or product weight changes, could make it more difficult for the Company to maintain its sales and operating margins..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk related to seasonality - The Company's sales are highest during the Halloween season. Adverse circumstances surrounding Halloween, such as widespread weather events at that time of year or general changes in consumer interest in Halloween, could significantly affect the Company's sales..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk of dependence on large customers - The Company's largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately 24.0% of net product sales in 2017, and other large national chains are also material to the. 5. Table of Contents. Company's sales. The loss of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or one or more other large customers, or a material decrease in purchases by one or more large customers, could result in decreased sales and adversely impact the Company's results of operations and financial condition..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk of changes in consumer preferences and tastes - Failure to adequately anticipate and react to changing demographics, consumer trends, consumer health concerns and product preferences, including product ingredients, could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk of economic conditions on consumer purchases - The Company's sales are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions, consumer confidence, employment levels, disposable income, availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit, consumer debt levels, energy costs and other factors. Volatility in food and energy costs, rising unemployment and/or underemployment, declines in personal spending, and recessionary economic conditions could adversely impact the Company's revenues, profitability and financial condition..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisks related to environmental matters - The Company's operations are not particularly impactful on the environment, but,  increased government environmental regulation or legislation could adversely impact the Company's profitability..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisks relating to participation in the multi-employer pension plan for certain Company union employees - As outlined in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and discussed in the Management's Discussion and Analysis , the Company participates in a multi-employer pension plan (Plan) which is currently in \"critical and declining status\", as defined by applicable law. A designation of \"critical and declining status\" implies that the Plan is expected to become insolvent by the year 2030. Under terms of a rehabilitation plan, the Company is to be assessed 5% annual compounded surcharges on its contributions to the Plan until such time as the Plan emerges from critical status. Should the Company withdraw from the Plan, it would be subject to a significant withdrawal liability which is discussed in Note 7 of the Company's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis. The Company is currently unable to determine the ultimate outcome of this matter and therefore, is unable to determine the effects on its consolidated financial statements, but, the ultimate outcome could be material to its consolidated results of operations in one or more future periods..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk of new governmental laws and regulations - Governmental laws and regulations, including those that affect food advertising and marketing to children, use of certain ingredients in products, new labeling requirements, income and other taxes and tariffs, including the effects of possible changes to international trade agreements that could affect products manufactured in Canada and sold in the U.S.A. and imported raw materials, new taxes targeted toward confectionery products and the environment, both in and outside the U.S.A., are subject to change over time, which could adversely impact the Company's results of operations and ability to compete in domestic or foreign marketplaces..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk of labor stoppages - To the extent the Company experiences any significant labor stoppages, such disputes or strikes could negatively affect shipments from suppliers or shipments of finished product. The Company's union labor agreement at its Chicago plant is currently in negotiations and the Company is operating under an extension of its prior labor agreement. The Company anticipates that a new five year agreement will be completed in the first or second quarter of 2018. This timeline is generally consistent with prior contract negotiations..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk of impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets - In accordance with authoritative guidance, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to an impairment evaluation annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of a triggering event. Other long-lived assets are likewise tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event. Such evaluations are based on assumptions and variables including sales growth, profit margins and discount rates. Adverse changes in any of these variables could affect the carrying value of these intangible assets and the Company's reported profitability..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk of the cost of energy increasing - Higher energy costs would likely result in higher plant overhead, distribution, freight and other operating costs. The Company may not be able to offset these cost increases or pass. 6. Table of Contents. such cost increases onto customers in the form of price increases, which could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk of a product recall - Issues related to the quality and safety of the Company's products could result in a voluntary or involuntary large-scale product recall. Costs associated with a product recall and related litigation or fines, and marketing costs relating to the re-launch of such products or brands, could negatively affect operating results. In addition, negative publicity associated with this type of event, including a product recall relating to product contamination or product tampering, whether valid or not, could negatively impact future demand for the Company's products..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk of operational interruptions relating to computer software or hardware failures - The Company is reliant on computer systems to operate its business. Software failure or corruption, including cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, or catastrophic hardware failures or other disasters could disrupt communications, supply chain planning and activities relating to sales demand forecasts, materials procurement, production and inventory planning, customer shipments, and financial and accounting, all of which could negatively impact sales and profits..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk of releasing sensitive information  -  Although the Company does not maintain a large amount of sensitive data, a system breach, whether inadvertent or perpetrated by hackers, could result in identity theft which could expose the Company to financial costs and adversely affect profitability..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk of production interruptions - The majority of the Company's products are manufactured in a single production facility on specialized equipment. In the event of a disaster, such as a fire or earthquake, at a specific plant location, it would be difficult to transfer production to other facilities or a new location in a timely manner, which could result in loss of market share for the affected products. In addition, from time to time, the Company upgrades or replaces this specialized equipment. In many cases these are integrated and complex installations. A failure or delay in implementing such an installation could impact the availability of one or more of the Company's products which would have an adverse impact on sales and profits..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk related to international operations - To the extent there is political or social unrest, civil war, terrorism or significant economic instability in the countries in which the Company operates, the results of the Company's business in such countries could be adversely impacted. Currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could also have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. The Company's principal markets are the U.S.A., Canada, and Mexico..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk related to investments in marketable securities - The Company invests its surplus cash in a diversified portfolio of highly rated marketable securities, including corporate and tax exempt municipal bonds, with maturities of generally up to three years,  and variable rate demand notes with weekly resets of interest rates and \"puts' to redeem the investment each week. Nonetheless, such investments could become impaired in the event of certain adverse economic and/or geopolitical events which, if severe, would adversely affect the Company's financial condition..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDisruption to the Company's supply chain could impair the Company's ability to produce or deliver its finished products, resulting in a negative impact on operating results - Disruption to the manufacturing operations or supply chain, some of which are discussed above, could result from, but are not limited to natural disasters, pandemic outbreak of disease, weather, fire or explosion, earthquakes, terrorism or other acts of violence, unavailability of ingredients or packaging materials, labor strikes or other labor activities, operational and/or financial instability of key suppliers, and other vendors or service providers. Although precautions are taken to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions, if the Company is unable, or if it is not financially feasible to effectively mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such disruptive events, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk related to acquisitions  -  From time to time, the Company has purchased other confectionery companies or brands. These acquisitions generally come at a high multiple of earnings and are justified based on various. 7. Table of Contents. assumptions related to sales growth, and operating margins. Were the Company to make another acquisition and be unable to achieve the assumed sales and operating margins, it could have an adverse impact on future sales and profits. In addition it could become necessary to record an impairment which would have a further adverse impact on reported profits..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk of further losses in Spain  -  The Company has restructured its Spanish subsidiaries and is exploring a variety of programs to increase sales and profitability. However, the outcome of these efforts thus far have not been successful and additional losses and impairments are likely to be reported from these business units. See also Management's Discussion and Analysis..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk of \"slack fill\" litigation - The Company, as well as other confectionary and food companies, have experienced an increasing number of plaintiff claims that certain products are sold in boxes that are not completely full, and therefore such \"slack filled\" products are misleading, and even deceptive, to the consumer. Although the Company believes that these claims are without merit, the Company could be exposed to significant legal fees to defend its position, and in the event that it is not successful, could be subject to fines and costs of settlement, including class action settlements..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe Company is a controlled company due to the common stock holdings of the Gordon family - The Gordon family's share ownership represents a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of the Company's common stock as of December 31, 2017. As a result, the Gordon family has the power to elect the Company's directors and approve actions requiring the approval of the shareholders of the Company.. The factors identified above are believed to be significant factors, but not necessarily all of the significant factors, that could impact the Company's business.  Unpredictable or unknown factors could also have material effects on the Company.. Additional significant factors that may affect the Company's operations, performance and business results include the risks and uncertainties listed from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the risk factors or uncertainties listed herein or listed in any document incorporated by reference herein."
