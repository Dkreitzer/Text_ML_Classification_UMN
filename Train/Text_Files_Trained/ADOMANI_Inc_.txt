[1] "Item 1A.      RISK FACTORS. Investing in our securities involves significant risks, including the potential loss of all or part of your investment.  These risks could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cause a decline in the market price of our common stock.  You should carefully consider all of the risks described in this Annual Report, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report, before you make an investment in our securities.  In addition to other matters identified or described by us from time to time in filings with the SEC, there are several important factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results or trends, results anticipated or planned by us, or results that are reflected from time to time in any forward-looking statement. Some of these important factors, but not necessarily all important factors, include the following:. Risks Related to Our Business. We may not successfully execute our business plan to generate revenue and create a sustainable growth trajectory.. We have not generated significant revenues to date. Our ability to generate revenue and grow our revenue will depend, in part, on our ability to execute on our business plan, expand our business model and develop new products in a timely manner. We may fail to do so. A variety of factors outside of our control could affect our ability to generate revenue and our revenue growth. Our success in implementing our strategy of producing zero-emission conversions and selling new zero-emission buses, trucks and other fleet vehicles could also slow our revenue growth.. We have a history of losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.. We have incurred losses in each fiscal year since our incorporation in 2012. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we incurred net losses of $21.9 million, $10.69 million, and $6.03 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $1.8 million, an accumulated deficit of $43 million and stockholders’ equity of $2.3 million. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through issuing equity capital, convertible notes, notes payable and, most recently, with the completion of an offering of our common stock. Our products have been recently developed and they may not be commercially successful or generate significant revenue, if at all. If we are to ever achieve profitability it will be dependent upon the successful development and successful commercial introduction and acceptance of zero-emission electric and hybrid drivetrains such as ours; the demand for new buses, trucks and other fleet vehicles with zero-emission or hybrid drivetrains; and the demand for conversion of existing buses, trucks and other fleet vehicles to zero-emission electric or hybrid drivetrains, any of which may not occur. We may not achieve profitability in the future as we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase significantly in the foreseeable future as we:. ·     continue to invest in research and development to enhance our zero-emission products and services;                   ·     design, develop and manufacture our drivetrains and their components;                   ·     increase our sales and marketing to acquire new customers; and                   ·     increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations.. 23. Because we will incur the costs and expenses from these efforts before we receive any significant incremental revenues with respect thereto, our losses in future periods will be significantly greater than the losses we would incur if we developed our business more slowly. In addition, these efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, or may not result in increases in our revenues, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. Even if we are successful in generating revenue and increasing our customer base, we may not become profitable in the future or may be unable to maintain any profitability achieved if we fail to increase our revenue and manage our operating expenses or if we incur unanticipated liabilities. And even if our revenue increases, we may not be able to sustain this rate of revenue growth. Revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of reasons, including lack of demand for our zero-emission systems, increasing competition, lengthening sales cycles, decelerating growth of, or declines in, our overall market, or our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities or to introduce new offerings. Any failure by us to achieve and maintain revenue or profitability could cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly.. While we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, including the net proceeds from the foregoing offerings, will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through April 2019, we may not successfully execute our business plan, and if we do not, we may need additional capital to continue our operations.. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects.. Our short operating history and developing business model make it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects. It is difficult to predict our future revenues and appropriately budget for our expenses, and we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly developing and changing industries, including challenges in forecasting accuracy, determining appropriate investments of our limited resources, market acceptance of our products and services and future products and services, competition from new and established companies, including those with greater financial and technical resources, acquiring and retaining customers and increasing revenue from existing customers, enhancing our products and services and developing new products and services. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties that we will encounter as we continue to develop our business model. We may not be able to address these risks and difficulties successfully, which would materially harm our business and operating results and cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline.. We may experience quarterly fluctuations in our operating results due to a number of factors which make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations.. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not consider our past results, including our recent success in having funding approved in California through AB 923 for conversions and new zero-emission electric or hybrid drivetrains in any projected growth rate or as indicative of our future performance.. We expect our period-to-period operating results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will increase significantly in future periods as we, among other things, design and develop our zero-emission drivetrains, open new design, sales and service facilities, hire additional technology staff, increase our travel and operational budgets, increase our facility costs, hire and train service personnel, increase our sales and marketing activities, and increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results, especially in the short-term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Moreover, our operating results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts or investors. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time.. 24. In addition to other risk factors described in this section, factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include the following: our ability to hire, train and retain key personnel, develop new products that the market demands, receive government support funding to offset the increased product cost to the end user, keep our supply chain intact, source required materials to build our zero-emission systems and maintain them once they are delivered.. Based upon all of the factors described above, we have a limited ability to forecast our future revenue, costs and expenses and, as a result, our operating results may from time to time fall below our estimates.. Our future growth is dependent upon demand for conversion of existing diesel- and gasoline-powered buses, truck and other fleet vehicles to zero-emission electric or hybrid drivetrain systems and demand for new buses, trucks and other fleet vehicles with zero-emission drivetrains.. Our growth is highly dependent upon the market acceptance of, and we are subject to an elevated risk of any reduced demand for, zero-emission vehicles and conversion of existing buses, trucks and other fleet vehicles to zero-emission electric or hybrid vehicles and the demand for new buses, truck and other fleet vehicles with zero-emission drivetrains in particular. If this market does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be harmed and we may need to raise additional capital. This market is relatively new, rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, additional competitors, evolving government regulation and industry standards, frequent new vehicle announcements and changing consumer demands and behaviors. Factors that may influence the market acceptance of zero-emission vehicles, and specifically conversion of existing buses and fleet vehicles to zero-emission electric or hybrid and the demand for new buses and fleet vehicles with zero-emission drivetrains, include:. ·     perceptions about zero-emission EV quality, safety design, performance and cost, especially if adverse events or accidents occur that are linked to the quality or safety of any EV;                   ·     perceptions about the limitations in the technology resulting in a limited range over which zero-emission EVs may be driven on a single battery charge (increases in distance requires additional batteries, which increases weight, and, at some point, too much weight diminishes the additional distance being sought before requiring a charge);                   ·     perceptions about vehicle safety in general, in particular safety issues that may be attributed to the use of advanced technology;                   ·     the availability of alternative fuel vehicles, including competitive vehicles and improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine may cause a slow-down in the demand to switch to zero-emission EVs;                   ·     the availability of service for zero-emission EVs;                   ·     the environmental consciousness of owners of diesel- and gasoline-powered buses, truck and other fleet vehicles;                   ·     changes in the cost of oil and gasoline;                   ·     government regulations and economic incentives, including a change in the administrations and legislations of federal and state governments, promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy;                   ·     access to charging stations both public and private, standardization of EV charging systems and perceptions about convenience and cost to charge an EV;                   ·     the availability of tax and other governmental incentives and rebates to purchase and operate EVs or future regulation requiring increased use of zero-emission or hybrid vehicles;                   ·     perceptions about and the actual cost of alternative fuel; and                   ·     macroeconomic factors.. 25. Additionally, we have limited experience in introducing new products. To date, we have been a research and development company and we have only recently commenced production and deliveries of our products. To the extent that we are not able to build our products in accordance with customer expectations, our future sales could be harmed.. Additionally, we may become subject to regulations that may require us to alter the design of our drivetrains, which could negatively impact consumer interest in our drivetrains.. The influence of any of the factors described above may cause current or potential customers not to purchase our EVs or drivetrains, which would materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.. The market for commercial zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicles is relatively new, rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, additional competitors, evolving government regulation and industry standards, frequent new vehicle announcements and changing consumer demands and behaviors.. Most of our existing and potential competitors, including Ford, Navistar, Freightliner, PACCAR, Hino, Fuso, Volvo, BYD, Proterra, TransPower, Lion Bus or Motiv, have substantially greater financial resources, more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer service and support capabilities, longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do. They may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do. Our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market and sell their products more effectively. As a result, our competitors may be able to compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we can. Each of these competitors has the potential to capture market share in our target market, which could have an adverse effect on our position in our industry and on our business and operating results.. We expect competition in our industry to intensify in the future in light of anticipated increased demand for alternative fuel vehicles and to continued globalization and consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry. Factors affecting competition include product quality and features, innovation and development time, pricing, reliability, safety, fuel economy, customer service and financing terms. Increased competition may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Our ability to successfully compete in our industry will be fundamental to our future success in existing and new markets and to our market share. There can be no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in our markets. If our competitors introduce new products or services that compete with or surpass the quality, price or performance of our products or services, we may be unable to satisfy existing customers or attract new customers at the prices and levels that would allow us to generate attractive rates of return on our investment. A disruptive technology advancement in the EV industry by a competitor, such as in energy storage, traction motors or power electronics, could affect the sales of our products.. Demand in the zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicle industry is volatile, which may lead to lower vehicle unit sales, which could adversely affect our operating results. Volatility of demand in the zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicle industry may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. The markets in which we currently compete and plan to compete in the future have been subject to considerable volatility in demand in recent periods. As a low volume producer, we have fewer financial resources than more established providers have to withstand changes in the market and disruptions in demand. Volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. These effects may have a more pronounced impact on our business given our relatively smaller scale and financial resources as compared to many incumbent providers.. 26. Competition could result in price reductions and revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share. If we cannot compete successfully against current and future competitors, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.. Our sales cycle can be long and unpredictable and require considerable time and expense before executing a customer agreement, which may make it difficult to project when, if at all, we will obtain new customers and generate revenue from those customers.. The sales cycle for our business, from initial contact with a potential lead to contract execution and implementation, typically takes significant time and is difficult to predict. Our sales cycle in some cases has been up to six to nine months or more. Our sales efforts involve educating our customers about the use, capabilities and benefits of our products and services. Some of our customers undertake a significant evaluation process that frequently involves not only our products and services but also the offerings of our competitors. This process can be costly and time-consuming. As a result, it is difficult to predict when we will obtain new customers and begin generating revenue from these new customers. As part of our sales cycle, we may incur significant expenses before executing a definitive agreement with a prospective customer and before we are able to generate any revenue from such agreement. The substantial time and money spent on our sales efforts may not generate significant revenue. If conditions in the marketplace generally or with a specific prospective customer change negatively, it is possible that no definitive agreement will be executed, and we will be unable to recover any of these expenses. If we are not successful in targeting, supporting and streamlining our sales processes, our ability to grow our business, and our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected. If our sales cycles lengthen, our future revenue could be lower than expected, which would have an adverse impact on our consolidated operating results and could cause our stock price to decline.. Developments in alternative technologies or improvements in the internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect the demand for EVs and our drivetrains.. Significant developments in alternative technologies, such as advanced diesel, ethanol and other renewable fuels, fuel cells or compressed natural gas, or improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine, may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we do not currently anticipate. For example, fuel which is abundant and relatively inexpensive in North America, such as compressed natural gas, may emerge as consumers’ preferred alternative to petroleum-based propulsion. Any failure by us to develop new or enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes in existing technologies, could materially delay our development and introduction of new and enhanced zero-emission electric or hybrid drivetrains which could result in the loss of competitiveness of our drivetrains, decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors.. If we are unable to keep up with advances in zero-emission electric drivetrain or hybrid vehicle technology, we may suffer an inability to obtain a competitive position in the market or suffer a decline in our competitive position.. There are companies in the zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicle industry that have developed or are developing vehicles and technologies that compete or will compete with the vehicles that utilize our technology. Our competitors could be able to duplicate our technology or provide products and services similar to ours more efficiently or at greater scale. We may be unable to keep up with changes in zero-emission electric or hybrid drivetrain technology and, as a result, may suffer a decline in our competitive position. Any failure to keep up with advances in zero-emission electric or hybrid drivetrain technology would result in a decline in our competitive position, which would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. Our research and development efforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in zero-emission electric or hybrid drivetrain technology. As technologies change, we plan to upgrade or adapt our drivetrains and introduce new drivetrains in order to continue to provide drivetrains with the latest technology, in particular battery cell technology. However, our drivetrains may not compete effectively with alternatives if we are not able to source and integrate the latest technology into our drivetrains. For example, we do not manufacture most of the high cost items required for our conversion kits, including battery cells, which makes us dependent upon other suppliers of battery cell technology for our battery packs. If for any reason we are unable to keep pace with changes in commercial electric and hybrid vehicle technology, particularly battery technology, our competitive position may be adversely affected.. 27. The demand for commercial zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicles depends, in part, on the continuation of current trends resulting from historical dependence on fossil fuels. Extended periods of low diesel or other petroleum-based fuel prices could adversely affect demand for vehicles that utilize our technology, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.. We believe that much of the present and projected demand for commercial zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicles results from concerns about volatility in the cost of petroleum-based fuel, the dependency of the United States on oil from unstable or hostile countries, government regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternative forms of energy, as well as the belief that poor air quality and climate change results in part from the burning of fossil fuels. If the cost of petroleum-based fuel decreased significantly, or the long-term supply of oil in the United States improved, the government may eliminate or modify its regulations or economic incentives related to fuel efficiency and alternative forms of energy. If there is a change in the perception that the burning of fossil fuels does not negatively impact the environment, the demand for commercial zero-emission electric or hybrid vehicles could be reduced, and our business and revenue may be harmed. Diesel and other petroleum-based fuel prices have been extremely volatile, and we believe this continuing volatility will persist. Lower diesel or other petroleum-based fuel prices over extended periods of time may lower the current perception in government and the private sector that cheaper, more readily available energy alternatives should be developed and produced. If diesel or other petroleum-based fuel prices remain at deflated levels for extended periods of time, the demand for commercial electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles may decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.. We may not be able to reduce and adequately control the costs and expenses associated with operating our business, including our material and production costs.. If we are unable to reduce and/or maintain a sufficiently low level of costs for designing, manufacturing, marketing, selling and distributing and servicing our zero-emission drivetrains relative to their selling prices, our operating results, gross margins, business and prospects could be materially and adversely impacted. We have made, and will be required to continue to make, significant investments for the design, manufacture and sales of our zero-emission drivetrains. Our marginal costs of producing our drivetrains to date have exceeded our revenue from selling them. This is not expected to change for the foreseeable future until we are able to generate adequate sales volume to offset the cost of our drivetrains. Our costs of producing and delivering any future products may not be less than the revenue we generate from sales at the time we introduce any future products and we may never ever achieve a positive gross margin on sales of our zero-emission drivetrains or future products, if any.. We incur significant costs related to procuring the materials and components required to build our drivetrains and convert electric and hybrid vehicles. As a result, without including the impact of government or other subsidies and incentives, our costs and therefore the purchase prices for our commercial zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicles and/or converting commercial vehicles currently are substantially higher than the purchase prices for gas or diesel-fueled vehicles with comparable features.. Additionally, in the future we may be required to incur substantial marketing costs and expenses to promote our zero-emission drivetrains, including through the use of traditional media such as television, radio and print, even though our marketing expenses to date have been relatively limited. If we are unable to keep our operating costs aligned with the level of revenues we generate, our operating results, business and prospects will be harmed. Many of the factors that impact our operating costs are beyond our control. For example, global demand from all manufacturers of zero-emission vehicles for the same resources could create shortages and drive the costs of our raw materials and certain components, such as lithium-ion battery cells, to a higher level and reduce profit or create or increase losses. Indeed, if the popularity of zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicles exceeds current expectations without significant expansion in battery cell production capacity and advancements in battery cell technology, shortages could occur which would result in increased materials costs to us, and could also negatively impact our ability to meet production requirements if the batteries were simply not available.. If we fail to manage our anticipated growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service or address competitive challenges adequately.. 28. Any failure to manage our anticipated growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We have recently expanded our operations and further significant expansion will be required, especially in connection with kit manufacturing, service and warranty requirements. The requirements of being a public company will significantly increase our general and administrative costs. Our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage this expansion and growth successfully. Risks that we face in undertaking this expansion include:. ·     establishing sufficient sales, service and service facilities in a timely manner;                   ·     forecasting production and revenue;                   ·     training new personnel;                   ·     controlling expenses and investments in anticipation of expanded operations;                   ·     establishing or expanding design, manufacturing, sales and service facilities;                   ·     implementing and enhancing administrative infrastructure, systems and processes;                   ·     addressing new markets; and                   ·     expanding operations and finding and hiring a significant number of additional personnel, including manufacturing personnel, design personnel, engineers and service technicians.. We intend to hire a significant number of additional personnel, including design and manufacturing personnel and service technicians for our zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicles. Because vehicles that utilize our technology are based on a different technology platform than traditional internal combustion engines, individuals with sufficient training in zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicles may not be available to hire, and we may need to expend significant time and expense training the employees we do hire. Competition for individuals with experience designing, manufacturing and servicing zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicles is intense, and we may not be able to attract, assimilate, train or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future, which could seriously harm our business and prospects.. In this regard, we will be required to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting procedures and we may not be able to do so effectively. Further, to accommodate our expected growth we must continually improve and maintain our technology, systems and network infrastructure. We therefore may be unable to manage our expenses effectively in the future, which would negatively impact our gross margin or operating expenses in any particular quarter. If we fail to manage our anticipated growth and change in a manner that preserves the quality of our zero-emission systems and services and our ability to deliver in a timely manner, it will negatively affect our brand and reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract customers.. If our zero-emission electric and hybrid drivetrains fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell our drivetrains could be harmed.. Our zero-emission drivetrains or vehicles that contain our drivetrains may not perform in a manner that is consistent with our customers’ expectations for a variety of reasons. If our drivetrains or vehicles that contain our drivetrains were to contain defects in design and manufacture that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair, or any other failure of vehicles that contain our drivetrains to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in delivery delays, product recalls, product liability claims, significant warranty and other expenses, which could have a material adverse impact on our ability to develop, market and sell our zero-emission drivetrains. For example, should we have a significant sale of either new vehicles or conversion kits and a defect (from supplier-purchased product or internally assembled components) were to be discovered after delivery that could not be corrected in a timely manner, we could suffer an adverse public relations event that harms the company in a way that it may not be able to recover from, or which turns out to be so costly as to cause a significant loss. Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our drivetrains as effectively and as rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not provide satisfaction to our customers. While we have performed extensive internal testing, we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the long-term performance of our zero-emission drivetrains. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our products prior to their sale to customers. Further, the performance of our zero-emission drivetrains may be negatively impacted by other factors, such as limitations inherent in existing battery technology and extreme weather conditions. Our zero-emission drivetrains have not yet been evaluated by NHTSA for its 5-Star Safety Ratings, and while based on our internal testing we expect to obtain acceptable ratings, this may not occur.. 29. Any vehicle product defects or any other failure of our commercial zero-emission electric or hybrid drivetrains to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in delivery delays, product recalls, product liability claims, significant warranty and other expenses, customer losses and lost revenue, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.. We are dependent on third parties to deliver raw materials, parts, components and services in adequate quantity in a timely manner and at reasonable prices, quality levels, and volumes acceptable to us. Our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected if we experience disruptions in our supply chain.. We build zero-emission electric and hybrid drivetrains and conversion kits for drivetrains from components supplied by third parties. For example, we rely on third parties for batteries, traction motors, power electronics, connectors, cables, and metal fabrication for battery storage boxes. As a result, we are particularly dependent on those third parties to deliver raw materials, parts, components and services in adequate quality and quantity in a timely manner and at reasonable prices. Some components of our drivetrain systems include materials such as copper, lithium, rare-earth and strategic metals that have historically experienced price volatility and supply interruptions. In addition, we do not currently maintain long-term agreements with our suppliers with guaranteed pricing because we cannot at this time guarantee them adequate volume, which exposes us to fluctuations in component, materials and equipment prices and availability.. Furthermore, currency fluctuations weakening the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies may adversely affect our purchasing power for such raw materials, parts and components and manufacturing equipment from foreign suppliers. Substantial increases in the prices for such raw materials, components and equipment would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased prices. We may not be able to recoup these increased costs by increasing the prices of our products.. In cases where we rely on a sole supplier for a component or system, if there is an interruption of supply or increased industry demand it may be difficult for us to substitute one supplier for another, increase the number of suppliers or change one component for another in a timely manner or at all. Additionally, many of our current suppliers are small companies that produce a limited number of specialized products. If any of these suppliers were to go out of business or be acquired by a competitor of ours or any other third party that decides to discontinue our supply relationship, we would need to find an alternative supplier, which we may not be able to do. If we are unable to maintain a consistent, high quality and cost-effective supply chain, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.. This limited supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages for the production of our zero-emission electric or hybrid drivetrains. We may experience delays due to supply chain disruptions with respect to any of our zero-emission drivetrains and any other future products we may produce. In addition, our currently ongoing transition from low to high volume production tooling for our zero-emission drivetrains may take longer than expected which may adversely impact our short-term financial results.. Changes in business conditions, domestic and foreign regulations, labor issues, wars, governmental changes, natural disasters and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate, could also affect our suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis. Furthermore, if we experience significantly increased demand, or need to replace certain existing suppliers, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of component parts will be available when required on terms that are favorable to us, or that any supplier would allocate sufficient supplies to us in order to meet our requirements or fill our orders in a timely manner, or that we could engineer replacement components ourselves.. 30. Changes in our supply chain may result in increased costs in the future. We have also experienced cost increases from certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as due to design changes that we made, and we may experience similar cost increases in the future. Additionally, we are negotiating with existing suppliers for cost reductions, seeking new and less expensive suppliers for certain parts, and attempting to redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to control and reduce supplier costs, our operating results will suffer.. If we encounter unexpected difficulties with our current suppliers, and if we are unable to fill these needs from other suppliers, we could experience production delays, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.. The inability of these suppliers to deliver, or their refusal to deliver, necessary raw materials, parts and components of our zero-emission drivetrains and services in a timely manner at prices, quality levels, and volumes acceptable to us would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected if we experience disruptions in our supply chain.. The facilities or operations of our third party providers could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters or unpredictable events.. Some of our third party providers have production facilities in California, a state known for seismic activity and wildfires. If major disasters such as earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, wars, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, pandemics or other events occur, the production facilities of some of our third party providers may be seriously damaged, or they may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. We may also experience downtime due to a third party provider’s delay in production and shipment of our products due to, among other reasons, their inability to obtain supplies and materials. Either of these delays could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.. If our suppliers fail to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations, our brand image could be harmed due to negative publicity.. We do not control our independent suppliers or their business practices. A They may not comply with ethical or legal business practices, such as environmental responsibility, fair wage practices, appropriate sourcing of raw materials, and compliance with child labor laws, among others. A lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative suppliers, which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products, product shortages or other disruptions of our operations.. Violation of labor or other laws by our suppliers or the divergence of an independent supplier’s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and our brand. This could diminish the value of our brand image and reduce demand for our zero-emission drivetrains or hybrid vehicle technology if, as a result of such violation, we were to attract negative publicity. If we, or others in our industry, encounter similar problems in the future, it could harm our brand image, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.. Our business success will depend in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties. We may not be able to identify adequate strategic relationship opportunities, or form strategic relationships, in the future.. Our business success will depend in part on our ability to continue to successfully manage and enter into productive strategic relationships with third parties. We depend on various third parties to provide critical parts for our process. We currently maintain strategic relationships with all of the key manufacturers of components we require for conversion kit builds. As an example, we source our batteries from Chinese suppliers. However, several large market leaders in the battery manufacturing arena have gone out of business in the past several years which requires us to continue to vet and seek new suppliers. Maintaining and expanding our strategic relationships with third parties is critical to our continued success. Further, our relationships with these third parties are typically non-exclusive and do not prohibit the other party from working with our competitors. These relationships may not result in additional customers or enable us to generate significant revenue. Identifying suitable business partners and negotiating and documenting relationships with them require significant time and resources. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties, our ability to successfully sell our products and services, compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results would suffer.. 31. While we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships or engineer replacement components for our single source components, we may be unable to do so in the short term, or at all, at prices or costs that are favorable to us. In particular, while we believe that we will be able to secure alternate sources of supply for most of our single sourced components in a relatively short time frame, qualifying alternate suppliers or developing our own replacements for certain highly customized components of our drivetrains may be time consuming, costly and may force us to make additional modifications to a drivetrain’s design, or at a minimum require us to delay delivery of orders.. We currently have and are seeking to establish new relationships with third parties to provide alternative parts sources, such as batteries, controllers and battery management systems. For example, we continue to test additional battery manufacturers’ products in order to have back-up systems in place should our existing supplier have delivery or quality issues. In addition, this helps keep our prices in line with our competition and allows us to monitor various output and costs per unit in real time. However, we may not be able to identify or secure suitable business relationship opportunities in the future or that our competitors will not capitalize on such opportunities before we do. Our strategic relationships within China for batteries and domestically for motors and controllers will keep us competitive if maintained properly. We may not be able to offer benefits to companies that we would like to establish and maintain strategic relationships with. Moreover, identifying such opportunities could demand substantial management time and resources, and negotiating and financing relationships involves significant costs and uncertainties. If we are unable to successfully source and execute on strategic relationship opportunities in the future, our overall growth could be impaired, and our business, prospects and operating results could be materially adversely affected.. We must scale our zero-emission drivetrain manufacturing, assembling, and converting processes effectively and quickly from low volume production to high volume production.. We have no experience to date in high volume manufacturing, assembling, and converting to commercial electric and hybrid vehicles. Our existing production model utilizing third parties may not be well suited for the high-volume production we hope to require to scale our business. We do not know whether we will be able to develop efficient, low-cost manufacturing, assembly and converting capability and processes, and reliable sources of component supply that will enable us to meet the quality, price, engineering, design and production standards, as well as the production volumes required, to successfully develop our business. Any failure to develop such manufacturing, assembly and converting processes and capabilities and reliable sources of component supply within our projected costs and timelines could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.. Our ability to scale our zero-emission drivetrain manufacturing, assembling, and converting processes is in part dependent on our supply chain and on our ability to execute on our decentralized production strategy. Even if we are successful in developing our high-volume manufacturing, assembly and converting capability and processes, and reliable sources of component supply, we do not know whether we will be able to do so in a manner that avoids significant delays and cost overruns, including as a result of factors beyond our control such as problems with suppliers and vendors, or in time to meet our commercialization schedules or to satisfy the requirements of customers. In addition, certain components we integrate may not be available on a consistent basis or in large quantities. Our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected if we experience disruptions in our supply chain or if we cannot obtain materials of sufficient quality at reasonable prices.. The complexity in our business is expected to grow as we introduce new products and services. We have limited experience in simultaneously designing, testing, manufacturing, upgrading, adapting and selling our zero-emission drivetrains as well as limited experience allocating our available resources among the design and production of multiple zero-emission drivetrains. As we add complexity to our product line and introduce new products and services, we may experience unexpected delays.. 32. If we are unable to scale our existing assembly processes and systems quickly while maintaining our current quality level, including as a result of supply chain constraints and inability to manage complexity in our business, we may be unable to meet our customers’ vehicle quality and quantity requirements or our forecasted production schedule or lower our cost of sales. As a result, we may not be able to meet our customers’ delivery schedules and could face the loss of customers, or be exposed to liability to customers to which we promised delivery, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.. We may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims.. We may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims. The zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicle industry experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our zero-emission drivetrains do not perform as expected or malfunction and personal injury or death results. Our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the limited field experience of our zero-emission systems, number of vehicles delivered to date and limited field experience of those vehicles. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our drivetrains and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future vehicle candidates which would have a material adverse effect on our brand, business, prospects and operating results. We currently do not have product liability insurance coverage, as we have not sold many vehicles. We intend to add product liability insurance on a claims-made basis for all our zero-emission systems with appropriate annual limits when we commence production. However, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential product liability claims. Any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages either in excess of our coverage, or outside of our coverage, may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial condition. We may not be able to secure product liability insurance coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed, particularly if we do face liability for our products and are forced to make a claim under any policy we have.. In connection with the development and sale of our zero-emission drivetrains, we may need to comply with various safety regulations and requirements with which it may be expensive or difficult to comply. For example, we may be subject to compliance from CARB and NHTSA. In addition, we may be subject to various other federal and state-level requirements.. We may be compelled to undertake product recalls.. Any product recall in the future may result in adverse publicity, damage our brand and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We may at various times, voluntarily or involuntarily, initiate a recall if any of our zero-emission drivetrain components prove to be defective. Such recalls, voluntary or involuntary, involve significant expense and diversion of management attention and other resources, which would adversely affect our brand image in our target markets and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.. Our warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims which could adversely affect our financial performance.. If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on vehicles that utilize our technology, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. We provide a two-year warranty on parts and workmanship and a five-year warranty on batteries with every zero-emission drivetrain. Most of our warranty offering, with the exception of workmanship, is covered by the component manufacturers’ warranty. In addition, customers have the opportunity to purchase an Extended Service Plan for the period after the end of the standard warranty to cover additional services for an additional three-year period or 100,000 miles, whichever comes first. The warranty is similar to other providers’ warranty programs and is intended to cover all parts and labor to repair defects in material or workmanship in the drivetrain.  We plan to establish an initial warranty reserve of 3.0% of the cost of each delivery. We plan to record and adjust warranty reserves based on changes in estimated costs and actual warranty costs. However, because we have not yet begun delivering our first zero-emission drivetrains, and we have extremely limited operating experience with our drivetrains, we therefore have little experience with warranty claims for these zero-emission drivetrains   or with estimating warranty reserves. Once we begin initiating sales of our drivetrains, we will monitor our warranty reserves based on our actual warranty claim experience. We may be required to provide for increases in warranty reserves in the future. As of December 31, 2017, we recorded warranty reserves of $12,750 against the sale recorded in November. Our future warranty reserves may not be sufficient to cover all claims or our limited experience with warranty claims may not adequately address the needs of our customers to their satisfaction.. 33. Our insurance strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks.. We may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and other claims against us, for which we may have no insurance coverage. Additionally, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all future claims against us. A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.. If we are unable to design, develop, market and sell zero-emission electric and hybrid drivetrains and other product offerings that address additional market opportunities, our business, prospects and operating results will suffer.. We may not be able to successfully develop new zero-emission electric or hybrid drivetrains or vehicles containing them, or address new market segments or develop a broader customer base. To date, we have focused our business on the sale of zero-emission electric drivetrains and have targeted owners of buses and commercial fleets. We will need to address additional markets and expand our customer demographic in order to further grow our business. In particular, we intend to additionally target trucks (all classes inclusive of 1–8) and vans under 14,000 pounds GVWR, which is a much different market from that of our current zero-emission drivetrains. Successfully offering a drivetrain in this market requires delivering a drivetrain with different characteristics at a price that is competitive with other similar drivetrains. We have not completed the design, component sourcing or manufacturing process for these drivetrains, so it is difficult to forecast its eventual cost, manufacturability or quality. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to deliver a drivetrain that is ultimately competitive in this market at a compelling price point and in volumes as we currently intend, if at all. Our failure to address additional market opportunities would harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.. Our growth depends in part on the availability and amounts of government subsidies and incentives and the application of regulations that encourage conversion to electric or hybrid vehicles. These subsidies and incentives are limited and unpredictable and could expire or change to benefit competing technologies. We believe that the availability of government subsidies, rebates, and economic incentives is currently a critical factor considered by our customers when purchasing our zero-emission systems or converting their existing vehicles to zero-emission-electric or hybrids, and that our growth depends in large part on the availability and amounts of these subsidies and economic incentives. Any unavailability, reduction, elimination or adverse application of government subsidies, rebates, and economic incentives because of budgetary challenges, expiration, policy changes, the reduced need for such subsidies, rebates, and incentives due to the perceived success of electric or hybrid vehicles or other reasons may result in the diminished price competitiveness of the alternative fuel vehicle industry generally and our zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicles in particular, especially prior to our ability to significantly reduce our costs. For example, in the United States, we and our customers benefit from significant subsidies in connection with the purchase of our vehicles under the California HVIP, CARB, local air quality management districts, the EV Demonstration Project, and state-level Clean Cities programs. Under these programs, purchasers of qualifying vehicles and those who convert their existing vehicles are eligible to receive subsidies or incentives of up to $55,000, $71,000 and $110,000, respectively, per qualifying vehicle purchased or converted. Certain regulations and programs that encourage sales of zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicles could expire, be exhausted, be eliminated or applied in a way that adversely impacts sales of our commercial zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicles, either currently or at any time in the future. For example, the U.S. federal government and many state governments, as well as many national governments within the European Union, are facing political changes, fiscal crises and budgetary constraints, which could result in the elimination of programs, subsidies and incentives that encourage the purchase or conversion of zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicles. In addition, grants made by the DOE under the U.S. Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to clean technology companies, such as the EV Demonstration Project grant, may be subject to a high level of scrutiny in part due to recent financial difficulties experienced by recipients of DOE loan guarantees. In addition, currently some purchase subsidies are limited in total annual amounts and have been exhausted before all willing buyers have been able to consummate a purchase. We currently benefit from certain government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of zero-emission electric or hybrid vehicles. If government subsidies and economic incentives to produce and purchase zero-emission electric or hybrid vehicles were no longer available to us or our customers, or the amounts of such subsidies and incentives were reduced or eliminated, it could have a negative impact on demand for our vehicles and our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected.. 34. In addition, we anticipate that in the future there may be new opportunities for us to apply for grants, loans and other incentives from federal, state, local and foreign governments on our own behalf and on behalf of our customers. Our ability to obtain funds or incentives from government sources is subject to the availability of funds under applicable government programs and approval of our applications to participate in such programs. The application process for these funds and other incentives is and will continue to be highly competitive.. Our service model may be costly for us to operate and may not address the service requirements of our prospective customers.. Our business plan is not to develop company owned and operated service and warranty centers but to leverage existing third party bus and truck facilities to process our vehicle conversions and new vehicles. This plan may not prove to be workable and we may be forced to establish our own facilities at some point, resulting in substantial capital expenditures and increased operating costs. Zero-emission electric and hybrid commercial vehicles incorporate new and evolving technologies and require specialized service. These special service arrangements are now and in the future may continue to be costly and we may not be able to recoup the costs of providing these services to our customers. In addition, a number of potential customers may choose not to purchase our commercial zero-emission electric or hybrid vehicles because of the lack of a more widespread service network. If we are unable to satisfactorily service vehicles that utilize our technology, our ability to generate customer loyalty, grow our business and sell additional vehicles could be impaired. There can be no assurance that these service arrangements or our limited experience servicing vehicles that utilize our technology will adequately address the service requirements of our customers to their satisfaction, or that we will have sufficient resources to meet these service requirements in a timely manner as the volume of vehicles we are able to deliver annually increases. If we do not adequately address our customers’ service needs, our brand and reputation may be adversely affected, which, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.. Traditional providers do not provide maintenance and repair services directly. Customers must instead service their vehicles through franchised dealerships or through third party maintenance service providers. We are pursuing a number of agreements to provide third party service for us. However, it is unclear when or even whether such third party service providers will be able to acquire the expertise to service our zero-emission electric and hybrid commercial vehicles. As vehicles that utilize our technology are placed in more locations, we may encounter negative reactions from our customers who are frustrated that they cannot use local service stations to the same extent as they have with their conventional commercial vehicles and this frustration may result in negative publicity and reduced sales, thereby harming our business and prospects. Our decentralized assembly, sales and service model will present numerous challenges and we may not be able to execute on our plan to establish sales, service and assembly facilities in the urban areas we have targeted and our facilities in any of those markets may underperform relative to our expectations.. Our strategy of establishing sales, service, and assembly facilities in selected urban areas in the United States is substantially different from the prevailing centralized manufacturing and franchised distribution and service model used currently by our zero-emission and conversion manufacturing competitors. For example, we will not be able to utilize long established sales channels developed through a traditional franchise system to increase our sales volume, which may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Moreover, we will be competing with companies with well established distribution channels. If we determine that our decentralized model is inadequate, opening our own sales, service and assembly facility in any market generally will be capital intensive and require, among other things, establishing a local order volume that is sufficient to support the facility, finding a suitable and available location, negotiating a satisfactory lease agreement for the facility, obtaining permits and approvals from local and state authorities (which, in the case of facilities to be opened in foreign countries, may require obtaining approvals from national governments), building out the facility to our specifications and hiring and training employees to assemble, sell and service our zero-emission electric or hybrid vehicles and converting existing vehicles to zero-emission electric or hybrid vehicles. If we decide we must open our own facilities, we plan to seek state and local government incentives to defray the costs of opening facilities in the markets we have selected, but we may not be successful in this effort, or the incentives may not be as significant as we would like. As with any development project, the development and build-out of a facility will subject us to the risk of cost overruns and delays, which may be significant. Once our sales, service and assembly facilities are open for business, we will need to ensure that they maintain a high level of quality in order to satisfy customers and enhance the brand. Even if we are able to address all of the challenges discussed above, we have little experience in sales, service or assembly and our sales, service and assembly facilities in one or more markets may not adequately address customer service needs or be profitable and we may lose sales and our entire investment in such facilities, damaging our reputation in the process. If we are unable to establish the local order volume we require in order to open new sales, service and assembly facilities or are unable to successfully assemble, sell, and service our zero-emission electric and hybrid commercial vehicles adequately for customers and profitably operate these new facilities in our target markets, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected. If we do not adequately address our customers’ service needs, our brand and reputation will be adversely affected, which in turn could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.. 35. We are subject to substantial regulation, which is evolving, and unfavorable changes or any failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results.. Our commercial zero-emission electric and hybrid drivetrains, the sale of motor vehicles in general and the electronic components used in vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under international, federal, state and local laws. We may incur in the future increased costs in complying with these regulations. Regulations related to the EV industry and alternative and renewable energy currently are evolving and we face risks associated with changes to these regulations or new regulations. These risks include the following:. ·     Changes to the regulations governing the assembly, transportation and disposal of lithium-ion batteries;                   ·     Revisions in motor carrier safety laws in the United States to further enhance motor vehicle safety generally and to ensure that EVs achieve levels of safety commensurate with other cars, trucks, and buses could increase the costs associated with the component parts and the manufacture, assembly, and conversion of our drivetrains; and                   ·     Revisions in consumer protection laws to ensure that consumers are fully informed of the particular operational characteristics of vehicles could increase our costs associated with warning labels or other related customer information dissemination.. To the extent the laws governing our business and vehicles change, some or all of our zero-emission drivetrains may not comply with applicable international, federal, state or local laws, and certain of the competitive advantages of our drivetrains may be reduced or eliminated, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, compliance with changing regulations could be burdensome, time consuming, and expensive. To the extent compliance with changes in regulations or new regulations is cost prohibitive, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected.. Vehicle dealer and distribution laws could adversely affect our ability to sell our commercial zero-emission electric or hybrid vehicles.. Sales of our zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicles are subject to international, state and local vehicle dealer and distribution laws. To the extent such laws prevent us from selling our drivetrains to customers located in a particular jurisdiction or require us to retain a local dealer or distributor or establish and maintain a physical presence in a jurisdiction in order to sell drivetrains in that jurisdiction, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. We intend to contract with vehicle dealers to sell our drivetrains but we have no assurance at this time that we will successfully contract with vehicle dealers and distributors to sell our drivetrains.. 36. We may face risks associated with our international business.. We plan to develop our business internationally, including the pursuit of certain opportunities in China through our wholly-owned subsidiary, ADOMANI China. The sale and shipment of our products across international borders, as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources, would subject us to extensive United States, European Economic Area and other foreign governmental trade, import and export and customs regulations and laws. Compliance with these regulations and laws would be costly and may expose us to penalties for non-compliance. If we are successful in developing our international activities, we expect that such operations would be subject to a variety of risks, including:. ·     difficulties in staffing and managing foreign and geographically dispersed operations;                   ·     having to comply with various United States and international laws, including export control laws and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and anti-money laundering laws;                   ·     differing regulatory requirements for obtaining clearances or approvals to market our products;                   ·     changes in, or uncertainties relating to, foreign rules and regulations that may impact our ability to sell our products, perform services or repatriate profits to the United States;                   ·     tariffs and trade barriers, export regulations and other regulatory and contractual limitations on our ability to sell our products in certain foreign markets;                   ·     fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;                   ·     imposition of limitations on or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures;                   ·     imposition of differing labor laws and standards;                   ·     economic, political or social instability in foreign countries and regions;                   ·     an inability, or reduced ability, to protect our intellectual property, including our patented zero-emission drivetrain design, including any effect of compulsory licensing imposed by government action; and                   ·     availability of government subsidies or other incentives that benefit competitors in their local markets that are not available to us.. While we plan to expand into other markets in the future, our expansion plans may not be realized, or if realized, may not be successful. We expect each market to have particular regulatory and funding hurdles to overcome and future developments in these markets, including the uncertainty relating to governmental policies and regulations, could harm our business. If we expend significant time and resources on expansion plans that fail or are delayed, our reputation, business and financial condition may be harmed.. We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and cause delays in opening our sales, service and assembly facilities.. We and our operations may, once we begin production of our drivetrains through third party agreements, be subject to federal, state and/or local environmental laws and regulations, including laws relating to the use, handling, storage, transportation, disposal and human exposure to hazardous substances and wastes. Environmental and health and safety laws and regulations can be complex, and we expect that our business and operations may be affected by future amendments to such laws or other new environmental and health and safety laws which may require us to change our operations. These laws can give rise to liability for investigatory costs, administrative oversight costs, cleanup costs, property damage, bodily injury and fines and penalties. Capital and operating expenses needed to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties, third party damages, responsibilities to investigate and take corrective or remedial actions, suspension of production or a cessation of our operations.. 37. Contamination at properties we might in the future own and operate, and properties to which hazardous substances and wastes have been and may be sent by us, may result in liability for us under environmental laws and regulations, including, but not limited to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which can impose liability for the full amount of remediation-related costs without regard to fault, for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, for building contamination and impacts to human health and for damages to natural resources. The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results. We may face unexpected delays in obtaining the necessary permits and approvals required by environmental laws and regulations in connection with any planned manufacturing or operational facilities that could require significant time and financial resources and delay our ability to operate these facilities, which would adversely impact our business prospects and operating results.. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology.. Our success and ability to compete depend in part upon our intellectual property. We primarily rely on intellectual property laws, including trade secret, copyright, trademark and patent laws in the United States and abroad, and use contracts, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect our intellectual property. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate or we may be unable to secure intellectual property protection for all of our products and services.. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could use our intellectual property to market products, services or products and services similar to ours and our ability to compete effectively would be impaired. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property. Any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative processes or litigation. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful, but e these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. In addition, we might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, and could ultimately result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties.. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Effective protection of our intellectual property may not be available to us in every country in which our products and services are available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.. We could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement of another party’s intellectual property rights.. Companies, organizations or individuals, including our competitors, may hold or obtain patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to produce, use, develop or sell our zero-emission electric or hybrid vehicles or components, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. Companies in our industry are increasingly bringing and becoming subject to suits alleging infringement of proprietary rights, particularly patent rights, and our competitors may hold patents or have pending patent applications, which could be related to our business. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties, or non-practicing entities, whose sole primary business is to assert such claims. We have not received in the past, but may receive in the future, notices that claim we or our customers using our products and services have misappropriated or misused other parties’ intellectual property rights. In those cases, we intend to investigate the validity of these claims and, if we believe these claims have merit, to respond through licensing or other appropriate actions. If we are sued by a third party that claims that our technology infringes its rights, the litigation could be expensive and could divert our management resources. We do not currently have an extensive patent portfolio of our own, which may limit the defenses available to us in any such litigation.. 38. In addition, in many instances, we have agreed to indemnify our customers against certain claims that our products and services infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. The results of any intellectual property litigation to which we might become a party, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may require us to do one or more of the following:. ·     cease offering or using technologies or producing, using, developing or selling vehicles or conversions that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;                   ·     make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments or other costs or damages;                   ·     obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, to sell or use the relevant technology; or                   ·     redesign technology or vehicles that utilize our technology to avoid infringement.. If we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a result of any intellectual property infringement claims against us or any obligation to indemnify our customers for such claims, such payments or costs could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial results. Furthermore, our business could be adversely affected by any significant disputes between us and our customers as to the applicability or scope of our indemnification obligations to them.. In many of our zero-emission electric or hybrid drivetrains we use battery packs composed of lithium-ion battery cells, which, if not appropriately managed and controlled, on rare occasions have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flames. If any such events occur in our commercial EVs, we could face liability for damage or injury, adverse publicity and a potential safety recall.. The battery packs in our manufactured or converted vehicles will use lithium-ion cells, which have been used for years in laptop computers, cell phones and EVs. On rare occasions, if not appropriately managed and controlled, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. Highly publicized incidents of laptop computers, cell phones, and Tesla, Inc.’s EVs bursting into flames have focused consumer attention on the safety of these cells. More recently, a limited number of side-impact tests carried out by NHTSA on non-commercial passenger vehicles containing lithium-ion batteries and thermal management systems containing liquid coolant have resulted in post-collision fires under certain conditions. Any failure of a competitor’s EV may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our EVs. These events have raised questions about the suitability of lithium-ion cells for automotive applications. A field failure of our battery packs may occur, particularly if one of our manufactured or converted vehicles is involved in a collision, which could damage the vehicle or lead to personal injury or death and may subject us to lawsuits, product recalls, or redesign efforts, all of which would be time consuming and expensive. Furthermore, there is some risk of electrocution if individuals who attempt to repair battery packs on our manufactured or converted vehicles do not follow applicable maintenance and repair protocols. Any such damage or injury would likely lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall. Any such adverse publicity or negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of lithium-ion cells for automotive applications or any future incident involving lithium-ion cells such as a vehicle or other fire, even if such incident does not involve vehicles that utilize our technology, could seriously harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.. Unfavorable conditions in the global economy, rising interest rates and capital market liquidity issues could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results.. 39. Revenue growth and potential profitability of our business depends on the level of demand in the markets we serve. To the extent that weak economic conditions cause our customers and potential customers to freeze or reduce their capital expenditure or operational budgets, particularly those for zero-emission electric or hybrid vehicles, demand for our products and services may be negatively affected. Historically, economic downturns have resulted in overall reductions in these budgets and corresponding spending. If economic conditions deteriorate or do not materially improve, our customers and potential customers may elect to decrease their operational budgets or defer or reconsider product and service purchases, which would limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results.. Our business depends on our founders and management team, retaining and attracting qualified management, key employees and technical personnel and expanding our sales and marketing capabilities.. Our success depends upon the continued service of Mr. Reynolds, our Chairman, CEO and President, as well as other members of our senior management team. It also depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified management, technical, engineering, operating and sales and marketing personnel. We do not currently maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. While we have employment contracts with Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Menerey, our Chief Financial Officer, we do not have fixed term employment agreements with any of our other management employees, all who could terminate their relationship with us at any time. Our business also requires skilled technical, engineering, product and sales personnel, who are in high demand and are difficult to recruit and retain. As we continue to innovate and develop our products and services and develop our business, we will require personnel with expertise in these areas. There is increasing competition, especially in California, for talented individuals such as design engineers, manufacturing engineers, and other skilled employees with specialized knowledge of EVs, zero-emission electric and hybrid drivetrains and conversions. This competition affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones. Key talent may leave us due to various factors, such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive or transportation experience. Our success depends upon our ability to hire new employees in a timely manner and retain current employees. Additionally, we compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and start-ups and emerging companies that promise short-term growth opportunities. The loss of Mr. Reynolds, Mr. Menerey or any other member of our senior management team, or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the planned development and expansion of our business, could delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could materially harm our business.. The forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the markets in which we compete achieve the forecasted growth, our business may not grow at similar rates, if at all.. Growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates, which may not prove to be accurate. Forecasts relating to the expected growth in zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicles, electric and hybrid drivetrains and conversions and other markets may prove to be inaccurate. Even if these markets experience the forecasted growth, we may not grow our business at similar rates, or at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties.. We will require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.. We need sufficient capital to fund our ongoing operations and continue our development. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and will require additional funds to respond to business challenges, such as keeping pace with technological developments in order to remain competitive in our evolving industry, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. While we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, including the net proceeds from our equity offerings in June 2017 and January 2018, respectively, will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through April 2019, we will need to engage in additional equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. We do not expect to be able to satisfy our cash requirements solely through product sales in the near future, therefore we expect to rely on the net proceeds from our previous offering and this offering to fund our operations. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when and if we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth, and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired.. 40. We may selectively pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies, which could divert capital and our management’s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.. We may selectively pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies that we believe could complement or expand our applications, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated.. In addition, we have limited experience with acquiring other businesses or technologies. If we acquire businesses or technologies, we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations and technologies successfully, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including:. ·     inability to integrate or benefit from acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner;                   ·     unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition;                   ·     incurrence of acquisition-related costs;                   ·     difficulty integrating the accounting systems, operations and personnel of the acquired business;                   ·     difficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business;                   ·     difficulty converting the customers of the acquired business onto our applications and contract terms, including disparities in the revenue, licensing, support or professional services model of the acquired company;                   ·     diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;                   ·     adverse effects to our existing business relationships with business partners and customers as a result of the acquisition;                   ·     the potential loss of key employees; and                   ·     use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.. In addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations.. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. We may also unknowingly inherit liabilities from acquired businesses or assets that arise after the acquisition and that are not adequately covered by indemnities. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business and financial position may suffer.. 41. If we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected.. As a public company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements to assess and report on internal control over financial reporting until the filing of our annual report for the year ending December 31, 2018. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act), requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and, beginning with our annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, provide a management report on the internal control over financial reporting. Once we are no longer either an “emerging growth company” or a smaller reporting company, such report must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires that our principal executive officer and principal financial officer conclude as to the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures on a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2017, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Due to our size, we rely heavily on key management for day-to-day operations and internal controls, and our size and correspondingly limited resources give rise to additional internal control weaknesses, including our disclosure controls.. If we fail to detect errors on a timely basis, our financial statements may be materially misstated and if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, if and when required, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.. We are an emerging growth company and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Investors may find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” (ii) the end of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more during such fiscal year, (iii) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period or (iv) the end of the fiscal year in which the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering occurs.. We may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss or research and development tax credit carryforwards, which could adversely affect our profitability.. As of December 31, 2017, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses, which if not utilized will begin to expire from 2032 through 2036 for federal and state purposes, respectively. These net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our profitability.. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an “ownership change.” A Section 382 “ownership change” generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws.. 42. Future issuances of our stock could cause an “ownership change.” It is possible that any future ownership change could have a material effect on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our profitability.. Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.. Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.. Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Securities. The price of our common stock is and is likely to continue to be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for our stockholders and may prevent you from reselling your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares.. The market price of our common stock is and is likely to remain volatile and may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:. ·     overall performance of the equity markets;                   ·     the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock;                   ·     our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;                   ·     changes in the estimates of our operating results that we provide to the public, our failure to meet these projections or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;                   ·     press releases or other public announcements by us or others, including our filings with the SEC;                   ·     changes in the market perception of all-electric and hybrid products and services generally or in the effectiveness of our products and services in particular;                   ·     announcements of technological innovations, new applications, features, functionality or enhancements to products, services or products and services by us or by our competitors;                   ·     announcements of acquisitions, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;                   ·     announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases;                   ·     announcements regarding litigation involving us;                   ·     recruitment or departure of key personnel;                   ·     changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of debt or equity securities;                   ·     our entry into new markets;                   ·     regulatory developments in the United States or foreign countries;                   ·     the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry, and the industries of our customers;                   ·     the expiration of market standoff or contractual lock-up agreements;. 43. ·     the size of our market float; and                   ·     any other factors discussed in this report.. The market price and volume of our common stock could fluctuate, and in the past has fluctuated, relative to our limited public float. We are particularly subject to fluctuations—as reported on the Nasdaq Capital Market (Nasdaq) during the year ended December 31, 2017, our stock price reached highs of $18.31 and lows of $2.35, with daily trade volumes reaching a high of 2,694,000 and a low of 18,000. In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. We could in the future be the target of similar litigation. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. We will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could adversely affect our operating results.. As a newly public company, and particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company, we are incurring and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting and corporate governance requirements. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of Nasdaq and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will have to adapt to the requirements of being a public company and will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers.. The increased costs associated with operating as a public company will decrease our net income or increase our net loss, and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services. Additionally, if these requirements divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.. Nasdaq may delist our common stock from trading on its exchange, which could limit stockholders’ ability to trade our common stock.. As a listed company on Nasdaq, we are required to meet certain financial, public float, bid price and liquidity standards on an ongoing basis in order to continue the listing of our common stock. If we fail to meet these continued listing requirements, our common stock may be subject to delisting. If our common stock is delisted and we are not able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities would be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including limited availability of market quotations for our common stock and reduced liquidity for the trading of our securities. In addition, we could experience a decreased ability to issue additional securities and obtain additional financing in the future.. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.. 44. The trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if industry analysts cease coverage of us, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our common stock price and trading volume to decline.. We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which would cause our stock price to decline.. We may provide guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance, such as projections regarding sales and production, as well as anticipated future revenues, gross margins, profitability and cash flows. Correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate. Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes and average sales prices, supplier and commodity costs, and planned cost reductions. If our guidance is not accurate or varies from actual results due to our inability to meet our assumptions or the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties, the market value of our common stock could decline significantly.. A significant portion of our total outstanding shares are eligible to be sold into the market in the near future, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Other than the shares of common stock issued and sold in connection with our offerings of common stock in June 2017 and January 2018, substantially all of the remaining shares of common stock outstanding, based on shares outstanding as of March 7, 2018, will be restricted as a result of securities laws, lock-up agreements or other contractual restrictions that restrict transfers through June 15, 2018, subject to certain leak-out periods and exceptions.. We may release all or some portion of the shares subject to lock-up agreements prior to expiration of the lock-up period. Shares held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates will be subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act and various vesting agreements, after the aforementioned lock-up and leak-out periods.. Furthermore, our equity incentive plan allows us to issue stock options. We intend to register all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans so that such shares may be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates and the lock-up agreements executed in connection with our offering of common stock in June 2017. Moreover, we may in the future create additional equity incentive plans, which may at that time require us to file a registration statement under the Securities Act as soon as practicable after the expiration of the lock-up period to cover the issuance of shares upon the exercise or vesting of awards granted or otherwise purchased under those plans. As a result, any shares issued or granted under the plans after the lock-up period has expired also may be freely tradable in the public market. If equity securities are issued under the plans, if implemented, and it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market, then the price of our common stock could decline substantially.. No holders of any shares of our common stock have rights to require us to file registration statements for the public resale of such shares.. The concentration of our common stock ownership with our executive officers, directors and affiliates will limit your ability to influence corporate matters.. Our executive officers, directors and owners of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock and their respective affiliates beneficially owned, in the aggregate 39.9% of our outstanding common stock as of March 7, 2018. This percentage includes both outstanding shares of common stock and stock options that are vested and exercisable as of that date. These stockholders will therefore have significant influence over management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets, for the foreseeable future. This concentrated control will limit our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. This ownership could affect the value of our common stock.. 45. We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.. We have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.. Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:. ·     authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to defend against a takeover attempt;                   ·     establish a classified board of directors, as a result of which the successors to the directors whose terms have expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election;                   ·     require that directors only be removed from office for cause and only upon a supermajority stockholder vote;                   ·     provide that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office rather than by stockholders;                   ·     prevent stockholders from calling special meetings; and                   ·     prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders.. In addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder becomes an “interested” stockholder."
