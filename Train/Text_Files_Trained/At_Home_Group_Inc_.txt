[1] "ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS. The following risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. Our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below. Any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.. Risks Relating to Our Business. General economic factors may materially adversely affect our business, revenue and profitability.. General conditions in the United States and global economy that are beyond our control may materially adversely affect our business and financial performance. As a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending for home décor products, our customers may allocate less money for discretionary purchases as a result of increased levels of unemployment, reduced consumer disposable income, higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, foreclosures, bankruptcies, falling home prices, reduced availability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, a decline in consumer confidence, inflation, deflation, recession, an overall economic slowdown and other factors that influence consumer spending. Any reduced demand for the merchandise that we sell could result in a significant decline in customer traffic and sales and decreased inventory turnover. Therefore, if economic conditions worsen, there may be a material adverse impact on our business, revenue and profitability.. In addition, our costs and expenses could be materially adversely impacted by general economic factors such as higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, higher transportation costs, higher commodity costs, higher costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, increased rental expense, inflation in other costs, higher tax rates and other changes in the tax law and changes in other laws and regulations. The economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods, a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of merchandise we sell to our customers.. 11. Table of Contents. Volatility or disruption in the financial markets could materially adversely affect our business and the trading price of our common stock.. We rely on stable and efficient financial markets. Any disruption in the credit and capital markets could adversely impact our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. Volatility in the financial markets could also result in difficulties for financial institutions and other parties that we do business with, which could potentially affect our ability to access financing under our existing arrangements. We are exposed to the impact of any global or domestic economic disruption, including any potential impact of the withdrawal by the United Kingdom from the European Union, commonly referred to as \"Brexit\". Although we generally generate funds from our operations and our existing credit facilities to pay our operating expenses and fund our capital expenditures, our ability to continue to meet these cash requirements over the long term may require access to additional sources of funds, including equity and debt capital markets, and market volatility and general economic conditions may adversely affect our ability to access capital markets. In addition, the inability of our vendors to access capital and liquidity with which to maintain their inventory, production levels and product quality and to operate their businesses, or the insolvency of our vendors, could lead to their failure to deliver merchandise. If we are unable to purchase products when needed, our sales could be materially adversely impacted. Accordingly, volatility or disruption in the financial markets could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy and could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.. Consumer spending on home décor products could decrease or be displaced by spending on other activities as driven by a number of factors.. Consumer spending on home décor products could decrease or be displaced by spending on other activities as driven by a number of factors including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshifts in behavior away from home decorating in favor of other products or activities, such as fashion, media or electronics;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic conditions and other factors that affect consumer discretionary spending;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnatural disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, heavy snow, ice or rain storms, which disrupt the ability of consumers to continue spending on home décor products;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tman - made disasters, such as terrorism or war, as well as other national and international security concerns; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother matters that influence consumer confidence and spending.. Total consumer spending may not continue to increase at historical rates due to slowed population growth and shifts in population demographics, and it may not increase in certain product markets given changes in consumer interests. Further, as we expand into new markets, we may not accurately predict consumer preferences in that market, which could result in lower than expected sales. If consumer spending on home décor products decline, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.. We may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy on a timely basis or at all, which could harm our growth and results of operations.. Our growth is dependent on our ability to open profitable new stores. Our ability to increase the number of our stores will depend in part on the availability of existing big box retail stores or store sites that meet our specifications. We may face competition from other retailers for suitable locations and we may also face difficulties in negotiating leases on acceptable terms. In addition, a lack of available financing on terms acceptable to real estate developers or a tightening credit market may adversely affect the retail sites available to us. Rising real estate costs and acquisition, construction and development costs and available lease financing could also inhibit our ability to open or acquire new stores.. 12. Table of Contents. Opening or acquiring stores involves certain risks, including constructing, furnishing, supplying and staffing a store in a timely and cost - effective manner and accurately assessing the demographic or retail environment for a particular location, as well as addressing any environmental issues related to such locations. We cannot predict whether new stores will be successful. Our future sales at new stores may not meet our expectations, which could adversely impact our return on investment. For example, the costs of opening and operating new stores may offset the increased sales generated by the additional stores. Therefore, there can be no assurance that our new stores will generate sales levels necessary to achieve store - level profitability or profitability comparable to that of existing stores. New stores also may face greater competition and have lower anticipated sales volumes relative to previously opened stores during their comparable years of operation. In addition, a significant portion of our management's time and energy may be consumed with issues related to store expansion and we may be unable to hire a sufficient number of qualified store personnel or successfully integrate the new stores into our business. Furthermore, our vendors may be unable to meet the increased demand of additional stores in a timely manner. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain and distribute adequate merchandise to new stores or maintain adequate warehousing and distribution capability at acceptable costs.. In addition, our expansion in existing and new markets may present competitive, distribution, merchandising and regulatory challenges that differ from our current challenges, including competition among our stores, diminished novelty of our store design and concept, added strain on our existing distribution center, additional information to be processed by our information technology systems and diversion of management attention from operations. New stores in new markets, where we are less familiar with the population and are less well - known, may face different or additional risks and increased costs compared to stores operating in existing markets or new stores in existing markets. For example, we may need to increase marketing and advertising expenditures in new or smaller markets in which we have less store density. Additionally, we may not accurately predict consumer preferences in new markets, which could result in lower than expected sales. Expansion into new markets could also bring us into direct competition with retailers with whom we have no past experience as direct competitors. To the extent that we are not able to meet these new challenges, our sales could decrease and our operating costs could increase. Furthermore, our margins may be impacted in periods in which incremental expenses are incurred as a result of new store openings. Additionally, although our distribution center currently should be able to support a store base of up to approximately 220 stores, and we expect to open a second distribution center in fiscal year 2020, any unanticipated failure of or inability to support our growing store base could have a material adverse effect on our business. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in opening, acquiring or operating any new stores on a profitable basis.. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will achieve our planned growth or, even if we are able to grow our store base as planned, that any new stores will perform as planned. If we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy, we will not be able to sustain the growth in sales and profits that we expect, which would likely have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.. Failure to manage our inventory effectively and inability to satisfy changing consumer demands and preferences could materially adversely impact our operations.. Due to the nature of our business, we make decisions regarding merchandise several months in advance of each of the seasons in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly with respect to our merchandise that is manufactured, purchased and imported from countries around the world. We must maintain sufficient inventory levels to operate our business successfully. However, if we misjudge consumer preferences or demands, we could have excess inventory that may need to be held for a long period of time, written down or discarded in order to clear excess inventory, especially seasonal and holiday merchandise. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand, we may not be able to provide certain products in a timely manner to our customers in order to meet their demand, which can result in lost sales. Either event could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we recently upgraded to a new inventory planning and allocation system. If the new inventory planning and allocation system is unsuccessful, our ability to properly allocate inventory to stores could be adversely affected.. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to offer assortments of products that appeal to our customers or that we will satisfy changing consumer demands and preferences in the future. Accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe miscalculate either the market for the merchandise in our stores or our customers' purchasing habits;. 13. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconsumer demand unexpectedly shifts away from the merchandise we offer or if there are unanticipated shifts in consumer preferences in some seasons; or. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe are unable to anticipate, identify and respond to changing consumer demands or emerging trends, including shifts in the popularity of certain products or increased consumer demand for more enhanced customer service and assistance, home delivery or online sales and services.. In addition, inventory shrinkage (inventory theft, loss or damage) rates could negatively impact our financial results. Furthermore, failure to control merchandise returns could also adversely affect our business. We have established a provision for estimated merchandise returns based upon historical experience and other known factors. However, if actual returns are greater than those projected by management, additional reductions of revenue could be recorded in the future. In addition, to the extent that returned merchandise is damaged or otherwise not appealing to our customers, we may not receive full retail value from the resale or liquidation of the returned merchandise.. Our business model currently relies on purchasing all inventory centrally through our home office in Plano, Texas. At this office, all product samples are developed and/or received and reviewed; in addition, all purchase orders are placed, fulfilled and allocated from the same location. Major catastrophic events such as natural disasters, localized labor issues or wages increases, fire or flooding, malfunction or disruption of the information systems, a disruption in communication services, power outages or shipping interruptions could delay or otherwise adversely affect inventory purchasing or allocation, as well as the ultimate distribution of inventory to our stores and customers. Such disruptions could have a negative impact on our sales and results of operations. Our business model of central purchasing could also fail to account for differences in consumer preferences by market. In such cases, and where our focus of providing the broadest assortment of products for any room similarly did not account for differences in consumer preferences by market, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected.. The loss of, or disruption in, or our inability to efficiently operate our distribution network could have a materially adverse impact on our business.. We operate a single cross - dock distribution center in Plano, Texas, which services all of our stores, as well as warehouse premises in Garland, Texas. The majority of our inventory is shipped directly from suppliers to our distribution center where the inventory is processed and then shipped to our stores. Only mattresses and some food items are shipped directly to stores. We rely in large part on the orderly operation of this receiving and distribution process, which depends on our automated distribution system, adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of our distribution network. If complications arise with our distribution facility or if the facility or warehouse premises (or a significant portion of inventory located there) is severely damaged or destroyed, our ability to receive and deliver inventory on a timely basis will be significantly impaired. There can be no assurance that disruptions in operations due to natural or man - made disasters, fire, flooding, terrorism or other catastrophic events, system failure, labor disagreements or shipping problems will not result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores. Such delays could materially adversely impact our business. In addition, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing merchandise to our stores during the time it takes for us to reopen or replace our distribution center. Moreover, our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to cover or compensate us for any losses that may occur. In addition, our distribution center should have the capacity to support up to approximately 220 stores. In anticipation of our growth to more than 220 stores, we plan to open a second distribution center in fiscal year 2020; however, there can be no assurance that the new distribution center will be opened on our expected timeline, that there will not be any delay in opening, constructing, engineering or fully utilizing the new distribution center or that there will not be any delays or issues in shipping schedules, logistics or systems if and when the new distribution center is opened.. We rely upon various means of transportation through third parties, including shipments by air, sea, rail and truck, to deliver products to our distribution center from vendors and from our distribution center to our stores, as well as for direct shipments from vendors to stores. Labor shortages or capacity constraints in the transportation industry, disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure, fuel shortages or transportation cost increases (such as increases in fuel costs or port fees) could materially adversely affect our business and operating results, particularly as we receive and deliver our seasonal and holiday merchandise.. 14. Table of Contents. We are subject to a number of risks because we import a significant portion of our merchandise.. Approximately 60% of our merchandise was purchased from vendors in foreign countries such as China, Hong Kong, Belgium, Taiwan, India and Vietnam during fiscal year 2018. In addition, many of our domestic vendors purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources. For example, we purchase merchandise from domestic vendors that is imported from China or that is manufactured in China and assembled in the United States. Currently, we do not employ any resources on the ground in Asia to manage our procurement process and various vendor relationships. Instead, we often rely on trading companies to handle sourcing and logistics with Asian factories.. Foreign sourcing subjects us to a number of risks generally associated with doing business abroad such as the following:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlong lead times;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twork stoppages and strikes;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelays in shipment, shipping port and ocean carrier constraints;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfreight cost increases;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct quality issues;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\traw material shortages and factory consolidations;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\temployee rights issues and other social concerns;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tepidemics and natural disasters;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical instability, international conflicts, war, threats of war, terrorist acts or threats, especially threats to foreign and U.S. ports and piracy;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teconomic conditions, including inflation;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe imposition of tariffs, duties, quotas, taxes, import and export controls and other trade restrictions;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgovernmental policies and regulations; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe status of trade relations with foreign countries, including the loss of \"most favored nation\" status with the United States for a particular foreign country.. Adverse events could have a greater impact on us than if our operations were in more dispersed geographical regions.. We currently operate 151 stores in 34 states, primarily in the South Central, Southeastern and Midwestern regions of the United States, including 30 stores in Texas. In addition, we operate a single distribution center and warehouse premises in Texas, which service all of our stores. Accordingly, the effect on us of adverse events in these regions, especially in Texas, such as weather (including hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, heavy snow, ice or rain storms), natural or man - made disasters, catastrophic events, terrorism, blackouts, widespread illness or unfavorable regional economic conditions, may be greater than if our operations or inventory were more geographically dispersed throughout the country or abroad. Such events could result in physical damage to or destruction or disruption of one or more of our properties, physical damage to or destruction of our inventory, the closure of one or more stores, the lack of an adequate workforce in parts or all of our operations, supply chain disruptions, data and communications disruptions and the inability of our customers to shop in our stores.. 15. Table of Contents. In addition, increases in our selling, general and administrative expenses due to overhead costs could affect our profitability more negatively than if we had a larger store base. One or more unsuccessful new stores, or a decline in sales or profitability at an existing store, will have a more significant effect on our results of operations than if we had a larger store base.. Because of our international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti - bribery and anti - kickback laws.. We source over half of our products abroad. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non - U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti - bribery laws, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in preventing our employees or other agents from taking actions in violation of these laws or regulations. Such violations, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. We are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space.. We lease certain of our retail properties, our distribution center and our corporate office. The profitability of our business is dependent on operating our current store base with favorable margins, opening and operating new stores at a reasonable profit, renewing leases for stores in desirable locations and, if necessary, identifying and closing underperforming stores. We lease a significant number of our store locations, ranging from short - term to long - term leases. Typically, a large portion of a store's operating expense is the cost associated with leasing the location.. The operating leases for our retail properties, distribution center and corporate office expire at various dates through 2037. A number of the leases have renewal options for various periods of time at our discretion. We are typically responsible for taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance for these retail properties. Rent expense for the fiscal years ended January 27, 2018, January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016 totaled approximately $83.4 million, $68.1 million and $52.3 million, respectively. Our future minimum rental commitments for all operating leases in existence as of January 27, 2018 for fiscal year 2019 is approximately $85.2 million and total approximately $1,081.6 million for fiscal years 2020 through 2037. We expect that many of the new stores we open will also be leased to us under operating leases, which will further increase our operating lease expenditures and require significant capital expenditures. We depend on cash flows from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under our asset-based revolving line of credit (the \"ABL Facility\"), as described in Note 5  -  Revolving Line of Credit, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules,\" or other sources, we may not be able to service our lease expenses or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would materially affect our business.. Over time current store locations may not continue to be desirable because of changes in demographics within the surrounding area or a decline in shopping traffic, including traffic generated by other nearby stores. Although we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions by making certain payments (typically within two to three years after opening a store), we may not be able to terminate a particular lease if or when we would like to do so. If we decide to close stores, we are generally required to either continue to pay rent and operating expenses for the balance of the lease term or, for certain locations, pay exercise rights to terminate, which in either case could be expensive. Even if we are able to assign or sublease vacated locations where our lease cannot be terminated, we may remain liable on the lease obligations if the assignee or sublessee does not perform.. In addition, when leases for the stores in our ongoing operations expire, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, which could cause us to close stores in locations that may be desirable. We may be unable to relocate these stores cost - effectively or at all and there can be no assurance that any relocated stores will be successful.. 16. Table of Contents. We are subject to risks associated with our sale - leaseback strategy.. From time to time, we engage in sale - leaseback transactions. The net proceeds from such transactions have been used to reduce outstanding debt and fund future capital expenditures for new store development. However, the sale - leaseback market may cease to be a reliable source of additional cash flows for us in the future if capitalization rates become less attractive, other unfavorable market conditions develop or the perceived value of our owned property declines. For example, should the sale - leaseback market require significantly higher yields (which may occur as interest rates rise), we may not enter into sale - leaseback transactions, which could adversely affect our ability to reduce outstanding debt and fund capital expenditures for future store development.. We operate in a highly competitive retail environment.. The retail business is highly competitive. The marketplace for home décor products is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by using a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies, dedicating a portion of their selling space to a limited selection of home décor, seasonal and holiday merchandise. Although we are the only big box concept solely dedicated to the home décor space, for all of our major products we compete with a diverse group of retailers, including mass merchants (such as Target and Wal - Mart), home improvement stores (such as Home Depot and Lowe's), craft retailers (such as Hobby Lobby, Jo - Ann Stores and Michaels Stores), home specialty/décor retailers (such as Bed Bath & Beyond, The Container Store, Home Goods and Pier 1 Imports), as well as various other small, independent retailers. In addition, to a lesser extent, we compete with Internet - based retailers (such as Wayfair), which competition could intensify in the future.. We compete with these and other retailers for customers, retail locations, management and other personnel. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources, more customers and greater store brand recognition. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology, distribution and marketing. Competitive pressures or other factors could cause us to lose customers, sales and market share, which may require us to lower prices, increase marketing and advertising expenditures or increase the use of discounting or promotional campaigns, each of which could materially adversely affect our margins and could result in a decrease in our operating results and profitability. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors. Further, although we do not currently engage in e - commerce, there is no assurance that we will not in the future, and the use of e - commerce by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business. Expansion into markets served by our competitors, entry of new competitors, expansion of existing competitors into our markets or the adoption by competitors of innovative store formats and retail sale methods, including e - commerce, could cause us to lose market share and could be detrimental to our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We face risks related to our substantial indebtedness.. As of January 27, 2018, we had total borrowings of $461.5 million outstanding under our ABL Facility and our Term Loan (as defined below). Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our ABL Facility and $300 million senior secured term loan (the \"Term Loan\"). Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, and any failure to comply with the obligations under our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing our indebtedness increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, selling and marketing efforts, product development, future business opportunities and other purposes;. 17. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as substantially all of our borrowings are at variable rates;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestricting us from making strategic acquisitions;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimiting our ability to plan for, or adjust to, changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be less highly leveraged.. The occurrence of any one of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in the credit agreements governing our ABL Facility and Term Loan.. The ABL Facility and Term Loan impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries that may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict our ability to operate our business.. The credit agreements governing our ABL Facility and Term Loan contain covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries' ability to take various actions, such as:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain disqualified or preferred stock;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpay dividends or make other distributions on, or redeem or purchase, any equity interests or make other restricted payments;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake certain acquisitions or investments;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcreate or incur liens;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttransfer or sell assets;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur restrictions on the payments of dividends or other distributions from our restricted subsidiaries;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\talter the business that we conduct;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into transactions with affiliates; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconsummate a merger or consolidation or sell, assign, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.. The restrictions in the credit agreements governing our ABL Facility and Term Loan also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions or to engage in other business activities that could be in our interest.. In addition, our ability to borrow under the ABL Facility is limited by the amount of our borrowing base. Any negative impact on the elements of our borrowing base, such as accounts receivable and inventory, could reduce our borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility.. 18. Table of Contents. We are dependent upon the services of our senior management and our buyers.. We are dependent on the services, abilities and experiences of our senior management team. Any loss or interruption of the services of our senior management, or any general instability in the composition of our senior management team, could significantly reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations. Lee Bird, our Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board and President, joined us in December 2012 and, together with our senior management team, has played an instrumental role in developing and executing our business and operating strategies, which we believe are critical to our ability to maintain strong margins. Therefore, the loss of Mr. Bird's services, or any members of our senior management, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and profitability and there can be no assurance that we will be able to find appropriate replacements for our senior management as needed. In addition, certain members of our management team are relatively new to our business and have not worked as a team with other members of management for a significant period of time. Therefore, there can be no assurance that any new members of our management team will be able to successfully execute our business and operating strategies or continue to follow the same strategies.. In addition, a number of our buyers have been with us for many years and have developed a deep understanding of our business and our customers. The market for buyers is highly competitive and it may be difficult to find suitable replacements if we lose any of our buyers. If we are unable to find suitable replacements, we may experience difficulties in selecting and sourcing merchandise, which could materially adversely impact our business, revenue and profitability.. Failure to attract and retain quality employees could materially adversely affect our performance.. Our performance depends on attracting and retaining quality people at all levels, including corporate, stores, the distribution center and other areas. Many of our store employees are in entry level or part - time positions with historically high rates of turnover. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and governmental labor and employment requirements. In the event of changes in the federal or state minimum wage, living wage requirements or changes in other wage or workplace regulations, including, for example, health care or employee leave regulations, if our overall compensation and benefits fail to remain competitive, then the quality of our workforce could decline, while increasing our costs could impair our profitability. If we do not continue to attract and retain quality employees, our performance could be materially adversely affected.. Although none of our employees are currently covered under collective bargaining agreements, there can be no assurance that our employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future. If some or all of our workforce were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements or work practices, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Difficulties with our vendors may adversely impact our business.. Our performance depends on our ability to purchase merchandise at sufficient levels and at competitive prices from vendors who can deliver products in a timely and efficient manner and in compliance with our vendor standards and all applicable laws and regulations. We currently have over 500 vendor relationships. Generally, we do not have any long - term purchase agreements or other contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products, and any vendor could discontinue selling to us at any time. Historically, we have not relied on any single vendor for our products and have not had difficulties replacing vendors for various products we sell. However, in the future there is no assurance that we will continue to be able to acquire desired merchandise in sufficient quantities or on terms acceptable to us, or be able to develop relationships with new vendors to replace any discontinued vendors. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise in the future or our failure to replace any one or more vendors may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, any significant change in the payment terms that we have with our suppliers could adversely affect our liquidity.. Many of our suppliers are small firms that produce a limited number of items. These smaller vendors generally have limited resources, production capacities and operating histories, and some of our vendors have limited the distribution of their merchandise in the past. Accordingly, these vendors may be susceptible to cash flow issues, downturns in economic conditions, production difficulties, quality control issues and difficulty delivering agreed - upon. 19. Table of Contents. quantities on schedule and in compliance with regulatory requirements. If a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons, we could experience merchandise out - of - stocks that could lead to lost sales, especially with respect to seasonal and holiday merchandise. In addition, there is no assurance that we would be able, if necessary, to return product to these vendors, obtain refunds of our purchase price or obtain reimbursement or indemnification from any of our vendors should we so desire, and from time to time, we may be in litigation with one or more vendors. Many of these suppliers require extensive advance notice of our requirements in order to supply products in the quantities we need. This long lead time requires us to place orders far in advance of the time when certain products will be offered for sale, exposing us to shifts in consumer demand and discretionary spending.. Our business is moderately seasonal and weak performance during one of our historically strong seasonal periods could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the entire fiscal year.. Our business is moderately seasonal, with a meaningful portion of our sales dedicated to seasonal and holiday merchandise, resulting in the realization of higher portions of net sales and operating income in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Due to the importance of our peak sales periods, which include the spring and year - end holiday decorating seasons, the second and fourth fiscal quarters have historically contributed, and are expected to continue to contribute, significantly to our operating results for the entire fiscal year. In anticipation of seasonal increases in sales activity during these periods, we incur significant additional expense prior to and during our peak seasonal periods, which we may finance with additional short - term borrowings. These expenses may include the acquisition of additional inventory, seasonal staffing needs and other similar items. As a result, any factors negatively affecting us during these periods, including adverse weather and unfavorable economic conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year.. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate substantially and historical quarterly operating results may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance.. Our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many outside of our control, including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic and political conditions;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe mix of merchandise sold;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshifts in consumer tastes and changes in demand for the products that we offer in our stores;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcalendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing of new store openings and the level of pre - opening expenses associated with new stores;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe amount and timing of sales contributed by new stores;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstore closings or relocations and costs related thereto;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpansion of existing or entry of new competitors into our markets;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpricing and other actions taken by our competitors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in promotions, advertising or other actions taken by us or our existing or possible new competitors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing and level of markdowns;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelays in the flow of merchandise to our stores;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in our operating expenses;. 20. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in commodity prices and the cost of fuel;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforeign exchange rates;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlitigation;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse weather conditions in our markets, particularly on weekends;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnatural or man - made disasters;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing of income tax refunds to our customers;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing or elimination of certain state and local tax holidays; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in other tenants or landlords or surrounding geographic circumstances in the areas in which we are located.. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results for the fiscal quarter in which such event occurs as well as for the entire fiscal year. Therefore, period - to - period comparisons of historical quarterly operating results may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance.. We may not be able to protect our important intellectual property and we could incur substantial costs if we are subject to claims that our operations infringe on the proprietary rights of others.. We rely on our proprietary intellectual property, including trademarks, to market, promote and sell our products in our stores, particularly our At Home private label products. We monitor and protect against activities that might infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademarks and other intellectual property and rely on the trademark and other laws of the United States. However, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization. To the extent we cannot protect our intellectual property, unauthorized use and misuse of our intellectual property could harm our competitive position and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.. Additionally, we cannot be certain that we do not or will not in the future infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. From time to time, we have been subject to claims from third parties that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights and we face the risk of such claims in the future. Any intellectual property infringement claims against us could be costly, time - consuming, harmful to our reputation or result in injunctive or other equitable relief that may require us to make changes to our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.. Increases in commodity prices and supply chain costs could materially adversely affect our results of operations.. Various commodities are used in our merchandise, such as petroleum, resin, copper, steel, cotton and lumber. These commodities are subject to inflation, price fluctuations and other market disturbances, including supply shortages. Increases in commodity prices or the costs related to our supply chain and distribution network, including currency exchange rates, tariffs, labor, fuel and other transportation costs, could have a material adverse effect on our gross margin, expenses and results of operations. Due to the uncertainty of these price fluctuations and our strategy to maintain everyday low prices, we may not be able to pass some or all of these increased costs on to our customers. Even if we are able to pass these increased costs on to our customers, we may not be able to do so on a timely basis, our gross margins could decline and we may not be able to implement other price increases for our merchandise.. 21. Table of Contents. If we are required to make significant investments in advertising, marketing or promotions, our margins and profitability could materially decline.. In general, we employ an everyday low pricing strategy that avoids high - low pricing and promotions and allows us to minimize advertising and marketing expenses incurred by other retailers. However, there is no assurance that we can continue to be successful without significant advertising, marketing and promotions, particularly as we open stores in new markets. We spent over $20 million in capital and expenses in connection with our rebranding initiative during fiscal year 2015 and may need to incur additional expenses to promote our new brand. In addition, there is no assurance that any further investments we have made or may make in the future with respect to advertising, marketing or promotions will be successful or result in a positive return on investment. Therefore, if we are required to make significant investments in advertising, marketing or promotions and related expenditures, our margins and profitability could materially decline even if sales increase.. Any online services or e - commerce activities that we may launch in the future may require substantial investment and may not be successful.. We do not currently engage in e - commerce and have a limited online presence through our website and other forms of social media. Over fiscal years 2017 and 2018, we upgraded our website to enable our customers to view our product assortment online with robust search functionality and a mobile-friendly website, but we do not currently sell merchandise through our website. However, as part of our growth strategy, we are exploring expansion of our online services and could engage in e - commerce activities in the future, which would require substantial investment. The success of any online services or e - commerce business would depend, in part, on factors over which we may not control. We would need to successfully respond to changing consumer preferences and buying trends relating to online or e - commerce usage. We would also be vulnerable to increased risks and uncertainties including: changes in required technology interfaces; website downtime and other technical failures; costs and technical issues related to upgrading website software; computer viruses; changes in applicable federal and state regulations; security breaches; consumer privacy concerns; and keeping up to date with competitive technology trends, including the use of new or improved technology, creative user interfaces and other online or e - commerce marketing tools. In addition, any e - commerce platform may be unprofitable, cannibalize sales from our existing stores or not be able to compete successfully against other Internet - based retailers who sell similar merchandise. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect sales in any e - commerce business that we establish in the future and could damage our reputation and brand. Further, in the event that we engage in e - commerce in the future, we will need to establish a shipping and delivery system for items purchased online, for which we do not currently have adequate capability. Our business could be adversely affected if we are not able to successfully develop and integrate such a shipping and delivery system in connection with any e - commerce business in which we may engage in the future.. Disruptions to our information systems, or our failure to adequately support, maintain and upgrade these systems, could negatively impact our operations and financial results.. We depend on our information technology systems for many aspects of our business. We have made significant investments in information technology, including investments in systems and applications for finance and accounting functions, supply chain management software for retail operations and data warehouse management systems and an automated distribution system for our distribution center operations. We purchase our inventory through a centralized inventory management system that operates for the entire chain. Merchandise is bar - coded, enabling management to control inventory and pricing by SKU. Sales are updated daily in the merchandise reporting systems by polling all sales information from each store's point - of sale terminals. Stores are then staffed based on a statistically developed labor model which incorporates the daily and hourly store sales volume. We attempt to mitigate the risk of possible business interruptions caused by disruptions to our information systems by maintaining a disaster recovery plan, which includes maintaining backup systems off - site. However, despite safeguards and careful contingency planning, our systems are still subject to power outages, computer viruses, computer and telecommunication failures, employee usage errors, security breaches, terrorism, natural or man - made disasters and other catastrophic events. A major disruption of our information systems and backup mechanisms may cause us to incur significant costs to repair our systems and experience a critical loss of data. System failures could also disrupt our ability to track, record and analyze sales and inventory and could cause disruptions of our operations, including, among other things, our ability to process and ship inventory, process financial information including credit card transactions, process payrolls or vendor payments or engage in other similar normal business activities.. 22. Table of Contents. In addition, we may be unable to improve, upgrade, integrate or expand upon our existing systems and any costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations.. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information could harm our business and standing with our customers.. The protection of our customer, employee and other company data is critical to us. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential customer information, such as payment card and personal information. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, payment card terminal tampering, computer viruses, ransomware, misplaced, lost or stolen data, programming or human errors or other similar events. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access to data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage our facilities and systems are constantly changing and evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. The ever-evolving threats mean we must continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes, and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data. We and our third-party service providers may not anticipate or prevent all types of attacks until after they have already been launched, and techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers. In addition, security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. The risks associated with our processing of sensitive customer data may be heightened if the amount of such data collected is increased, including via the co-branded and private label credit card and customer loyalty programs that we launched during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, whether by us or our third-party service providers, could damage our reputation, expose us to risk of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and harm our business. In addition, as a result of recent security breaches at a number of prominent retailers, the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense. As a result, we may incur significant costs to change our business practices or modify our service offerings in connection with the protection of personally identifiable information.. Regulatory or litigation developments could materially adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.. We are subject to numerous statutory, regulatory and legal requirements at a local, state, national and international level because of our business operations, store locations, workforce, sales to consumers and importation of merchandise. In addition, as a publicly traded company we may be exposed to the risk of stockholder litigation if our stock price declines. Laws and regulations affecting our business may change, sometimes frequently and significantly, as a result of political, economic, social or other events. Changes in the regulatory environment in the areas of product safety, environmental protection, privacy and information security, health care, labor and employment, U.S. customs, advertising and taxes, among others, could potentially impact our operations and financial results. For example, more stringent and varied requirements of local and state governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new stores in particular locations. Environmental laws and regulations also govern, among other things, discharges of pollutants into the air and water as well as the presence, handling, release and disposal of and exposure to hazardous substances. These laws provide for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance. Third parties may also make personal injury, property damage or other claims against us associated with actual or alleged release of, or exposure to, hazardous substances at our properties. We could also be strictly liable, without regard to fault, for certain environmental conditions at properties we formerly owned or operated as well as at our current properties. We could be negatively impacted by developments in these areas due to the costs of compliance, and if we fail to comply with a law or regulation, we may be subject to claims, lawsuits, fines, penalties, loss of a license or permit and adverse publicity or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. 23. Table of Contents. Product recalls and/or product liability, as well as changes in product safety and other consumer protection laws, may adversely impact our operations, merchandise offerings, reputation, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.. We are subject to regulations by a variety of federal, state and international regulatory authorities, including The Consumer Product Safety Commission. A large portion of our merchandise is manufactured in foreign countries. As such, one or more of our vendors might not adhere to product safety requirements or our quality control standards, and we might not identify the deficiency before merchandise ships to our stores. If our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. We could be required to recall some of those products or could expose ourselves to government enforcement action or private litigation, such as product liability claims, which could result in significant fines, penalties, monetary damages and other remedies as well as harm to our reputation. We could also be subject to litigation related to injuries or other accidents at our stores or distribution center.. Moreover, changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs to us for certain merchandise, or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale. Long lead times on merchandise ordering cycles increase the difficulty for us to plan and prepare for potential changes to applicable laws. In particular, The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 imposes significant requirements on manufacturing, importing, testing and labeling requirements for some of our products. In the event that we are unable to timely comply with regulatory changes, significant fines or penalties could result, and could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.. Inadequacy of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business.. We maintain third-party insurance coverage against various liability risks and risks of property loss and business interruption, as well directors and officers' liability insurance coverage. While we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against liability and property damage risks, the potential liabilities associated with those risks or other events could exceed the coverage provided by such arrangements. Significant uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our Company.. Our continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of At Home.. We are highly dependent on our reputation amongst home décor enthusiasts. To remain successful in the future, we must continue to preserve, grow and utilize the value of our reputation as the destination retailer for our customers' home décor needs. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities, and even isolated incidents may erode trust and confidence. Events that can damage our reputation include, but are not limited to, legal violations, litigation, actual or perceived ethical problems, product safety issues, actual or perceived poor employee relations, actual or perceived poor customer service, store appearance or operational issues, unauthorized use or other misappropriation of our trade name, data security, terrorism or other events outside of our control that could generate negative publicity with respect to At Home, whether in traditional media or social media outlets. Any event that has the potential to negatively impact our trade name or our reputation with customers, employees, suppliers, communities, governmental officials and others could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. Our operating results and financial position could be negatively impacted by accounting policies, rules and regulations.. Our operating results and financial position could be negatively impacted by implementation of our various accounting policies as well as changes to accounting rules and regulations or new interpretations of existing accounting standards. These changes may include, without limitation, changes to lease accounting standards. For example, while we are still evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU No. 2016 - 02, \"Leases\" on our consolidated financial statements, we expect that upon adoption we will recognize right-of-use assets and liabilities that will be material to our financial statements. In addition, from time to time, we could incur impairment charges that adversely affect our operating results. For example, changes in economic or operating conditions impacting our estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of intangible assets (such as our goodwill or trade name) or long - lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. In the event that we determine our intangible or long - lived assets are. 24. Table of Contents. impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.. Recently enacted changes to the U.S. tax laws may have a material impact on our business. Other changes in our effective income tax rate could also affect us.. Our effective income tax rate is influenced by a number of factors. Changes in the tax laws, the interpretation of existing laws or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate. Further, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations.. On December 20, 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate each voted to approve H.R. 1 (commonly referred to as the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\") and, on December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act makes extensive changes to the U.S. tax laws and includes provisions that, among other things, reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate, limit certain deductions for executive compensation, introduce a capital investment deduction, and place certain limitations on the interest deduction. As a result of the reduction in the corporate tax rate, we were required to revalue our U.S. net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017. Our initial estimate of the impact of the revaluation resulted in a non-cash charge recorded in income tax expense of approximately $16.7 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is complex and far-reaching and we cannot predict with certainty the resulting impact its enactment will have on us. As we continue to evaluate the application of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to record further charges to income in future periods.. We are a holding company with no operations of our own, and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash.. We are a holding company and do not have any material assets or operations other than ownership of equity interests of our subsidiaries. Our operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries, and our ability to generate cash to meet our obligations or to pay dividends, if any, is highly dependent on the earnings of, and receipt of funds from, our subsidiaries through dividends or intercompany loans. The ability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to allow us and them to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on their future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control. We cannot assure our stockholders that the cash flow and earnings of our operating subsidiaries will be adequate for our subsidiaries to service their debt obligations. If our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy corporate obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans (such as refinancing), restructure debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. We cannot assure our stockholders that any such alternative refinancing would be possible, that any assets could be sold, or, if sold, of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales, that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all, or that additional financing would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our obligations, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Furthermore, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future that may severely restrict or prohibit our subsidiaries from making distributions, paying dividends, if any, or making loans to us.. Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock. The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, and our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the price they paid for them.. The trading price of our common stock could be volatile, and our stockholders can lose all or part of their investment. The following factors, in addition to other factors described in this \"Risk Factors\" section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tquarterly variations in our operating results compared to market expectations;. 25. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the preferences of our customers;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlow comparable store sales growth compared to market expectations;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelays in the planned openings of new stores;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe failure of securities analysts to cover the Company or changes in analysts' financial estimates;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teconomic, legal, regulatory and political factors unrelated to our performance;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in consumer spending or the housing market;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased competition or stock price performance of our competitors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfuture sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in senior management or key personnel;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinvestor perceptions of us and the retail industry;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnew regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\taction by institutional stockholders or other large stockholders;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure to meet any guidance given by us or any change in any guidance given by us, or changes by us in our guidance practices;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tspeculation in the press or investment community;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tevents beyond our control, such as war, terrorist attacks, transportation and fuel prices, natural disasters, severe weather and widespread illness; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe other factors listed in this \"Risk Factors\" section.. In addition, our stock price may be volatile. The stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies like us. Accordingly, these broad market and industry factors may significantly reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.. Because the Sponsors control a significant percentage of our common stock, they may control all major corporate decisions and their interests may conflict with your interests as an owner of our common stock and those of the Company.. We are controlled by the Sponsors, which currently own approximately 73% of our common stock. Accordingly, the Sponsors currently control the election of the majority of our directors and could exercise a controlling interest over our business, affairs and policies, including the appointment of our management and the entering into of business combinations or dispositions and other corporate transactions. The directors so elected have the authority to incur additional debt, issue or repurchase stock, declare dividends and make other decisions that could be detrimental to stockholders. In addition, pursuant to the stockholders' agreement, for a period of two years following our initial public offering, subject to certain exceptions, Starr Investments has agreed to vote or cause to be voted 8,519,176 of their shares of our common stock on all matters presented to stockholders in the same manner that AEA votes on such matters. In. 26. Table of Contents. addition, for so long as certain affiliates of AEA, on the one hand, and Starr Investments, on the other hand, respectively in the aggregate hold at least 10% of our outstanding common stock, each of such Sponsors shall be entitled to nominate at least one individual for election to our board, and our board and nominating committee thereof shall nominate and recommend to our stockholders that such individual be elected to our board, and each party to the stockholders' agreement agrees to vote all of their shares to elect such individual to our board.. The Sponsors may have interests that are different from our other stockholders and may vote in a way with which our other stockholders disagree and which may be adverse to our other stockholders' interests. Further, AEA and Starr Investments may have differing views from each other, neither of which may align with other stockholders' interests. In addition, the Sponsors' concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or prevent stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their common stock.. Additionally, the Sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us or supply us with goods and services. The Sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Stockholders should consider that the interests of the Sponsors may differ from their interests in material respects.. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall.. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.. Moreover, the approximately 73% of our outstanding common stock held by our Sponsors has been registered for resale on Form S-3. On December 11, 2017, we completed a secondary offering in which such holders sold an aggregate of 5,750,000 shares of our common stock.  Pursuant to the registration rights agreement to which we and such holders are parties, these holders have the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to facilitate future offerings of their shares, which would result in their shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, unless purchased by affiliates (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act). Sales of stock by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.. As of March 19, 2018, we had 61,629,576 shares of common stock outstanding. Of these shares, all but the 44,832,545 shares of our common stock held by our Sponsors, as well as the shares held by our executive officers and directors, are freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act.. On April 5, 2017, we filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register the shares of common stock to be issued under our equity compensation plans and, as a result, all shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of stock options granted under our plans are also freely tradable under the Securities Act, unless held by our affiliates. As of January 27, 2018, there were stock options outstanding to purchase a total of 7,040,894 shares of our common stock and 200,660 shares of our common stock subject to restricted stock units. In addition, as of January 27, 2018, 3,547,096 shares of our common stock were reserved for future issuance under our Equity Incentive Plan.. If securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about At Home, or if they issue unfavorable commentary about us or our industry or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.. The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that third - party securities analysts publish about At Home and the retail industry. One or more analysts could downgrade our common stock or issue other negative commentary about At Home or our industry. In addition, if one or more of these analysts cease. 27. Table of Contents. coverage of At Home, we could lose visibility in the market. As a result of one or more of these factors, the trading price of our common stock could decline.. Some provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti - takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.. Provisions in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions include:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablishing a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tallowing the total number of directors to be determined exclusively (subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock to elect additional directors) by resolution of our board of directors and granting to our board the sole power (subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock or rights granted pursuant to the stockholders' agreement) to fill any vacancy on the board;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimiting the ability of stockholders to remove directors without cause if AEA ceases to own, or have the right to direct the vote of, 50% or more of the voting power of our common stock;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tauthorizing the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock by our board of directors, without further stockholder approval, to thwart a takeover attempt;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprohibiting stockholder action by written consent (and, thus, requiring that all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders), if AEA ceases to own, or have the right to direct the vote of, 50% or more of the voting power of our common stock;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders, except for AEA, so long as AEA owns, or has the right to direct the vote of, 50% or more of the voting power of our common stock;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at annual stockholder meetings; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequiring the approval of the holders of at least two - thirds of the voting power of all outstanding stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, to amend or repeal our certificate of incorporation or bylaws if AEA ceases to own, or have the right to direct the vote of, 50% or more of the voting power of our common stock.. In addition, while we have opted out of Section 203 of the DGCL, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains similar provisions providing that we may not engage in certain \"business combinations\" with any \"interested stockholder\" for a three - year period following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprior to such time, our board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tupon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding certain shares; or. 28. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tat or subsequent to that time, the business combination is approved by our board of directors and by the affirmative vote of holders of at least two - thirds of our outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.. Generally, a \"business combination\" includes a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction provided for or through our Company resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, an \"interested stockholder\" is a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock and the affiliates and associates of such person. For purposes of this provision, \"voting stock\" means any class or series of stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that AEA, Starr Investments, their respective affiliates and any of their respective direct or indirect designated transferees (other than in certain market transfers and gifts) and any group of which such persons are a party do not constitute \"interested stockholders\" for purposes of this provision.. Under certain circumstances, this provision will make it more difficult for a person who qualifies as an \"interested stockholder\" to effect certain business combinations with our Company for a three - year period. This provision may encourage companies interested in acquiring us to negotiate in advance with our board of directors in order to avoid the stockholder approval requirement if our board of directors approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder. These provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in our board of directors and may make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that our stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interests.. These anti - takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our Company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take corporate actions other than those that our stockholders desire.. We are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act.. We are required to comply for the first time with the management certification requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We currently perform the system and process evaluation and testing (and any necessary remediation) required to comply with the management certification and, once required, will complete the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act.  We are in the process of evaluating our internal controls systems to allow our independent auditors to audit our internal controls over financial reporting.. When we are no longer an emerging growth company, our management report on internal control over financial reporting will need to be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm. We do not expect to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to our management report on internal control over financial reporting while we are an emerging growth company. Furthermore, upon completion of this process, we may identify control deficiencies of varying degrees of severity under applicable SEC and PCAOB rules and regulations that remain unremediated. As a public company, we are required to report, among other things, control deficiencies that constitute a \"material weakness\" or changes in internal controls that, or that are reasonably likely to, materially affect internal controls over financial reporting. A \"material weakness\" is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A \"significant deficiency\" is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of our financial reporting.. To continue to comply with the requirements of being a public company, we have undertaken various actions, and may need to take additional actions, such as implementing and enhancing our internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. Testing and maintaining internal controls can divert our management's attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. Additionally, when evaluating our internal control over financial reporting, we may identify material weaknesses that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of Section 404.. 29. Table of Contents. For example, in the past, certain matters involving our internal controls over financial reporting that constituted \"material weaknesses\" were identified and have since been remediated, which related to our limited accounting personnel and other resources at the time, as well as our adoption of public company standards. If we identify any additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, if we are required to make further restatements of our financial statements, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting once we are no longer an emerging growth company, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy, completeness or reliability of our financial reports and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected, and we could become subject to sanctions or investigations by the NYSE, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. In addition, if we fail to remedy any material weakness, our financial statements could be inaccurate and we could face restricted access to the capital markets.. We do not currently expect to pay any cash dividends.. The continued operation and expansion of our business will require substantial funding. Accordingly, we do not currently expect to pay any cash dividends on shares of our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. We are a holding company, and substantially all of our operations are carried out by our operating subsidiaries. Under our ABL Facility and Term Loan, our operating subsidiaries are significantly restricted in their ability to pay dividends or otherwise transfer assets to us, and we expect these limitations to continue in the future. Our ability to pay dividends may also be limited by the terms of any future credit agreement or any future debt or preferred equity securities of ours or of our subsidiaries.. The requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act and the NYSE, may strain our resources, increase our costs and divert management's attention, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost - effective manner.. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the corporate governance standards of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act and the NYSE. These requirements place a strain on our management, systems and resources and we incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Exchange Act requires us to file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition within specified time periods and to prepare a proxy statement with respect to our annual meeting of stockholders. The Sarbanes - Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. The NYSE requires that we comply with various corporate governance requirements. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting and comply with the Exchange Act and the NYSE's requirements, significant resources and management oversight are required. This may divert management's attention from other business concerns and lead to significant costs associated with compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on us and the price of our common stock.. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect that continuing compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time - consuming and costly. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult or costly for us to maintain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as our executive officers. Advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also prompt even more changes in governance and reporting requirements. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of these costs. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.. 30. Table of Contents. We are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the NYSE rules and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.. The Sponsors control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the NYSE corporate governance standards. A company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, a group or another company is a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the NYSE rules and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of the NYSE, including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe requirement that a majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe requirement that we have a nominating/corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.. We intend to continue to rely on all of the exemptions listed above for so long as we are eligible to do so. To the extent we utilize these exemptions, we will not have a majority of independent directors and our nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees will not consist entirely of independent directors. As a result, our board of directors and those committees may have more directors who do not meet the NYSE's independence standards than they would if those standards were to apply. The independence standards are intended to ensure that directors who meet those standards are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. Accordingly, our stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.. Taking advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \"emerging growth companies\" may make our common stock less attractive to investors.. As a company with less than $1.07 billion in revenue during fiscal year 2018, we qualify as an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe are not required to engage an auditor to report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe are not required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe are not required to submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as \"say - on - pay\", \"say - on - frequency\" and \"say - on - golden parachutes\"; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe are not required to disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer's compensation to median employee compensation.. We may take advantage of these provisions until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue, have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non - affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non - convertible debt over a three - year period.. 31. Table of Contents. The JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company like us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have irrevocably elected to \"opt out\" of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards as required when they are adopted.. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive to the extent we continue to rely on these exemptions, or if taking advantage of these exemptions would result in less active trading or more volatility in the price of our common stock.. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the DGCL or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our stockholders are deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us."
