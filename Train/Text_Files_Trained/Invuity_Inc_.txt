[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes thereto, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. The realization of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. In that event, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry. We currently are required to obtain additional funds to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds, we may be unable to invest in our sales and marketing efforts and research and development activities in order to growg our business. Additionally, we may not be able to secure these funds on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.. We have experienced significant operating losses, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the next several years as we implement additional initiatives designed to grow our business, including, among other things, increasing sales and developing new devices. We incurred net losses of $39.9 million, $40.6 million and $37.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, our accumulated deficit was $186.1 million. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have, for the foreseeable future, an adverse effect on our stockholders' deficit and working capital. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the one year period from the date of issuance of the financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities, certain debt-related financing arrangements and from sales of our approved devices. We have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development of our devices, sales and marketing activities and certain clinical and quality assurance initiatives. Our ability to generate sufficient revenue from our existing devices or from any of our device candidates in development, and to transition to profitability and generate consistent positive cash flows, is uncertain. We will need to generate significant sales to achieve profitability, and we might not be able to do so. If our revenue grows more slowly than we anticipate or if we fail to continue to grow our revenue, or if our operating expenses are higher than we expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability as anticipated, or ever, our financial condition will suffer and our stock price could decline. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.. 21. Table of Contents. Substantially all of our revenue to date has been generated from devices incorporating our Intelligent Photonics technology, and any decline in the sales of these devices or failure to gain market acceptance of these devices will negatively impact our business.. We have focused heavily on the development and commercialization of devices using our photonics technology platform for the illumination of certain open and minimal access surgeries. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our revenues of $39.6 million, $32.5 million, and $21.0 million, respectively, were derived entirely from sales of devices incorporating our Intelligent Photonics® technology. Because we expect our revenue to be derived substantially from sales of these devices for the foreseeable future, our ability to execute our growth strategy and become profitable will depend not only upon an increase in the number of hospitals using our devices, but also an increase in the number of specialties using our devices within those hospitals in which our devices are utilized. If our advanced photonics technology, and the devices that incorporate it, fail to achieve and maintain wide market acceptance for any reason, our business may be adversely affected, as we will be severely constrained in our ability to fund our operations and develop and commercialize improvements to existing and new product lines.. We introduced our PhotonBlade® device in 2017 and there can be no assurance on the level of market acceptance or revenue generated by this product.. In the third quarter of 2016, we announced that we had received FDA 510(k) clearance for PhotonBlade®, a new device that integrates our Intelligent Photonics® technology into an advanced energy device used for cutting and coagulation of soft-tissue during surgical procedures. We initiated a limited launch of the PhotonBlade® device in the first quarter of 2017 to obtain feedback from initial users with a goal of launching the product more broadly in the middle of 2017. Shortly after the limited launch, we received a small number of customer complaints which related to possible unintended energy discharge from the device with the potential to cause tissue damage to patients. In June 2017, we initiated a voluntary recall of the device. We redesigned the device to correct the performance issues that prompted the recall and relaunched the product in September of 2017. We cannot be assured that we have successfully redesigned the PhotonBlade® so as to eliminate the performance issues that prompted the recall. Furthermore, in light of the recall, we cannot be assured that the redesigned PhotonBlade® will achieve market acceptance. We will be required to devote significant resources to relaunch and market the PhotonBlade® and cannot be assured that these activities will generate revenue as anticipated. If our redesign of the device fails to successfully eliminate the performance issue or if our revenue grows more slowly than we expect, our business and financials will be adversely affected.. Failure to achieve revenue targets under our credit facility with MidCap would constitute an event of default, which may require us to repay the amounts outstanding under the facility earlier than expected.. Our credit facility with MidCap requires us to comply with a financial covenant relating to certain quarterly minimum Net Revenue requirements on a trailing twelve month basis. The minimum Net Revenue requirements on a trailing twelve month basis for 2018 is $40,488,151 for the period ending March 31, 2018, $42,248,214 for the period ending June 30, 2018, $46,574,986 for the period ending September 30, 2018, and $50,000,000 for the period ending December 31, 2018. If we do not achieve these quarterly minimum Net Revenue requirements, it would constitute a breach of the credit agreements, may cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreements, as amended, to become immediately due and payable and, if the Company was unable to obtain a waiver for this default, would permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit and permit the agent, on behalf of the lenders, to proceed against the collateral in which we granted the agent and the lenders a security interest. As of December 31, 2017, we had borrowed $30.0 million in term loans and drawn down $5.9 million under our revolving credit facility.. If we are unable to convince hospital facilities to approve the use of our devices, our sales may decrease.. In the United States, in order for surgeons to use our devices, the hospital facilities in which surgeons treat patients will typically require us to receive approval from the facility's Value Analysis Committee (\"VAC\"). VACs typically review the comparative effectiveness and cost of medical devices used in the facility. The makeup and evaluation processes for VACs vary considerably, and it can be a lengthy, costly and time-consuming effort to obtain approval by the relevant VAC. For example, even if we have an agreement with a hospital system for the purchase of our devices, in most cases, we must obtain VAC approval by each hospital within the system to sell at that particular hospital. Additionally, hospitals typically require separate VAC approval for each specialty in which our device is used, which may result in multiple VAC approval processes within the same hospital even if such device has already been approved for use by a different specialty group. We often need VAC approval for each different device to be used by surgeons in each discrete. 22. Table of Contents. specialty. In addition, hospital facilities and group purchasing organizations, or GPOs, which manage purchasing for multiple facilities, may also require us to enter into a purchasing agreement and satisfy numerous elements of their administrative procurement process, which can also be a lengthy, costly, and time-consuming effort. If we do not receive access to hospital facilities in a timely manner, or at all, via these VAC and purchasing contract processes, or otherwise, or if we are unable to secure contracts in a timely manner, or at all, our operating costs will increase, our sales may decrease, and our operating results may be harmed. Furthermore, we may expend significant effort and still be unable to obtain VAC approval or a purchase contract from hospitals or GPOs.. We must demonstrate to surgeons and hospitals the merits of our devices in order to facilitate greater adoption of our devices.. Surgeons play a significant role in determining the devices used in the operating room and assisting in obtaining approval by the relevant VAC. Educating surgeons on the benefits of our devices requires a significant commitment by our marketing team and sales organization. Surgeons and hospitals may be slow to change their practices because of perceived risks arising from the use of new devices, lack of experience using new devices, lack of clinical data supporting the benefits of such devices or the cost of new devices. We cannot predict when, or if ever, there will be widespread adoption of our devices by surgeons and hospitals. If we are unable to educate surgeons and hospitals about the advantages of our devices as compared to alternatives, we may face challenges in obtaining approval by the relevant VAC, and we will not achieve significantly greater market acceptance of our devices, gain momentum in our sales activities, significantly grow our market share or grow our revenue, and our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.. If we fail to develop and retain our direct sales force and independent sales agents, our business could suffer.. We currently sell our devices through our direct sales representatives in the United States. Our direct sales force works with independent sales agents or agencies, who assist us in educating targeted surgeons. Our operating results are dependent upon the sales and marketing efforts of our direct sales representatives. If our direct sales force fails to adequately promote, market and sell our devices, our sales may suffer.. As we launch new devices and increase our current marketing efforts with respect to existing devices and expand into new geographies, our future success will depend largely on our ability to continue to hire, train, retain and motivate skilled sales personnel with significant technical knowledge of our devices. We have made, and intend to continue to make, a significant investment in recruiting and training sales representatives. There is significant competition for sales personnel who are experienced in relevant medical device sales. Once hired, the training process is lengthy because of the significant education required to achieve the level of competency that surgeons expect from sales representatives with respect to understanding our devices. Upon completion of the training, our sales representatives typically require lead time in the field to grow their network of accounts and achieve the productivity levels we expect them to reach. If we are unable to attract, motivate, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales personnel, or if our sales representatives do not achieve the productivity levels we expect them to reach, our revenue will not grow at the rate we expect and our financial performance will suffer. Also, to the extent we hire personnel from our competitors, we may have to wait until applicable non-competition provisions expire before deploying such personnel in restricted territories, or else incur costs to relocate personnel outside of such territories, and we may be subject to allegations that such new hires have been improperly solicited, or that they have divulged to us proprietary or other confidential information.. We operate in a highly competitive market segment. If our competitors are better able to market and develop devices than we are able to market or develop devices, our business will be adversely impacted.. The medical device industry is highly competitive. Any device we develop will have to compete for market acceptance and market share. We believe that the primary competitive factors in the surgical illumination and visualization, advanced energy and fluorescent imaging market segments are clinical safety and effectiveness, price, surgeon experience and comfort with use of particular illumination systems, reliability and durability, ease of use, device support and service, sales force experience and relationships. We face significant competition from competitors based in the United States and internationally in these market segments, and we expect the intensity of competition will increase over time. Many of the companies developing or marketing competing products enjoy several competitive advantages over us, including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmore established sales and marketing programs and distribution networks;. 23. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlong established relationships with surgeons and hospitals;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontractual relationships with customers;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproducts that have already received approval from the relevant VACs;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgreater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgreater name recognition;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability to offer rebates or bundle multiple product offerings to offer greater discounts or incentives; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgreater experience in and resources for conducting research and development, clinical studies, manufacturing, preparing regulatory submissions, obtaining regulatory clearance or approval for products and marketing approved products.. Our competitors may develop and patent processes or devices earlier than us, obtain regulatory clearance or approvals for competing devices more rapidly than us or develop more effective or less expensive devices or technologies that render our technology or devices obsolete or less competitive. We also face fierce competition in recruiting and retaining qualified sales, scientific, and management personnel. If our competitors are more successful than us in these matters, our business may be harmed.. Our ability to sell our devices at prices necessary to support our current business strategies depends on demonstrating that the benefits of devices incorporating our technology outweigh the increased cost of such devices compared to alternatives.. Hospital and other healthcare provider customers that purchase our devices typically bill various third-party payors to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with the surgical procedures in which our devices are used and bill patients for any deductibles or copayments. Supplies used in surgery, such as our devices, are typically not separately reimbursed by third-party payors, but are rather included in the overall reimbursement for the procedure involved. Because there is no separate reimbursement for medical devices and supplies used in surgical procedures, the additional cost associated with the use of our devices can impact the profit margin of the hospital or surgery center where the surgery is performed. If reimbursement is inadequate, hospitals may choose to use less expensive instruments. Some of our target customers may be unwilling to adopt our devices in light of the additional associated cost. Our success depends on our ability to convince such cost-restricted customers that the potential benefits of using our devices, such as reduced surgery time, reduced surgery blood transfusion, and reduced post-surgery complications, outweigh the additional cost of such devices.. It is difficult to forecast future performance and our financial results may vary from forecasts and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.. Our limited operating history and commercial experience make it difficult for us to predict future performance and growth as such forecasts are limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to market our devices successfully, our ability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances, unexpected or serious complications related to our devices or other factors discussed in these risk factors. A number of factors over which we have limited control may contribute to fluctuations in our financial results. These factors include, without limitation:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsurgeon and hospital acceptance of our devices;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe productivity of our sales representatives;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe introduction of new devices and technologies or acquisitions by us or our competitors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in our expenses associated with expanding our operations and operating as a public company;. 24. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing, expense and results of research and development activities and obtaining future regulatory clearances and approvals;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsupplier, manufacturing or quality problems with our devices;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe impact and timing of taxes or changes in tax law; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in our pricing policies or in the pricing policies of our competitors or suppliers.. Additionally, we may experience seasonal variations in revenue. For example, our revenue tends to be the lowest in the first quarter as the result of the resetting of annual patient healthcare insurance plan deductibles and by hospitals and military facilities working off their inventories of products purchased in the fourth quarter. Revenue in the third quarter can be impacted by summer vacation season. Revenue in the fourth quarter tends to be the highest as demand may be impacted by the desire of patients to spend their remaining balances in their flexible spending accounts or because they have met their annual deductibles under their health insurance plans. In addition, in the fourth quarter, our results can be impacted by the budgeting and buying patterns of hospitals and military facilities.. The loss of one or more of our key customers could slow our revenue growth or cause our revenue to decline.. A material portion of our total revenue in any given period may come from a relatively small number of customers. We do not expect sales to these customers to increase significantly in the future, and as our revenue increases, we expect sales to these customers to decrease as a percent of revenue. However, the loss of any of our key customers for any reason, or a change in our relationship with any of our key customers may cause a significant decrease in our total revenue.. Our manufacturing operations are dependent upon third-party suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations, which could harm our business.. We rely on a number of suppliers who manufacture certain components of our devices, including specialty machining for our retractors and molding for Photonguides and handheld components. We do not have long-term supply agreements with most of our suppliers, and, in many cases, we purchase components on a purchase order basis. Our suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, failure to comply with applicable regulations, equipment malfunction and environmental factors, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand. Our reliance on these third-party suppliers also subjects us to other risks that could harm our business, including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe are not a major customer of many of our suppliers, and these suppliers may therefore give other customers' needs higher priority than ours;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may not be able to obtain an adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprice fluctuations due to a lack of long-term supply arrangements with our suppliers for components;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour suppliers, especially new suppliers, may make errors in manufacturing that could negatively affect the efficacy or safety of our devices or cause delays in shipment;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may have difficulty locating and qualifying alternative suppliers;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tswitching components or suppliers may require device redesign and possibly new premarket submissions to the FDA;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe failure of our suppliers to comply with strictly enforced regulatory requirements, which could result in disruption of supply and/or increased expenses;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe occurrence of a fire, natural disaster or other catastrophe impacting one or more of our suppliers may affect the supplier's ability to deliver components to us in a timely manner;. 25. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadditional political, business, logistical and regulatory risks affecting our relationships with international suppliers in China and South Korea;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour suppliers may encounter financial hardships unrelated to our demand, which could inhibit their ability to fulfill our orders and meet our requirements; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may encounter undesirable issues, such as the inability to exercise the same degree of quality control as we can our own facilities, with our overseas suppliers that may force us to find another supplier, which would create a delay in service.. In addition, we rely on single- and limited-source suppliers for several of our components and sub-assemblies. For example, the optical molding for Photonguides is provided by one supplier. These components are critical to our devices and there are relatively few alternative sources of supply. We do not carry a significant inventory of these components. Identifying and qualifying additional or replacement suppliers for any of these components or sub-assemblies used in our devices could involve significant time and cost.. Although we could temporarily assemble some of these components internally, we may incur greater costs, delay production or divert attention from other critical projects until we find an alternate source. Any interruption or delay in obtaining components from our third-party suppliers, or our inability to obtain components from qualified alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and cause them to switch to competing devices.. We are required to maintain high levels of inventory, which could consume a significant amount of our resources and reduce our cash flows.. We need to maintain substantial levels of inventory to protect ourselves from supply interruptions. In addition, because of the broad choice of devices we offer the many surgeon specialists who use our devices, we must maintain sufficient inventory on hand to ensure each order is filled when received, and we provide our sales representatives with trunk stock inventory to allow them to demonstrate the breath of our offering. As a result of our substantial inventory levels, we are subject to the risk that a substantial portion of our inventory could become obsolete, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows due to the resulting costs associated with the inventory impairment charges and costs required to replace such inventory. For example, we introduced our Eikon LT retractor series at the beginning of 2016 which quickly displaced its predecessor the Eikon Classic retractor series. As a result, we recorded a 100% reserve against finished good inventory on hand and trunk stock inventory held by our sales representatives for the Eikon Classic retractor series for the year ended December 31, 2016. In the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a charge of $456,000 related to on hand and trunk stock inventory that was obsolete due to a design modification to PhotonBlade®. We may need to write off inventory for other reasons as well.. We have limited clinical data to support the clinical and cost benefits of use of our devices, which could be a barrier to further surgeon adoption of our devices. For FDA purposes, our devices are classified as Class I, Class II exempt or Class II devices. Class I and Class II exempt devices do not require a 510(k) premarket notification. Our Class II devices, which require a 510(k) premarket notification, do not require clinical data or completion of clinical studies to obtain clearance for marketing. As a result, the FDA has not required, and we have not developed, clinical data supporting the cost effectiveness of our devices. Therefore, we currently lack clinical data supporting the benefits and cost effectiveness of our devices compared to other surgical solutions. As a result, surgeons may be slow to adopt or recommend our devices, and we may encounter difficulty obtaining approval from VACs. Further, any clinical studies that we initiate or the clinical experience of surgeons may indicate that our devices do not provide cost advantages over our competitors' surgical devices or that our devices do not deliver sufficient benefits to justify their cost. Such results could slow the adoption of our devices and significantly reduce our sales, which could harm our business and reputation.. We may need to conduct clinical studies in the future to support new device regulatory clearances or approvals, gain acceptance of our products in hospitals or to secure approval of the use of our devices in some foreign countries. Clinical testing is time-consuming and expensive and carries uncertain outcomes. The initiation and completion of any of these studies may be prevented, delayed or halted for numerous reasons. Moreover, we cannot assure you that the results of any clinical trials would support the promoted benefits of our devices. Failure or perceived failures in any clinical trials. 26. Table of Contents. will delay and may prevent our device development and regulatory clearance or approval processes, damage our business prospects and negatively affect our reputation and competitive position.. Our long-term growth depends on our ability to develop and commercialize additional devices.. The medical device industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change and technological advancements. Therefore, it is important to our business that we continue to enhance our device offerings and introduce new devices. Developing new devices is expensive and time-consuming and could divert management's attention away from our core business. Even if we are successful in developing additional devices, the success of any new device offering or enhancements to existing devices will depend on several factors, including our ability to:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproperly identify and anticipate surgeon and patient needs;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelop and introduce new devices or device enhancements in a timely manner;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelop an effective and dedicated sales and marketing team;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tavoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third-parties by developing our own intellectual property to protect our inventions;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdemonstrate, if required, the safety and efficacy of new devices with data from preclinical studies and clinical trials;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for new devices or device enhancements;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcomply with FDA regulations regarding the advertising and promotion of new devices or modified devices;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovide adequate training to potential users of our devices; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treceive adequate coverage and reimbursement for procedures performed with our devices.. If we are unsuccessful in developing and commercializing additional devices in other areas, our ability to increase our revenue may be impaired.. We may face product liability claims that could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities, and we may not be able to maintain adequate product liability insurance.. Our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical devices. This risk exists even if a device is cleared or approved for commercial sale by the FDA and manufactured in facilities licensed and regulated by the FDA or an applicable foreign regulatory authority. Manufacturing and marketing of our commercial devices, and clinical testing of our devices under development, may expose us to product liability and other tort claims. Additionally, regardless of the merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlitigation costs;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdistraction of management's attention from our primary business;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timpairment of our business reputation;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability to commercialize our devices;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdecreased demand for our devices or devices in development, if cleared or approved;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevice recall or withdrawal from the market;. 27. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twithdrawal of clinical trial participants;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; or. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of revenue.. Although we have, and intend to maintain, liability insurance, the coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate, and one or more successful claims brought against us may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. If we are unable to obtain insurance in the future at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms with adequate coverage, we will be exposed to significant liabilities.. Adverse litigation or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved in the normal course of our business could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.. From time to time, we are subject to allegations, claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business, which may include claims by third parties, including customers, competitors, employees or regulators. In this regard, we are currently subject to a securities litigation. In February 2017, a purported stockholder class action was filed against us, alleging that we made false or misleading statements about our business to investors who purchased our common stock between July 19, 2016 and November 3, 2016 in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and the SEC Rule 10b - 5. This securities litigation is discussed in greater detail under Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\" and Note 7, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 - K.. Additionally, one of our employees has received a letter from Medtronic PLC, or Medtronic, indicating a concern about \"inevitable disclosure\" of trade secrets, which did not relate to specific accusations of actual misconduct. We may be subject to litigation as a result of this letter or others that we or our employees may receive in the future. In December 2016, Medtronic, which competes with us across multiple product lines, filed a civil complaint in the State Court of Minnesota against us, alleging tortious interference with contract, and two of our sales employees, alleging breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of duty of loyalty. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages. Additionally, in connection with the civil complaint, a temporary restraining order was filed against us and the two named employees to stop the employees from selling PhotonBlade®. In January 2017, the State Court of Minnesota entered into a temporary restraining order against us, relating to sales by the two employees of PhotonBlade®. A temporary injunction hearing was held in May 2017, and the court entered an order in July 2017, granting in part and denying in part the motion for temporary injunction. This lawsuit is scheduled for trial in April 2018. We are incurring and expect to continue incurring significant costs related to defending this action.. The outcome of these and other proceedings cannot be predicted. We intend to defend any proceedings vigorously. If any proceedings were to be determined adversely against us or resulted in legal actions, claims, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or judgments, fines, or settlements involving a payment of material sums of money, or if injunctive relief were issued against us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Even the successful defense of legal proceedings may cause us to incur substantial legal costs and may divert management's attention and resources.. Our ability to maintain our competitive position depends on our ability to attract, integrate and retain highly qualified personnel.. We believe that our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key personnel. Our executive officers and other key personnel are critical to the strategic direction and overall management of our company as well as our research and development process. All of our executive officers and other employees are at-will employees and, therefore, may terminate employment with us at any time with no advance notice. The loss of any of our executive officers and other key personnel could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. Our productivity may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively.. We invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. Many of our competitors have greater resources than we have. We do not carry any \"key person\". 28. Table of Contents. insurance policies. The replacement of any of our key personnel likely would involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and would harm our business.. In addition, our employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own or the shares underlying their vested options have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares or the exercise prices of the options, or if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly below the market price of our common stock.. On February 27, 2018, Philip Sawyer informed the board of directors that he will resign from his role as President, Chief Executive Officer, and a member of our board of directors, effective as of February 28, 2018. Scott Flora, currently serving as a member of our board of directors, assumed the additional role of Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, and as such became the Company's principal executive officer effective on March 1, 2018.. The board of directors will commence a search to recruit a permanent successor with the assistance of a leading executive search firm. These changes in the Company's management team and to the board of directors, may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, the Company's business, and any additional changes to the management team or the board of directors could have a negative impact on the Company's ability to manage and grow its business effectively. In addition, if the Company is not effective in its succession planning, it may have a negative impact on the Company's ability to successfully recruit for its management team. Any such disruption or uncertainty or difficulty in efficiently and effectively filling key management roles could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and/or the price of the Company's common stock.. If we fail to properly manage our anticipated growth, our business could suffer.. We have been growing in recent periods and have a relatively short history of operating as a commercial company. We intend to continue to grow and may experience periods of rapid growth and expansion. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on management, including the need to identify, recruit, train and integrate additional employees. In addition, rapid and significant growth will place a strain on our administrative personnel, information technology systems and other operational infrastructure. Any failure by us to manage our growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals. To achieve our revenue goals, we must continue to hire, train, retain and motivate skilled personnel.. In order to manage our operations and growth, we will need to continue to improve our operational and management controls, reporting and information technology systems and financial internal control procedures. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, it may be difficult for us to execute our business strategy and our operating results and business could suffer.. We must also successfully increase production output to meet expected customer demand. In the future, we may experience difficulties with production yields and quality control, component supply, and shortages of qualified personnel, among other problems. These problems could result in delays in product availability and increases in expenses. Any such delay or increased expense could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.. Our ability to achieve profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to reduce the per unit manufacturing cost of our current devices and attain a low per unit manufacturing cost for our future devices.. Currently, the gross profit generated from the sale of our devices is not sufficient to cover our operating expenses. To achieve profitability, we need to, among other things, reduce the per unit manufacturing cost of our current devices and attain low per unit manufacturing costs for our future devices, including the PhotonBlade®. This cannot be achieved without improving manufacturing efficiency and increasing our manufacturing volume to leverage manufacturing overhead costs. If we are unable to improve manufacturing efficiency and reduce manufacturing overhead costs per unit, our ability to achieve profitability will be constrained. Any increase in manufacturing volumes is dependent upon a corresponding increase in sales. The occurrence of one or more factors that negatively impact the manufacturing or sales of our devices or reduce our manufacturing efficiency may prevent us from achieving our desired decrease in manufacturing costs, which would prevent us from attaining profitability.. 29. Table of Contents. If our facilities are damaged or become inoperable, we will be unable to continue to research, develop and manufacture our devices and, as a result, there will be an adverse impact on our business until we are able to secure a new facility.. We do all of our internal manufacturing, development and management activities in a single location in San Francisco, California. Our facility and equipment would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. The facility may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, flooding, fire, vandalism and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our research, development, manufacturing and commercialization activities for some period of time. While we have taken precautions to safeguard our facilities, including through insurance and health and safety protocols, the inability to perform those activities may result in the inability to continue manufacturing our devices during such periods and the loss of customers or harm to our reputation. We also possess insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and this insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.. We have limited prior experience selling devices outside of the United States. If we commercialize any devices outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could adversely impact our net sales, results of operations and financial condition.. We currently sell our devices in the United States and began selling in Asia in June 2017. We also expect to expand sales to Europe and other regions, both directly and through distributors, which will require us to identify and develop relationships with distributors who will focus on marketing our devices.. The sale and shipment of our devices across international borders, as well as the purchase of components from international sources, such as from suppliers in China and South Korea, subject us to United States and foreign governmental trade, import and export, and customs regulations and laws. Compliance with these regulations and laws is costly and exposes us to penalties for non-compliance. Other laws and regulations that can significantly impact us include various anti-bribery laws, including the FCPA and anti-boycott laws, as well as export controls laws. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments, restrictions on certain business activities and exclusion or debarment from government contracting. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our shipping and sales activities.. Additionally, the countries into which we expand our sales in the future may have different practices than the United States regarding the use of disposable medical devices. In the United States, our single-use optical waveguides, called Photonguides, for use with reusable retractors, single-use handheld illuminated aspiration devices, PhotonBlade®, and single-use drop-in intracavity illuminators are not reused, whereas surgeons in some countries may reuse our single-use devices. Customers in these countries may be less willing to purchase our single-use devices as they were not designed to be reusable, or they may purchase fewer of our single-use devices than United States-based customers purchase, because they choose to reuse our devices rather than purchasing additional single-use devices from us.. International operations will expose us and our distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These risks include:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties in obtaining, enforcing or defending intellectual property rights;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpricing pressure that we may experience internationally;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta shortage of high-quality sales people and distributors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthird-party reimbursement policies that may require some of the patients who receive our devices to directly absorb medical costs or that may necessitate the reduction of the selling prices of our devices;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompetitive disadvantage with established businesses and customer relationships;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe imposition of additional United States and foreign governmental controls or regulations;. 30. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teconomic instability;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in duties and tariffs, license obligations and other non-tariff barriers to trade;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives and distributors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tscrutiny of foreign tax authorities which could result in significant fines, penalties and additional taxes being imposed on us;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlaws and business practices favoring local companies;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlonger payment cycles;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties in maintaining consistency with our internal guidelines;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe imposition of costly and lengthy new export licensing requirements;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe imposition of U.S. or international sanctions against a country, company, person or entity with whom we do business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with the sanctioned country, company, person or entity; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe imposition of new trade restrictions.. If we experience any of these risks, our sales in international countries may be harmed and our results of operations would suffer.. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and toxic materials, and we must comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which can be expensive, and could have an adverse impact on our business.. Our operations use or generate small volumes of hazardous or toxic materials. We are, therefore, subject to a variety of federal, state and local regulations relating to the use, handling, storage, disposal and human exposure to hazardous and toxic materials. Liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault, and environmental laws could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, which could have an adverse impact on our business. Although we believe that our activities conform in all material respects with environmental, health and safety laws, there can be no assurance that violations of environmental, health and safety laws will not occur in the future as a result of human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes. The failure to comply with past, present or future laws could result in the imposition of fines, third-party property damage and personal injury claims, investigation and remediation costs, the suspension of production or a cessation of operations. We also expect that our operations will be affected by other new environmental and health and safety laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any such new laws and regulations, they will likely result in additional costs, and may require us to change how we manufacture our devices, which could have an adverse impact on our business. We cannot predict what impact the new administration will have on the political and regulatory environment in the United States, the timing of any such changes, or the impact of any such changes on our business.. We may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management's attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.. We may in the future seek to acquire or invest in companies or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various costs and expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. We may not be able to identify. 31. Table of Contents. desirable acquisition targets, be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular target, or obtain the expected benefits of any acquisition or investment.. To date, the growth in our business has been organic, and we have no experience in acquiring other businesses. In any acquisition, we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired personnel, operations and technologies, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, the use of our available cash or the incurrence of debt, which could harm our operating results. In addition, if an acquired company or technology fails to meet our expectations, or if we are unable to integrate any acquired company or technology, our operating results, business and financial condition may suffer.. Failure to protect our information technology infrastructure against cyber-based attacks, network security breaches, service interruptions, or data corruption could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operating results.. We rely on information technology and telephone networks and systems, including the Internet, to process and transmit sensitive electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including sales, billing, customer service, procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, and distribution. We use enterprise information technology systems to record, process, and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. We are not aware of any breaches of our information technology infrastructure. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent breakdowns in our information technology and telephone systems, if our systems suffer severe damage or disruption or shutdown and we are unable to effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business and operating results may suffer.. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property. If our intellectual property rights are not adequately protected, our business will be negatively affected.. Our success depends in large part on our intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and know-how. The steps we have taken and may take in the future to protect our intellectual property may not adequately prevent misappropriation or ensure that others will not develop competitive technologies or devices. We cannot assure you that our competitors will not successfully challenge the validity or ownership of our patents or design products that avoid infringement of our proprietary rights with respect to our technology. There can be no assurance that other companies are not investigating or developing other similar technologies, that any patents will be issued from any application pending or filed by us, or that, if patents are issued, the issued claims will be sufficiently broad to deter or prohibit others from marketing similar devices. We may also not be able to detect infringement of our patents by third parties. In addition, we cannot assure you that any patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that the rights under those patents will provide a competitive advantage to us or that our devices and technology will be adequately covered by our patents and other intellectual property. Additionally, as our patents expire, we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through adjustments in patent term. The expiration of, or the failure to maintain or extend our patents, could have a material adverse effect on us.. Furthermore, we do not have any patent rights in certain foreign countries in which a market may exist in the future, and the laws of many foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. The scope of our patent claims may vary between countries, as individual countries have distinctive patent laws. Thus, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing and selling in certain foreign countries devices that are the same as or similar to our devices.. We also own trade secrets and confidential information that we try to protect by entering into invention assignment and confidentiality agreements with our employees and other parties. However, these agreements may not be honored or, if breached, we may not have sufficient remedies to protect our confidential or proprietary information. Further, our competitors may independently learn our trade secrets and develop similar or superior technologies. To the extent that our consultants, key employees or others apply technological information to our projects that they develop independently or others develop, disputes may arise regarding the ownership of proprietary rights to such information, and such. 32. Table of Contents. disputes may not be resolved in our favor. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property adequately, our business and commercial prospects will suffer.. The medical device industry is characterized by extensive patent litigation, and we could become subject to patent or other proprietary rights litigation that could be costly to defend or settle, result in the diversion of management's attention, require us to pay significant damages or royalty payments or prevent us from marketing and selling our existing or future devices, and, if adversely adjudicated, could harm our business.. Our success depends, in part, on not infringing the patents or violating the proprietary rights of others. Significant litigation regarding patent rights occurs in the medical device industry. It is possible that U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications controlled by third parties may be alleged to cover our devices. Our competitors in both the United States and abroad, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use, sell, or offer to sell our devices. We or our employees may receive in the future and have received in the past, particularly as a public company, communications from patent holders or other third parties, including non-practicing entities, alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights, actual or potential future misappropriation of trade secrets, or offering licenses to such intellectual property. In this regard, one of our employees has received a letter from Medtronic indicating a concern about \"inevitable\" disclosure of trade secrets, which did not relate to specific accusations of actual misconduct. We may be subject to litigation as a result of this letter or others that we or our employees may receive in the future.. In December 2016, Medtronic, which competes with us across multiple product lines, filed a civil complaint in the State Court of Minnesota against us, alleging tortious interference with contract, and two of our sales employees, alleging breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of duty of loyalty. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages. Additionally, in connection with the civil complaint, a temporary restraining order was filed against us and the two named employees to stop the employees from selling PhotonBlade®. In January 2017, the State Court of Minnesota entered into a temporary restraining order against us, relating to sales by the two employees of PhotonBlade®. A temporary injunction hearing was held in May 2017, and the court entered an order in July 2017, granting in part and denying in part the motion for temporary injunction. This lawsuit is scheduled for trial in April 2018. We are incurring and could continue to incur significant costs related to defending this action.. At any given time, we may be involved as either a plaintiff or a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions related to other proprietary rights, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Such intellectual property litigation is typically costly and time-consuming. Litigation proceedings, if instituted against us, could divert our management's and technical team's attention and resources. Adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or injunctions, or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and, if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms, prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using certain devices, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, some licenses may be nonexclusive, which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies. Third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or, if possible, negotiate licenses from such third parties. Such licenses may materially increase our expenses.. The large number of patents, the rapid rate of new patent applications and issuances, the complexities of the technologies involved and the uncertainty of litigation significantly increase the risks related to patents or other proprietary rights. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstop selling, offering to sell, making, or using devices that use the disputed intellectual property;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtain a license from the intellectual property owner to continue selling, offering to sell, making, licensing, or using devices, which license may require substantial royalty payments and may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur significant legal expenses;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpay substantial damages, treble damages, or royalties to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;. 33. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpay the attorney fees and costs of litigation to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tredesign those devices that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property, which could be costly, disruptive and/or infeasible.. If any of the foregoing occurs, we may have to withdraw existing devices from the market or may be unable to commercialize one or more of our devices, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any litigation or claim against us, even those without merit, may cause us to incur substantial costs and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our reputation. Further, as the number of participants in the industry grows, the possibility of intellectual property infringement claims against us increases.. In addition, we may be required to indemnify our customers, distributors and OEM partners with respect to infringement by our devices of the proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers or distributors which may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers or distributors, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or distributors or may be required to obtain licenses for the devices they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our devices.. Risks Related to Our Capital Structure. We currently are required to obtain additional funds and may also be required to obtain additional funds in the future, and these funds may not be available on acceptable terms at all.. Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception, and we anticipate our expenses will increase as we seek to continue to grow our business and transition to operating as a public company. We believe that our growth will depend, in part, on our ability to fund our commercialization efforts and our efforts to develop new technologies, as well as technology complementary to our current devices. Our existing resources may not allow us to conduct all of these activities that we believe would be beneficial for our future growth. As a result, we intend to obtain additional funding through public or private financing, collaborative arrangements with strategic partners, or through additional credit lines or other debt financing sources to increase the funds available to fund operations. If we are unable to raise funds on favorable terms, or at all, we may not be able to support our commercialization efforts or increase our research and development activities and the growth of our business may be negatively impacted. As a result, we may be unable to compete effectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our net cash used in operating activities was $38.9 million, $36.6 million, and $31.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $22.7 million, which included $21.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our cash requirements in the future may be significantly different from our current estimates and depend on many factors, including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe results of our commercialization efforts for our existing and future devices, including international expansion;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe rate at which we continue to grow our direct sales force and increase our marketing activities;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe establishment of high volume manufacturing;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe need for additional capital to fund future development programs;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents or any litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour success in entering into collaborative relationships with other parties.. 34. Table of Contents. To finance these activities, we may seek funds through borrowings or through additional rounds of financing, including private or public equity or debt offerings and collaborative arrangements with corporate partners. In July 2016, in order to facilitate the raising of additional funds, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S - 3 (Registration No. 333 - 212395) that allows us to sell up to an aggregate of $100,000,000 of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depository shares and/or units. In July 2016, we also filed a prospectus supplement for an at-the-market, or ATM, program of up to $25.0 million. In August 2016, we sold 3,220,000 shares in a secondary offering pursuant to this shelf registration and a prospectus supplement. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. In March 2017, we also entered into a debt agreement with MidCap (as defined below), as amended in September 2017, for up to $30.0 million in term loans and up to $20.0 million under a revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, we had borrowed $30.0 million in term loans and drawn down $5.9 million under our revolving credit facility. This debt arrangement imposes upon us, and any future debt financing into which we enter may impose upon us covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. See below for more information. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third-parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our devices, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Additionally, we cannot be certain that we will have access to the full amount available under our revolving credit agreement with MidCap if we fail to achieve certain revenue thresholds or meet other conditions, or that we will be able to renegotiate the terms of our credit facility to access further funding. We may not be able to issue equity securities under our shelf registration statement or ATM program due to unacceptable terms and conditions to us in the capital markets. If we do not have, or are not able to obtain, sufficient funds, we may have to reduce our cash burn rate, delay hiring of new staff, delay research and development projects, delay development or commercialization of our devices in development, license to third parties the rights to commercialize devices or technologies that we would otherwise seek to commercialize, and reduce discretionary operating expenses. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or to raise adequate funds to finance our forecasted expenditures, we may have to liquidate some or all of our assets, or delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our development programs. We also may have to reduce sales, marketing, engineering, customer support or other resources devoted to our existing products, or cease operations. Any of these actions could impede our ability to achieve our business objectives and harm our operating results. As a result of our obligations and lack of immediately available financial resources, there is uncertainty regarding our ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate our business effectively, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, includes a going concern explanatory paragraph stating that our recurring losses from operations and net capital deficiency raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, which currently consists of our credit agreements with MidCap.. On March 10, 2017, we entered into a credit and security agreement with MidCap Financial Trust and their affiliates, or MidCap, that provides for up to $30.0 million in term loans. On September 26, 2017, we amended this credit and security agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, we borrowed the first term loan of $20.0 million on March 10, 2017 and an additional term loan of $10.0 million on September 26, 2017. The term loans accrue interest at a floating rate equal to 6.50% per annum, plus the greater of (i) 1.5% or (ii) one month LIBOR. Principal is payable in 36 equal monthly installments beginning April 1, 2019, subject to extension to October 1, 2019 if the Company achieves a certain revenue target, until paid in full on March 1, 2022. In connection with entry into the credit and security agreement with MidCap, we terminated the HCRP loan agreement and used a portion of the term loan proceeds to repay all amounts outstanding under such agreement.. Also on March 10, 2017, we entered into a separate credit and security agreement with MidCap that provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $10.0 million based on the eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances. On September 26, 2017, we amended this credit and security agreement. As of December 31, 2017, we have outstanding borrowings of $5.9 million under this revolving credit facility. We may increase the total commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to an additional $10.0 million, subject to certain conditions. Loans under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at a floating rate equal to 3.25% per annum, plus the greater of (i) 1.5% or (ii) one month LIBOR. The facility terminates in full on March 1, 2022 unless terminated earlier. This new revolving credit facility. 35. Table of Contents. replaces our $7.5 million accounts receivable credit facility that existed with SVB, under which no principal or interest was outstanding.. Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on numerous factors, including the amount of our cash balances and our actual and projected financial and operating performance. These amounts and our performance are subject to certain financial and business factors, as well as prevailing economic and competitive conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash balances or cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our existing or future indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our future working capital, borrowings or equity financing could be unavailable to repay or refinance the amounts outstanding under the loan agreements, and even if they were, these actions may be insufficient to permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, in the event of our breach of the credit agreements with MidCap, we may not be allowed to draw additional amounts and we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts earlier than anticipated. In the event of a liquidation, MidCap would be repaid all outstanding principal, premium, if any, and interest prior to distribution of assets to unsecured creditors, and the holders of our common stock would receive a portion of any liquidation proceeds only if all of our creditors, including MidCap, were first repaid in full.. The credit agreements, as amended, with MidCap contain restrictive covenants that may limit our operating flexibility.. Borrowings under the credit agreements, as amended, with MidCap are secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property. The credit agreements, as amended, with MidCap contain customary restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to dispose of assets, undergo a change in control, merge or consolidate, make acquisitions, incur debt, incur liens, pay dividends, repurchase stock and make investments, in each case subject to certain exceptions. We, therefore, may not be able to engage in any of the foregoing transactions unless we obtain the consent of our lenders. We must also comply with a financial covenant relating to certain quarterly minimum Net Revenue requirements on a trailing twelve month basis. The minimum Net Revenue requirements on a trailing twelve month basis for 2018 is $40,488,151 for the period ending March 31, 2018, $42,248,214 for the period ending June 30, 2018, $46,574,986 for the period ending September 30, 2018, and $50,000,000 for the period ending December 31, 2018.. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the credit agreements, as amended, as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into, could restrict our ability to finance our operations and to engage in, expand or otherwise pursue business activities and strategies that we or our stockholders may consider beneficial. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and future breaches of any of these covenants could result in a default under the credit agreements, as amended. Future defaults, if not waived, could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreements, as amended, to become immediately due and payable and would permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit and permit the agent, on behalf of the lenders, to proceed against the collateral in which we granted the agent and the lenders a security interest.. Our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations; in addition, we may be unable to use a substantial part of our net operating losses if we do not attain profitability in an amount necessary to offset such losses.. As of December 31, 2017, we had net operating loss, or NOLs, carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $171.0 million and $124.8 million, respectively. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or Section 382, a corporation that undergoes an \"ownership change\" is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. Our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo an ownership change in the future, our ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited by Section 382. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could also result in an ownership change under Section 382. Furthermore, we may be unable to use a substantial part of our NOLs if we do not attain profitability in an amount sufficient to offset such losses. Any limitation on using NOLs could result in our retaining less cash after payment of U.S. federal and state income taxes during any year in which we have taxable income than we would be entitled to retain if such NOLs were available as an offset. 36. Table of Contents. against such income for U.S. federal income and state tax reporting purposes, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Reform Act\") was enacted on December 22, 2017 and provides for significant changes to U.S. tax law. Among other provisions, the Tax Reform Act reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21%, effective in 2018. As a result, the Company has remeasured its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the lower rate expected to apply when these temporary differences reverse. The Company estimates that the remeasurement resulted in a decrease in deferred tax assets of $22.5 million, which was fully offset by a corresponding change to the Company's valuation allowance. The impact will likely be subject to ongoing technical guidance and accounting interpretation, which the Company will continue to monitor and assess.. Risks Related to Government Regulation. Our business is subject to extensive governmental regulation that could make it more expensive and time consuming for us to introduce new or improved devices.. Our devices are medical devices and must comply with regulatory requirements imposed by the FDA in the United States and similar agencies in foreign jurisdictions. While our current devices are classified as Class I, Class II 510(k) exempt, or Class II medical devices in the United States and, with respect to our Class I and Class II exempt devices, are not subject to premarket clearance or approval by the FDA, these requirements could change and new devices may be subject to more extensive regulation. Premarket clearance or approval has become more stringent over time and can involve lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures and an extensive agency review process, and other costly and time-consuming procedures. It often takes several years to satisfy these requirements depending on the complexity and novelty of the device. We also are subject to numerous additional licensing and regulatory requirements relating to safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances.. Government regulation may impede our ability to develop and manufacture our existing and future devices. Government regulation also could delay our marketing of new devices for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures on our activities. The FDA and other regulatory agencies may not approve or clear any of our future devices on a timely basis, if at all. Any delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, such approvals or clearances could negatively impact our marketing of any future devices and reduce our device revenues.. Our devices remain subject to strict regulatory controls on manufacturing, advertising and promotion. We may be forced to modify or recall a device after release in response to regulatory action or unanticipated difficulties encountered in general use. Any such action could have a material adverse effect on the reputation of our devices and on our business and financial position.. Further, regulations may change, and any additional regulation could limit or restrict our ability to use any of our technologies, which could harm our business. We could also be subject to new international, federal, state or local regulations that could affect our research and development programs and harm our business in unforeseen ways. If this happens, we may have to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations, which will harm our results of operations.. If we fail to obtain and maintain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for our devices, or if clearances or approvals for future devices and indications are delayed or not issued, our commercial operations would be harmed.. Our devices are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by regulatory agencies in other countries where we plan to do business. Government regulations specific to medical devices are wide-ranging and govern, among other things:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevice design, development and manufacture;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlaboratory, preclinical and clinical testing, labeling, packaging, storage and distribution;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpremarketing clearance and approval;. 37. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trecord keeping;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevice marketing, promotion and advertising, sales and distribution; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpost-marketing surveillance, including reporting of deaths and serious injuries and recalls and correction and removals.. Before a new medical device, or a new intended use for, an existing device can be marketed in the United States, a company must first submit and receive either 510(k) clearance or premarketing approval, or PMA from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. In the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA will determine that a proposed device is \"substantially equivalent\" to a device legally on the market, known as a \"predicate\" device, with respect to intended use, technology and safety and effectiveness, in order to clear the proposed device for marketing. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. The PMA pathway requires an applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device based on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. Products that are approved through a PMA application generally need FDA approval before they can be modified. Similarly, some modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) may require a new 510(k). Either process can be expensive, lengthy and unpredictable. We may not be able to obtain the necessary clearances or approvals or may be unduly delayed in doing so, which could harm our business. Furthermore, even if we are granted regulatory clearances or approvals, they may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for the device, which may limit the market for the device. Although we have obtained 510(k) clearance to market our sterilization trays, our clearance can be revoked if safety or efficacy problems develop.. In addition, we are required to timely file various reports with the FDA, including reports required by the medical device reporting regulations, or MDRs, that require we report to the regulatory authorities if our devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. If these reports are not filed in a timely manner, regulators may impose sanctions and sales of our devices may suffer, and we may be subject to product liability or regulatory enforcement actions, all of which could harm our business. If we initiate a correction or removal for one of our devices to reduce a risk to health posed by the device, we would be required to submit a publically available Correction and Removal report to the FDA and in many cases, similar reports to other regulatory agencies. This report could be classified by the FDA as a device recall which could lead to increased scrutiny by the FDA, other international regulatory agencies and our customers regarding the quality and safety of our devices. Furthermore, the submission of these reports has been and could be used by competitors against us in competitive situations and cause customers to delay purchase decisions or cancel orders and would harm our reputation. In June 2017, we submitted a Correction and Removal report to the FDA in connection with the voluntary recall of our PhotonBlade® product, and had not received additional information from the FDA that would increase our exposure to additional risks.. The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, also regulate the advertising and promotion of our devices to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that there are adequate and reasonable data to substantiate the claims and that our promotional labeling and advertising is neither false nor misleading in any respect. If the FDA or FTC determines that any of our advertising or promotional claims are misleading, not substantiated or not permissible, we may be subject to enforcement actions, including FDA warning letters, and we may be required to revise our promotional claims and make other corrections or restitutions.. FDA and state authorities have broad enforcement powers. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA or state agencies, which may include any of the following sanctions:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse publicity, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trepair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our devices;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toperating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trefusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new devices, new intended uses or modifications to existing devices;. 38. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twithdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcriminal prosecution.. If any of these events were to occur, our business and financial condition would be harmed.. The misuse of our devices may harm our image in the marketplace, result in injuries that lead to product liability lawsuits, which could be costly to our business, or result in costly investigations and FDA sanctions if we are deemed to have engaged in such promotion.. Surgeons may misuse our devices or use improper techniques if they are not adequately trained, potentially leading to injury and an increased risk of product liability. If our devices are misused or used with improper technique, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients. Product liability claims could divert management's attention from our core business, be expensive to defend, and result in sizable damage awards against us that may not be covered by insurance. Any of these events could significantly harm our business and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.. Our devices may, in the future, be subject to recalls or voluntary market withdrawals that could harm our reputation, business and financial results.. The FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized devices in the event of material deficiencies or defects in the design, manufacture or labeling of the device that could affect patient safety or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death. Further, under the FDA's MDR regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, conduct a field action notice or correction to inform surgeons of changes to instructions for use or of a deficiency, or of a suspected deficiency, found in a device. A government-mandated recall or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other issues.. Repeated product malfunctions may result in a voluntary or involuntary product recall, which could divert managerial and financial resources, impair our ability to manufacture our products in a cost-effective and timely manner and have an adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and operating results. For example, shortly after the limited launch of PhotonBlade® we received a small number of customer complaints which related to possible unintended energy discharge from the device with the potential to cause tissue damage to patients. In June 2017, we initiated a voluntary recall of the device. We will be required to devote significant resources to relaunch and market the PhotonBlade® and cannot be assured that these activities will generate revenue as anticipated. If our redesign of the device fails to successfully eliminate the performance issue or if our revenue grows more slowly than we expect, our business and financials will be adversely affected.. Depending on the corrective action we take to address a product's deficiencies or defects, the FDA may require, or we may decide, that we will need to obtain new approvals or clearances for the device before we may market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such approvals or clearances may delay our ability to replace the recalled devices in a timely manner. Moreover, if we do not adequately address problems associated with our devices, we may face additional regulatory enforcement action, including FDA warning letters, product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties, or civil or criminal fines. We may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our sales as well as face significant adverse publicity or regulatory consequences, which could harm our business, including our ability to market our products in the future.. Any adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or regulatory agency action, which could include inspection, mandatory recall or other enforcement action. Recalls, which include certain notifications and corrections as well as removals, of any of our devices, could divert managerial and financial resources and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, harm our reputation with customers, and reduce our ability to achieve expected revenues.. 39. Table of Contents. Material modifications to our devices may require new 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals or may require us to recall or cease marketing our devices until clearances or approvals are obtained.. Material modifications to the intended use or technological characteristics of our devices will require new 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals, or require us to recall or cease marketing the modified devices until these clearances or approvals are obtained. The FDA requires device manufacturers to initially make and document a determination of whether or not a modification requires a new approval, supplement, or clearance; however, the FDA can review a manufacturer's decision. Any modification to an FDA-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would constitute a material modification and would require a new 510(k) clearance or possibly a premarket approval. We may not be able to obtain additional 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals for new devices or for modifications to, additional indications for, our devices in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining required future clearances would harm our ability to introduce new or enhanced devices in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth. We have made modifications to our devices in the past and will make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals. If the FDA disagrees and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications, we may be required to recall and to stop selling or marketing our devices as modified, which could harm our operating results and require us to redesign our platform devices. In these circumstances, we may also be subject to significant enforcement actions such as significant regulatory fines or penalties.. If we or our suppliers fail to comply with the FDA's Quality System Regulation, our manufacturing operations could be delayed or shut down and our sales could suffer.. Our manufacturing processes and those of our third-party suppliers are required to comply with the FDA's Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which covers the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of our devices. We are also subject to similar state requirements and licenses. In addition, we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic announced and unannounced inspections by governmental agencies, including the FDA, state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries. If we fail a Quality System inspection, our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing interrupted. Failure to take adequate and prompt corrective action in response to an adverse Quality System inspection could result in, among other things, a partial or total shut-down of our manufacturing operations, significant fines, consent decrees, injunctions, untitled letters, warning letters, injunctions, customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products, suspension of marketing clearances and approvals, seizures or recalls of our devices, operating restrictions, refusal to grant export approval for our products, refusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products or modified products, withdrawing 510(k) clearances or pre-market approvals that have already been granted, and criminal prosecutions, any of which would cause our business to suffer. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, which may result in manufacturing delays for our devices and cause revenues to decline.. We have registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and have obtained a manufacturing license from the California Department of Public Health, or CDPH. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of CDPH to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers. We passed the most recent audit by the Food and Drug Branch of CDPH in February 2015, and the inspection revealed no minor or major issues. We were also subjected to an FDA inspection in April 2016 resulting in two observations. The FDA will evaluate and validate whether our corrective actions have been effective during its next inspection, which has not be scheduled. However, we cannot assure you that we will pass future inspections or audits by the FDA or other regulatory bodies or that the FDA will consider the observations it previously identified to be closed out.. 40. Table of Contents. We may be subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations, and a finding of failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.. Our operations are, and will continue to be, directly and indirectly affected by various federal, state or foreign healthcare laws, including, but not limited to, those described below. These laws include:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation; in addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfederal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. Lawsuits filed under the False Claims Act, known as \"qui tam\" actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \"whistleblowers\", may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary's decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfederal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any federal healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other \"transfers of value\" made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to the government ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members and payments or other \"transfers of value\" to such physician owners. Manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS by the 90th day of each calendar year. Failure to submit the required information may result in civil monetary penalties up to an aggregate of $165,786 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1.105 million per year for \"knowing failures\") for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity; the United Kingdom Bribery Act, which prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors;. 41. Table of Contents. and bribery provisions contained in the German Criminal Code, which, pursuant to draft legislation being prepared by the German government, may make the corruption and corruptibility of physicians in private practice and other healthcare professionals a criminal offense; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tanalogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or that otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our consulting agreements and other relationships with surgeons and other healthcare providers, some of whom receive stock or stock options as compensation for their services and/or recommend, purchase and/or use our devices, group purchasing organizations and our independent sales agents and distributors, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. We are also exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors, independent sales agents and distributors may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. While we have policies and procedures in place prohibiting such activity, misconduct by these parties could include, among other infractions or violations, intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or unauthorized activity that violates FDA regulations, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA, manufacturing standards, federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data or other commercial or regulatory laws or requirements. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations.. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us now or in the future, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from governmental health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business.. We may fail to obtain foreign regulatory approvals to market our devices in other countries.. In June 2017, we expanded sales to Asia, and we expect to expand sales to Europe. Prior to such date, we did not have any direct sales outside of the United States. Our corporate partners, however, sell certain of our devices outside of the United States and have already obtained the necessary regulatory approvals to sell certain of our devices outside of the United States. Sales of our devices outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. In addition, the FDA regulates the exports of medical devices from the United States. Complying with international regulatory requirements can be an expensive and a time-consuming process and clearance or approval is not certain. The time required to obtain clearances or approvals, if required by other countries, may be longer than that required for FDA clearances or approvals, and requirements for such clearances or approvals may significantly differ from FDA requirements. In certain countries we may rely upon third-party or third-party distributors to obtain all required regulatory clearances or approvals, and these distributors may be unable to obtain or maintain such clearances or approvals. Our distributors in these countries may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and in maintaining foreign regulatory approvals or qualifications, which could increase the difficulty of attracting and retaining qualified distributors. If these distributors experience delays in receiving necessary qualifications, clearances or approvals to market our devices outside the United States, or if they fail to receive those qualifications, clearances or approvals, we may be unable to market our devices in certain international markets effectively, or at all, which will adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition generally.. 42. Table of Contents. Healthcare policy changes, including recent federal legislation to reform the U.S. healthcare system, may have a material adverse effect on us.. Our operations are impacted by the PPACA. Compliance with the ACA has imposed significant administrative and financial burdens on us. For example, the PPACA imposed, among other things, a 2.3% federal excise tax, with limited exceptions, on any entity that manufactures or imports Class I, II and III medical devices offered for sale in the United States that began on January 1, 2013. Through a series of legislative amendments, the tax was suspended for 2016 through 2019. Absent further legislative action, the device excise tax will be reinstated on medical device sales starting January 1, 2020. The current administration have expressed an intention to repeal the ACA and replace it with alternative reforms. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. The details and timing of any further such actions are unknown at this time.  However, it is possible that these changes could adversely affect our business.. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, came into effect, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare devices and services, which could result in reduced demand for our devices or additional pricing pressures.. We face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the PPACA, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. The impact of those changes on us and potential effect on the medical device industry as a whole is currently unknown. But, any changes to the PPACA are likely to have an impact on our results of operations, and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the United States may have on our business.. Risks Related to our Common Stock. We expect that the price of our common stock will fluctuate substantially.. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially in response to, among other things, the risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10 - K and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvariance in our financial performance from the financial projects we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in analysts' estimates, investors' perceptions, recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analysts' estimates;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements of significant new devices or device enhancements by us or our competitors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactual or anticipated quarterly variations in our or our competitors' results of operations;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in the medical device industry in particular;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;. 43. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlegislation or regulatory policies, practices or actions affecting our business;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlawsuits threatened or filed against us;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe sale of our common stock or other securities in the future by us or our stockholders, including upon expiration of market standoff or contractual lock-up agreements;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements related to patents issued to us or our competitors and to litigation;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trecruitment or departure of key personnel, including changes in our board of directors and management;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in market valuation or earnings of our competitors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe trading volume of our common stock;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral market conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelopments in our industry.. In addition, the market prices of the stock of many new issuers in the medical device industry and of other companies with smaller market capitalizations like us have been volatile and from time to time have experienced significant share price and trading volume changes unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. As a result, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. Any securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, reputation and cash flows. See Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\" and Note 7, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. These factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.. A substantial number of additional shares may be sold into the public market in the near future, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly, even if our business is doing well.. Sales of a substantial amount of common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we have 17,179,258 shares of common stock outstanding. This includes the 4,600,000 shares of our common stock we sold in our IPO in June 2015 and 3,220,000 shares of our common stock we sold in a secondary offering in August 2016, which may be resold in the public market immediately. In July 2016, in order to facilitate the raising of additional funds, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S - 3 (Registration No. 333 - 212395) that allows us to sell up to an aggregate of $100,000,000 of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depository shares and/or units. The shares we sold in a secondary offering in August 2016 were sold pursuant to this shelf registration and a prospectus supplement.. A significant portion of the holders of our common stock and warrants have the right, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or our stockholders pursuant to a stockholders agreement between such holders and us. If such holders, by exercising their registration rights, sell a large number of shares, they could adversely affect the market price for our common stock. If we file a registration statement for the purpose of selling additional shares to raise capital and are required to include shares held by these holders pursuant to the exercise of their registration rights, our ability to raise capital may be impaired. These registration rights terminate in June 2022.. We filed a registration statement under the Securities Act to register all shares subject to options outstanding or reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans. Our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan provides for annual automatic increases in the shares reserved for issuance under the plan without stockholder approval, which would result in. 44. Table of Contents. additional dilution to our stockholders. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance and vesting, subject to any applicable lock-up period or other restrictions provided under the terms of the applicable plan and/or the option agreements entered into with option holders.. Our directors, officers and principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders.. As of December 31, 2017, our directors and executive officers and stockholders holding more than 5% of our capital stock, and their affiliates, own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock. To the extent our existing stockholders purchase additional shares, this ownership concentration would increase. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would exercise significant influence over most matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets. This concentration of ownership could limit your ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us.. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue a negative opinion regarding our common stock, the price of our common stock and trading volume could decline.. The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research reports and opinions that securities or industry analysts publish about our business, our market and our competitors. We are pioneering the use of our technology in minimal access surgery and thus, analysts may be less likely to publish reports and opinions about our industry. Therefore, we may be required to educate analysts on the nature of our industry in order to obtain research coverage, and such efforts may not be successful. We do not have any control over these analysts. Investors have numerous investment opportunities and may limit their investments to publicly traded companies that receive thorough research coverage. If one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our shares, cease to cover us or fail to publish reports in a regular manner, our share price would likely decline, or we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause a significant and prolonged decline in our stock price due to lack of investor awareness.. The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management's attention and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members.. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market and other applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. Despite recent reforms made possible by the JOBS Act, compliance with these laws, rules and regulations will nonetheless increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly after we are no longer an \"emerging growth company.\" The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management's attention may be diverted from other business concerns and our costs and expenses will increase, which could harm our business and operating results. We may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which will increase our costs and expenses.. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.. 45. Table of Contents. We incur substantial compensation costs as we pay our executive officers cash compensation commensurate with that of executive officers of other similarly sized public medical device companies, which increases our general and administrative expense and could harm our profitability. Any future equity awards will also increase our compensation expense. We also expect that being a public company and compliance with applicable rules and regulations increases the cost of director and officer liability insurance, and, to the extent our risk profile changes, we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee.. As disclosure of information in filings required increases in a public company, our business and financial condition has become more visible, which could be advantageous to our competitors and clients and could result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be harmed, and even if the claims are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and harm our business, brand, reputation and operating results.. We are an \"emerging growth company\" and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.. We are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take, and intend to take, advantage of certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \"emerging growth companies.\" In particular, while we are an \"emerging growth company\" (1) we will not be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) we will be exempt from any rules that could be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotations or a supplement to the auditor's report on financial statements, (3) we will be subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and (4) we will not be required to hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.. We may remain an \"emerging growth company\" until as late as December 31, 2020, the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, though we may cease to be an \"emerging growth company\" earlier under certain circumstances, including if (1) we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue in any fiscal year, (2) the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (3) we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.. The exact implications of the JOBS Act are still subject to interpretations and guidance by the SEC and other regulatory agencies, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to take advantage of all of the benefits of the JOBS Act. In addition, investors may find our common stock less attractive to the extent we rely on the exemptions and relief granted by the JOBS Act. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may decline or become more volatile.. In the event that our internal control over financial reporting is perceived as inadequate, or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results and the trading price of our common stock could decline.. We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. As a result, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As a public company, we are required, under Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We designed our disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.. 46. Table of Contents. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur in the future and not be detected.. In addition, once we cease to be an emerging growth company under the federal securities laws, our auditors will be required to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. While we may remain an \"emerging growth company\" until as late as December 31, 2020, the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, we may cease to be an \"emerging growth company\" earlier under certain circumstances and that could accelerate our timeline for complying with Section 404(b).. If we are unable to confirm that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our auditors, when required, are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, or be delayed in producing these financial reports, both of which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. We could also be subject to, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Market and could be subject to securities litigation.. Anti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could discourage a takeover and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove current management.. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that might discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or change of control, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions include:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta classified board of directors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadvance notice requirements applicable to stockholders for matters to be brought before a meeting of stockholders and requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder's notice;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta supermajority stockholder vote requirement for amending certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tallowing stockholders to remove directors only for cause and only with a supermajority stockholder vote;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta requirement that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tallowing all vacancies, including newly created directorships, to be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, except as otherwise required by law;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta requirement that our stockholders may only take action at annual or special meetings of our stockholders and not by written consent; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimiting the persons that can call special meetings of our stockholders to our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, the chief executive officer or the president (in the absence of a chief executive officer).. These provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or a change in our management. The existence of these provisions could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. In addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation. 47. Table of Contents. from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \"interested\" stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \"interested\" stockholder.. Our issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of our common stock.. Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our board is authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders. Our board also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, except that shares of preferred stock may not have more than one vote per share, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. In the event that we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock that is convertible into our common stock at greater than a one-to-one ratio, the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.. We have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future on our common stock, and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.. We have never paid cash dividends and we currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We are not legally or contractually required to pay dividends and the credit agreements with MidCap contain restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends The declaration and payment of all future dividends, if any, will be at the sole discretion our board of directors, which retains the right to change our dividend policy at any time, and may be limited by our debt arrangements in place from time to time. The payment of dividends will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, to realize any future gains on their investment."
