[1] "Item 1A.  Risk Factors.. <U+FEFF>. We operate in an industry that has numerous risks, many of which are beyond our control or are driven by factors that cannot always be predicted. Investors should carefully consider all of the risk factors in conjunction with the other information included in this report as our financial results and condition or market value could be adversely affected if any of these risks were to occur.. <U+FEFF>. Risks Related to our Business and Industry. <U+FEFF>. Our profitability is dependent on managing the spread between the price of corn, natural gas, ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil, cattle and vinegar.. <U+FEFF>. Our operating results are highly sensitive to commodity prices, including the spread between the corn, natural gas, cattle and ethanol we purchase, and the ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil and vinegar we sell. Price and supply are subject to various market forces, such as weather, domestic and global demand, shortages, export prices, crude oil prices, currency valuations and government policies in the United States and around the world, over which we have no control. Price volatility of these commodities may cause our operating results to fluctuate substantially. Increases in corn or natural gas prices or decreases in ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil prices may make it unprofitable to operate our ethanol plants. No assurance can be given that we will purchase corn and natural gas or sell ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil and cattle at or near current prices. Consequently, our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected by increases in corn or natural gas prices or decreases in ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil and cattle prices.. <U+FEFF>. We continuously monitor the profitability of our ethanol plants and cattle feeding operations using a variety of risk management tools and hedging strategies, when appropriate. In recent years, the spread between ethanol and corn prices has fluctuated widely and narrowed significantly. Fluctuations are likely to continue. A sustained narrow spread or further reduction in the spread between ethanol and corn prices as a result of increased corn prices or decreased ethanol prices, would adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Should our combined revenue from ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil fall below our cost of production, we could decide to slow or suspend production at some or all of our ethanol plants.. <U+FEFF>. The commodities we buy and sell are subject to price volatility and uncertainty.. <U+FEFF>. Corn.  We are generally unable to pass increased corn costs to our customers since ethanol competes with other fuels. At certain corn prices, ethanol may be uneconomical to produce. Ethanol plants, livestock industries and other corn-consuming enterprises put significant price pressure on local corn markets. In addition, local corn supplies and prices could be adversely affected by prices for alternative crops, increasing input costs, changes in government policies, shifts in global markets or damaging growing conditions, such as plant disease or adverse weather, including drought.. <U+FEFF>. Natural Gas.  The price and availability of natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions are often affected by factors beyond our control, such as weather, drilling economics, overall economic conditions and government regulations. Significant disruptions in natural gas supply could impair our ability to produce ethanol. Furthermore, increases in natural gas price or changes in our cost relative to our competitors cannot be passed on to our customers which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.. <U+FEFF>. Ethanol.  Our revenues are dependent on market prices for ethanol which can be volatile as a result of a number of factors, including: the price and availability of competing fuels; the overall supply and demand for ethanol and corn; the price of gasoline, crude oil and corn; and government policies.. <U+FEFF>. Ethanol is marketed as a fuel additive that reduces vehicle emissions, an economical source of octanes and, to a lesser. 13. extent, a gasoline substitute. Consequently, gasoline supply and demand affect the price of ethanol. Should gasoline prices or demand decrease significantly, our results of operations could be materially harmed.. <U+FEFF>. Ethanol imports also affect domestic supply and demand. Imported ethanol is not subject to an import tariff and, under RFS II, sugarcane ethanol from Brazil is one of the most economical means for obligated parties to meet the advanced biofuel standard.. <U+FEFF>. Distillers Grains.  Increased U.S. dry mill ethanol production has resulted in increased distillers grains production. Should this trend continue, distillers grains prices could fall unless demand increases or other market sources are found. The price of distillers grains has historically been correlated with the price of corn. Occasionally, the price of distillers grains will lag behind fluctuations in corn or other feedstock prices, lowering our cost recovery percentage.  Additionally, exports of distiller grains could be impacted by the enactment of foreign policy.. <U+FEFF>. Distillers grains compete with other protein-based animal feed products. Downward pressure on commodity prices, such as soybeans, will generally cause the price of competing animal feed products to decline, resulting in downward pressure on the price of distillers grains.. <U+FEFF>. Corn Oil.  Industrial corn oil is generally marketed as a biodiesel feedstock; therefore, the price of corn oil is affected by demand for biodiesel. In general, corn oil prices follow the prices of heating oil and soybean oil. Decreases in the price of corn oil could have an unfavorable impact on our business.. <U+FEFF>. Cattle. The price and availability of feeder cattle are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions are often affected by factors beyond our control, such as weather, overall economic conditions and government regulations. Significant disruptions in feeder cattle supply could impair our ability to produce consistent results. Furthermore, increases in spreads between feeder and live cattle futures or changes in our cost relative to our competitors may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. In addition, a significant disruption in cattle processing capacity could impair our ability to market cattle at favorable prices which would affect our profitability.. <U+FEFF>. Our risk management strategies could be ineffective and expose us to decreased liquidity.. <U+FEFF>. As market conditions warrant, we use forward contracts to sell some of our ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil, cattle and vinegar production or buy some of the corn, natural gas, cattle or ethanol we need to partially offset commodity price volatility. We also engage in other hedging transactions involving exchange-traded futures contracts for corn, natural gas, cattle and ethanol. The financial impact of these activities depends on the price of the commodities involved and our ability to physically receive or deliver the commodities.. <U+FEFF>. Hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss when the counterparty defaults on its contract or, in the case of exchange-traded contracts, when the expected differential between the price of the underlying and physical commodity changes. Hedging activities can result in losses when a position is purchased in a declining market or sold in a rising market. Hedging losses may be offset by a decreased cash price for corn and natural gas and an increased cash price for ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. We vary the amount of hedging and other risk mitigation strategies we undertake and sometimes choose not to engage in hedging transactions at all. We cannot provide assurance that our risk management strategies and decisions effectively offset commodity price volatility. If we fail to offset such volatility, our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. The use of derivative financial instruments frequently involves cash deposits with brokers, or margin calls. Sudden changes in commodity prices may require additional cash deposits immediately. Depending on our open derivative positions, we may need additional liquidity with little advance notice to cover margin calls. While we continuously monitor our exposure to margin calls, we cannot guarantee we will be able to maintain adequate liquidity to cover margin calls in the future.. <U+FEFF>. Government mandates affecting ethanol could change and impact the ethanol market.. <U+FEFF>. Under the provisions of the EISA, Congress established a mandate setting the minimum volume of renewable fuels that must be blended with gasoline under the RFS II, which affects the domestic market for ethanol. The EPA has the authority to waive the requirements, in whole or in part, if there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or the requirement severely harms the economy or the environment. After 2022, volumes shall be determined by the EPA in coordination with the Secretaries of Energy and Agriculture, taking into account such factors as impact on environment, energy security, future rates of production, cost to consumers, infrastructure, and other factors such as impact on commodity prices, job creation,. 14. rural economic development, or impact on food prices.. <U+FEFF>. Our operations could be adversely impacted by legislation or EPA actions, as set forth below or otherwise, that may reduce the RFS II mandate. Similarly, should federal mandates regarding oxygenated gasoline be repealed, the market for domestic ethanol could be adversely impacted. Economic incentives to blend based on the relative value of gasoline versus ethanol, taking into consideration the octane value of ethanol, environmental requirements and the RFS II mandate, may affect future demand. A significant increase in supply beyond the RFS II mandate could have an adverse impact on ethanol prices. Moreover, changes to RFS II could negatively impact the price of ethanol or cause imported sugarcane ethanol to become more economical than domestic ethanol.. <U+FEFF>. On July 5, 2017, the EPA proposed maintaining the RVOs for conventional ethanol at 15.0 billion gallons while lowering the volume obligations for advanced alternatives, reducing the overall biofuel target to 19.24 billion gallons for 2018. On September 26, 2017, the EPA issued a Notice of Data Availability for comment, proposing to further reduce the 2018 advanced biofuel volume requirement by 315 mmg, to 3.77 billion gallons, and the total renewable fuel requirement to 18.77 billion gallons, leaving conventional ethanol at 15.0 billion gallons. According to RFS II, if mandatory renewable fuel volumes are reduced by at least 20% for two consecutive years, the EPA is required to modify, or reset, statutory volumes through 2022. While conventional ethanol maintained 15 billion gallons, 2018 is the first year the total proposed RVOs are more than 20% below statutory volumes levels.  Thus, the EPA Administrator directed his staff to initiate the required technical analysis to perform any future reset consistent with the reset rules. The reset will be triggered if the 2019 RVOs continue to be more than 20% below the statutory levels, and the EPA will be required to modify statutory volumes through 2022 within one year of the trigger event, based on the same factors used to set the RVOs post-2022.. <U+FEFF>. The U.S. Federal District Court for the D.C. Circuit ruled on July 28, 2017, in favor of the Americans for Clean Energy and its petitioners against the EPA related to its decision to lower the 2016 volume requirements. The Court concluded the EPA erred in how it interpreted the \"inadequate domestic supply\" waiver provision of RFS II, which authorizes the EPA to consider supply-side factors affecting the volume of renewable fuel available to refiners, blenders, and importers to meet the statutory volume requirements. The waiver provision does not allow the EPA to consider the volume of renewable fuel available to consumers or the demand-side constraints that affect the consumption of renewable fuel by consumers. As a result, the Court vacated the EPA's decision to reduce the total renewable fuel volume requirements for 2016 through its waiver authority, which the EPA is expected to address. We believe this decision will benefit the industry overall, with the EPA's waiver analysis now limited to supply considerations only, and expect the primary impact will be on the RINs market.. <U+FEFF>. On October 19, 2017, the EPA Administrator reiterated his commitment to the text and spirit of the RFS II. In a letter to seven Senators from the Midwestern states, among other topics, he stated the EPA is actively exploring its authority to issue an RVP waiver and will not be pursuing action on RINs involving ethanol exports. Moreover, on November 22, 2017, the EPA issued a Notice of Denial of Petitions for rulemaking to change the RFS point of obligation which resulted in the EPA confirming the point of obligation will not change.. <U+FEFF>. Valero Energy and refining trade group American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) have challenged the EPA's handling of the U.S. biofuel mandate in separate actions on January 26, 2018. AFPM is asking the D.C. U.S. Court of Appeals to review the EPA's November 2017 decision to reject proposed changes to the structure of the RFS, including moving the point of obligation from refiners and importers of fuel to fuel blenders. Valero filed two petitions with the same court, one seeking review of the annual Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) rule set by EPA's for 2018 and 2019, which dictates the volumes of renewable fuels to be blended in the coming years, and a second arguing against the EPA's December 2017 assertion that the agency has fulfilled its duty to periodically review the RFS as directed by statute.. <U+FEFF>. Future demand may be influenced by economic incentives to blend based on the relative value of gasoline versus ethanol, taking into consideration the octane value of ethanol, environmental requirements and the RFS II mandate. A significant increase in supply beyond the RFS II mandate could have an adverse impact on ethanol prices. Moreover, any changes to RFS II originating from issues associated with the market price of RINs could negatively impact the demand for ethanol, discretionary blending of ethanol and/or the price of ethanol.. <U+FEFF>. Flexible-fuel vehicles, which are designed to run on a mixture of fuels such as E85, receive preferential treatment to meet corporate average fuel economy standards in the form of CAFE credits. Flexible-fuel vehicle credits have been decreasing since 2014 and will be completely phased out by 2020. Absent CAFE preferences, auto manufacturers may not be willing to build flexible-fuel vehicles, reducing the growth of E85 markets and resulting in lower ethanol prices.. <U+FEFF>. To the extent federal or state laws or regulations are modified, the demand for ethanol may be reduced, which could negatively and materially affect our ability to operate profitably.. 15. <U+FEFF>. If the United States were to withdraw from or materially modify NAFTA or certain other international trade agreements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.. Ethanol and other products that we produce are sold into Canada, Mexico and other countries with trade agreements with the United States. The current administration has expressed antipathy towards certain existing international trade agreements, including NAFTA, and made comments suggesting that they support significantly increasing tariffs on goods imported into the United States, which in turn may lead to retaliatory actions on US exports. As of the date of this Form 10-K, it remains unclear what the outcomes may be of NAFTA trade regulations, other international trade agreements and tariffs on various goods imported into the United States. If the United States were to withdraw from or materially modify NAFTA or other international trade agreements to which it is a party, or if tariffs were raised on the foreign-sourced goods that lead to retaliatory actions, it could have material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Future demand for ethanol is uncertain and changes in public perception, consumer acceptance and overall consumer demand for transportation fuel could affect demand.. <U+FEFF>. While many trade groups, academics and government agencies support ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment, others claim ethanol production consumes considerably more energy, emits more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and depletes water resources. Some studies suggest ethanol produced from corn is less efficient than ethanol produced from switch grass or wheat grain. Others claim corn-based ethanol negatively impacts consumers by causing the prices of dairy, meat and other food derived from corn-consuming livestock to increase. Ethanol critics also contend the industry redirects corn supplies from international food markets to domestic fuel markets.. <U+FEFF>. There are limited markets for ethanol beyond the federal mandates. Further consumer acceptance of E15 and E85 fuels may be necessary before ethanol can achieve significant market share growth. Discretionary and E85 blending are important secondary markets. Discretionary blending is often determined by the price of ethanol relative to gasoline. When discretionary blending is financially unattractive, the demand for ethanol may be reduced.. <U+FEFF>. Demand for ethanol is also affected by overall demand for transportation fuel, which is affected by cost, number of miles traveled and vehicle fuel economy. Consumer demand for gasoline may be impacted by emerging transportation trends, such as electric vehicles or ride sharing. Additionally, factors such as over-supply of product could negatively impact demand for ethanol. Reduced demand for ethanol may depress the value of our products, erode our margins, and reduce our ability to generate revenue or operate profitably.. <U+FEFF>. Our business is directly affected by the supply and demand for ethanol and other fuels in the markets served by our assets. Miles traveled typically increases during the spring and summer months related to vacation travel, followed closely behind the fall season due to holiday travel. Additionally, reduced demand for ethanol may erode our margins and reduce our ability to generate revenue and operate profitably.. <U+FEFF>. We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures or partnerships.. <U+FEFF>. We have increased the size and diversity of our operations significantly through mergers and acquisitions and intend to continue exploring potential growth opportunities. Acquisitions involve numerous risks that could harm our business, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties integrating the operations, technologies, products, existing contracts, accounting processes and personnel and realizing anticipated synergies of the combined business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trisks relating to environmental hazards on purchased sites;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trisks relating to developing the necessary infrastructure for facilities or acquired sites, including access to rail networks;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties supporting and transitioning customers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe purchase price exceeding the value realized;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trisks of entering new markets or areas outside of our core competencies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential loss of key employees, customers and strategic alliances from our existing or acquired business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunanticipated problems or underlying liabilities; and. 16.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition and development costs.. <U+FEFF>. The anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be fully realized or take longer to realize than expected.. <U+FEFF>. We may also pursue growth through joint ventures or partnerships, which typically involve restrictions on actions that the partnership or joint venture may take without the approval of the partners. These provisions could limit our ability to manage the partnership or joint venture in a manner that serves our best interests.. <U+FEFF>. Future acquisitions may involve issuing equity as payment or to finance the business or assets, which could dilute your ownership interest. Furthermore, additional debt may be necessary to complete these transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Failure to adequately address the risks associated with acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. Our debt exposes us to numerous risks that could have significant consequences to our shareholders.. <U+FEFF>. Risks related to the level of debt we have include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequiring a substantial portion of cash to be dedicated for debt service, reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures, and other general business activities and limiting our ability to invest in new growth opportunities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other activities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimiting our flexibility to plan for or react to changes in the businesses and industries in which we operate;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreasing our vulnerability to general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbeing at a competitive disadvantage against less leveraged competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbeing vulnerable to increases in prevailing interest rates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsubjecting all or substantially all of our assets to liens, which means there may be no assets left for shareholders in the event of a liquidation; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimiting our ability to make operational decisions regarding our business, including limiting our ability to pay dividends, make capital improvements, sell or purchase assets or engage in transactions deemed appropriate and in our best interest.. <U+FEFF>. Most of our debt bears interest at variable rates, which creates exposure to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations at variable rates would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, decreasing net income.. <U+FEFF>. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest, to make additional payments required under financial covenants, or to refinance our debt depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue generating cash flow sufficient to service our debt. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows, we may be required to sell assets, restructure debt or obtain additional equity capital on terms that are onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our debt will depend on capital markets and our financial condition at that time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in default on our debt obligations.. <U+FEFF>. We are required to comply with a number of covenants under our existing loan agreements that could hinder our growth.. <U+FEFF>. The loan agreements governing our secured debt financing and our convertible senior notes contain a number of restrictive affirmative and negative covenants, which limit our ability to incur additional debt; exceed certain limits; pay dividends or distributions; or merge, consolidate or dispose of substantially all of our assets.. <U+FEFF>. We are required to maintain specified financial ratios, including minimum cash flow coverage, term debt to term total capitalization, working capital and tangible net worth under certain loan agreements. Other agreements require us to use a portion of excess cash flow generated by our operations to prepay the respective term debt. A breach of these covenants could result in default, and if such default is not cured or waived, our lenders could accelerate our debt and declare it immediately due and payable. If this occurs, we may not be able to repay or borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt. Even if financing is available, it may not be on acceptable terms. No assurance can be given that our future operating results will be. 17. sufficient to comply with these covenants or remedy default. We also have an incurrence test that may limit our ability to make certain restricted equity or debt payments, make acquisitions or investments and take on additional debt.. <U+FEFF>. In the past, we have received waivers from our lenders for failure to meet certain financial covenants and amended our loan agreements to change these covenants. In the event we are unable to comply with these covenants in the future, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary waivers or amend our loan agreements to prevent default. Under our convertible senior notes, default on any loan in excess of $10.0 million could result in the notes being declared due and payable, which would have a material and adverse effect on our ability to operate.. <U+FEFF>. We operate in a capital intensive business and rely on cash generated from operations and external financing, which could be limited.. <U+FEFF>. Some ethanol producers have faced financial distress, culminating to bankruptcy filings by several companies over the past seven years. This, combined with capital market volatility, has resulted in reduced available capital for the ethanol industry in general. Increased commodity prices could increase liquidity requirements. Our operating cash flow is dependent on overall commodity market conditions as well as our ability to operate profitably. In addition, we may need to raise additional financing to fund growth. In some market environments, we may have limited access to incremental financing, which could defer or cancel growth projects, reduce business activity or cause us to default on our existing debt agreements if we are unable to meet our payment schedules. These events could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial position.. <U+FEFF>. Our ability to repay current and anticipated future debt will depend on our financial and operating performance and successful implementation of our business strategies. Our financial and operational performance will depend on numerous factors including prevailing economic conditions, commodity prices, and financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If we cannot repay, refinance or extend our current debt at scheduled maturity dates, we could be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, restructure our debt or seek additional capital. If we are unable to restructure our debt or raise funds, our operations and growth plans could be harmed and the value of our stock could be significantly reduced.. <U+FEFF>. Disruptions in the credit market or a downgrade in our credit rating could limit our access to capital.. <U+FEFF>. We may need additional capital to fund our growth or other business activities in the future. If our credit rating is downgraded, the cost of capital under our existing or future financing arrangements could increase and affect our ability to trade with various commercial counterparties or cause our counterparties to require additional forms of credit support. If capital markets are disrupted, we may not be able to access capital at all or capital may only be available under less favorable terms.. <U+FEFF>. Our ability to maintain the required regulatory permits or manage changes in environmental, safety and TTB regulations is essential to successfully operating our plants.. <U+FEFF>. Our plants are subject to extensive air, water,  environmental and TTB regulations. Our production facilities involve the emission of various airborne pollutants, including particulate, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, hazardous air pollutants and volatile organic compounds, which requires numerous environmental permits to operate our plants. Governing state agencies could impose costly conditions or restrictions that are detrimental to our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.. <U+FEFF>. Environmental laws and regulations at the federal and state level are subject to change.  These changes can also be made retroactively. It is possible that more stringent federal or state environmental rules or regulations could be adopted, which could increase our operating costs and expenses. Consequently, even though we currently have the proper permits, we may be required to invest or spend considerable resources in order to comply with future environmental regulations. Furthermore, ongoing plant operations, which are governed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, may change in a way that increases the cost of plant operations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.. <U+FEFF>. Part of our business is regulated by environmental laws and regulations governing the labeling, use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials. Since we handle and use hazardous substances, changes in environmental requirements or an unanticipated significant adverse environmental event could have a negative impact on our business. While we strive to comply with all environmental requirements, we cannot provide assurance that we have been in compliance at all times or will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with these requirements. Private parties, including current and former employees, could bring personal injury or other claims against us due to the presence of hazardous substances. We are also exposed to residual risk by our land and facilities which may have environmental liabilities from prior use. Changes in. 18. environmental regulations may require us to modify existing plant and processing facilities, which could significantly increase our cost of operations.. <U+FEFF>. TTB regulations apply when producing our undenatured ethanol.  These regulations carry substantial penalties for non-compliance and therefore any non-compliance may adversely affect our financial operations or adversely impact our ability to produce undenatured ethanol.. <U+FEFF>. Any inability to generate or obtain RINs could adversely affect our operating margins.. <U+FEFF>. Nearly all of our ethanol production is sold with RINs that are used by our customers to comply with the Renewable Fuel Standard. Should our production not meet the EPA's requirements for RIN generation in the future, we would need to purchase RINs in the open market or sell our ethanol at lower prices to compensate for the absence of RINs. The price of RINs depends on a variety of factors, including the availability of qualifying biofuels and RINs for purchase, production levels of transportation fuel and percentage mix of ethanol with other fuels, and cannot be predicted. Failure to obtain sufficient RINs or reliance on invalid RINs could subject us to fines and penalties imposed by the EPA which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. We trade ethanol acquired from third-parties. Should it be discovered the RINs associated with the ethanol we purchased are invalid, albeit unknowingly, we could be subject to substantial penalties if we are assessed the maximum amount allowed by law. Prior to 2013, the EPA assessed only modest penalties for RIN violations. However, based on EPA penalties assessed on RINS violations in the past few years, in the event of a violation, the EPA could assess penalties, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability.. <U+FEFF>. Compliance with evolving environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, particularly those related to climate change, could be costly.. <U+FEFF>. Our plants emit carbon dioxide as a by-product of ethanol production. In February 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on RFS II, grandfathering our plants at their current authorized capacity.  While some of our plants have received efficient producer status and no longer rely on grandfathered status, for those still reliant upon it, expansion above these levels will require a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the 2005 baseline measurement. Separately, CARB adopted a LCFS that took effect in January 2013, which requires a 10% reduction in the average carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel transportation fuels from 2010 to 2020. An ILUC component is included in the greenhouse gas emission calculation, which may have an adverse impact on the market for corn-based ethanol in California.. <U+FEFF>. To expand our production capacity, federal and state regulations may require us to obtain additional permits, achieve EPA's efficient producer status under the pathway petition program, install advanced technology or reduce drying distillers grains. Compliance with future laws or regulations to decrease carbon dioxide could be costly and may prevent us from operating our plants as profitably, which may have an adverse impact on our operations, cash flows and financial position.. <U+FEFF>. Global competition could affect our profitability.. We compete with producers in the United States and abroad. Depending on feedstock, labor and other production costs, producers in other countries, such as Brazil, may be able to produce ethanol cheaper than we can. Under RFS II, certain parties are obligated to meet an advanced biofuel standard. In recent years, sugarcane ethanol imported from Brazil has been one of the most economical means for obligated parties to meet this standard. While transportation costs, infrastructure constraints and demand may temper the impact of ethanol imports, foreign competition remains a risk to our business. Moreover, significant additional foreign ethanol production could create excess supply, which could result in lower ethanol prices throughout the world, including the United States. Any penetration of ethanol imports into the domestic market may have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.. <U+FEFF>. International activities such as boycotts, embargoes, product rejection, trade policies and compliance matters, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Government actions abroad can have a significant impact on our business. In 2017, we exported 13.5% of our ethanol production and 9% of our distillers grains production. In 2013, the EU imposed a five-year tariff of $83.33 per metric ton on U.S. ethanol to discourage foreign competition. Effective January 1, 2017, China indicated its intention to raise its 5% tariff on U.S. and Brazil fuel ethanol to 30%. Although the ethanol export markets are affected by competition from other ethanol exporters, particularly Brazil, and in spite of the actions by China, we believe exports will remain active in 2018. On September 1, 2017, Brazil's Chamber of Foreign Trade, or CAMEX, issued an official written resolution, imposing a 20% tariff on U.S. ethanol imports in excess of 150 million liters, or 39.6 million gallons per quarter. The ruling is valid for two. 19. years.. <U+FEFF>. In 2013, China began rejecting U.S. dried distillers grains because it contained genetically modified corn not yet approved for import. In early 2015, China lifted this ban and imported 6.3 million metric tons of U.S. distillers grains that year. In January 2016, China's Ministry of Commerce once again initiated an anti-dumping investigation into U.S.-produced dried distillers grains exported to China. In January of 2017, the Ministry of Commerce of China announced it increased anti-dumping duties on U.S. distillers grains, ranging from 42.2% to 53.7%. According to the USDA, in 2017, approximately 29% of distillers grain produced in the United States was exported, down from 31% in 2016.. <U+FEFF>. With more tariffs and reduced exports, the value of our distillers grains may be affected, which could have a negative impact on our profitability. Additionally, tariffs on U.S. ethanol may lead to further industry over-supply and reduce our profitability. Moreover, the America First trade position has caused more countries to toughen their positions on U.S. imports.. <U+FEFF>. Increased ethanol industry penetration by oil and other multinational companies could impact our margins.. <U+FEFF>. We operate in a very competitive environment and compete with other domestic ethanol producers in a relatively fragmented industry. The top five producers account for approximately 44% of the domestic production capacity with production capacity ranging from 800 mmgy to 1,700 mmgy. The remaining ethanol producers consist of smaller entities engaged exclusively in ethanol production and large integrated grain companies that produce ethanol in addition to their base grain businesses. We compete for capital, labor, corn and other resources with these companies.. <U+FEFF>. Until recently, oil companies, petrochemical refiners and gasoline retailers were not engaged in ethanol production even though they form the primary distribution network for ethanol blended with gasoline. During the past five years, several oil refiners have acquired ethanol production plants. If these companies increase their ethanol plant ownership or additional companies commence production, the need to purchase ethanol from independent producers like us could diminish and adversely effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.. <U+FEFF>. Sales of distillers grains depend on its continued market acceptance as livestock feed.. <U+FEFF>. Antibiotics may be used during the fermentation process to control bacterial contamination; therefore, it is possible for antibiotics to be present in small quantities in our distillers grains, which is a co-product of the fermentation process and marketed as an animal feed. Should the FDA introduce regulations limiting the sale of such distillers grains in domestic or international markets, the market value of our distillers grains could be diminished, which would negatively impact our profitability.. <U+FEFF>. Independently, if public perception regarding distillers grains as an acceptable animal feed were to change or if the public became concerned about the impact of distillers grains in the food supply, the market for distillers grains could be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our profitability.. <U+FEFF>. We extract industrial grade corn oil from the whole stillage process before producing distillers grains. Several universities are trying to determine how corn oil extraction affects nutritional energy values of the resulting distillers grains. If it is determined that corn oil extraction adversely affects the digestible energy content of distillers grains, the value of our distillers grains may be affected, which could have a negative impact on our profitability.. <U+FEFF>. Our agribusiness operations are subject to significant government regulations.. <U+FEFF>. Our agribusiness operations are regulated by various government entities that can impose significant costs on our business. Failure to comply could result in additional expenditures, fines or criminal action. Our production levels, markets and grains we merchandise are affected by federal government programs, which include USDA acreage control and price support programs. Government policies such as tariffs, duties, subsidies, import and export restrictions and embargos can also impact our business. Changes in government policies and producer support could impact the type and amount of grains planted, which could affect our ability to buy grain. Export restrictions or tariffs could limit sales opportunities outside of the United States.. <U+FEFF>. Commodities futures trading is subject to extensive regulations.. <U+FEFF>. The futures industry is subject to extensive regulation. Since we use exchange-traded futures contracts as part of our business, we are required to comply with a wide range of requirements imposed by the CFTC, National Futures Association and the exchanges on which we trade. These regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the futures. 20. markets and protecting the interests of market participants. As a market participant, we are subject to regulation concerning trade practices, business conduct, reporting, position limits, record retention, the conduct of our officers and employees, and other matters.. <U+FEFF>. Failure to comply with the laws, rules or regulations applicable to futures trading could have adverse consequences. Such claims could result in fines, settlements or suspended trading privileges, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.. <U+FEFF>. Owning and operating cattle feeding operations involves numerous external factors that are outside of our control.. <U+FEFF>. Our cattle feeding operations involve numerous risks that could lead to increased costs or decreased demand for beef products, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconstantly changing and potentially volatile supply and demand, which affect the cost of livestock and feed ingredients and the sales price of our cattle;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toutbreak of disease in our or other cattle feeding operations or public perception that an outbreak has occurred, which could lead to inadequate supply, reduced consumer confidence in the safety and quality of beef products, adverse publicity, cancellation of orders and import or export restrictions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tliabilities in excess of our insurance policy limits or related uninsurable risks if outbreaks of disease or other conditions result in significant losses;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\textended periods of bad weather, including the combination of cold temperatures and precipitation, as well as blizzards or tornados;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiminished access to international markets, including import trade restrictions due to disease or other perceived health or food safety issues, or changes in political or economic conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduced red meat consumption due to dietary changes or other issues, leading to depressed cattle prices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe closure or extended shutdown of a major cattle packing plant, leading to depressed cattle prices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased water costs due to water use restrictions, including those related to diminishing water table levels;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toperational restrictions resulting from government regulations; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trisks relating to environmental hazards.. <U+FEFF>. Owning and operating a vinegar production business involves numerous external factors that are outside of our control.. <U+FEFF>. Our Fleischmann's Vinegar operations involve numerous risks that could lead to increased costs or decreased demand for products, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe use many different products in the production of vinegar, which are subject to price volatility caused by market fluctuations, and potentially volatile supply and demand. Commodity price increases may increase raw material, packaging, energy and operating costs. We may not be able to increase our product prices to fully offset these increased costs, which may result in reduced sales volume, margins and profitability;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely affect us, as the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales and results of operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to manufacture, transport and sell our products is critical to our success and any disruptions in our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe food ingredients industry is highly competitive and further consolidation in the industry would likely increase competition;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour customers have continued to consolidate, resulting in fewer customers upon which we can rely for business. These consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength, which could have a negative impact on profits;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconsumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our products depends on our ability to identify the tastes of consumers and work with manufacturers to develop products that appeal to those preferences;. 21.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfood ingredients used in products for human consumption may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact our profitability;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by various federal, state and local government agencies as well as SQF, a Global Food and Safety Initiative program related to processing, packaging, storage, distribution, supply chains, quality and safety of food products, the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment.  Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines, injunctions and recalls of our products; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tA portion of our workforce is unionized and we may face labor disruptions that may interfere with our operations.. <U+FEFF>. Our success depends on our ability to manage our growing and changing operations.. <U+FEFF>. Since our formation in 2004, our business has grown significantly in size, products and complexity. This growth places substantial demands on our management, systems, internal controls, and financial and physical resources. If we acquire additional operations, we may need to further develop our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems, and could incur expenses related to hiring additional qualified personnel and expanding our information technology infrastructure. Our ability to manage growth effectively could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. Replacement technologies could make corn-based ethanol or our process technology obsolete.. <U+FEFF>. Ethanol is used primarily as an octane additive and oxygenate blended with gasoline. Critics of ethanol blends argue that it decreases fuel economy, causes corrosion and damages fuel pumps. Prior to federal restrictions and ethanol mandates, methyl tertiary-butyl ether, or MTBE, was the leading oxygenate. Other ether products could enter the market and prove to be environmentally or economically superior to ethanol. Alternative biofuel alcohols, such as methanol and butanol, could evolve and replace ethanol.. <U+FEFF>. Research is currently underway to develop products and processes that have advantages over ethanol, such as: lower vapor pressure, making it easier to add to gasoline; similar energy content as gasoline, reducing any decrease in fuel economy caused by blending with gasoline; ability to blend at higher concentration levels in standard vehicles; and reduced susceptibility to separation when water is present. Products offering a competitive advantage over ethanol could reduce our ability to generate revenue and profits from ethanol production.. <U+FEFF>. New ethanol process technologies could emerge that require less energy per gallon to produce and result in lower production costs. Our process technologies could become obsolete and place us at a competitive disadvantage, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.. <U+FEFF>. We may be required to provide remedies for ethanol, distillers grains or corn oil that does not meet the specifications defined in our sales contracts.. <U+FEFF>. If we produce or purchase ethanol, distillers grains or corn oil that does not meet the specifications defined in our sales contracts, we may be subject to quality claims. We could be required to refund the purchase price of any non-conforming product or replace the non-conforming product at our expense. Ethanol, distillers grains or corn oil that we purchase or market and subsequently sell to others could result in similar claims if the product does not meet applicable contract specifications, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability.. <U+FEFF>. Business disruptions due to unforeseen operational failures or factors outside of our control could impact our ability to fulfill contractual obligations.. <U+FEFF>. Natural disasters, significant track damage resulting from a train derailment or strikes by our transportation providers could delay shipments of raw materials to our plants or deliveries of ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil, cattle and vinegar to our customers. If we are unable to meet customer demand or contract delivery requirements due to stalled operations caused by business disruptions, we could potentially lose customers.. <U+FEFF>. Adverse weather conditions, such as inadequate or excessive amounts of rain during the growing season, overly wet conditions, an early freeze or snowy weather during harvest could impact the supply of corn that is needed to produce ethanol. Corn stored in an open pile may be damaged by rain or warm weather before the corn is dried, shipped or moved into a storage structure.. <U+FEFF>. 22. Our ethanol-related assets may be at greater risk of terrorist attacks, threats of war or actual war, than other possible targets.. <U+FEFF>. Terrorist attacks in the United States, including threats of war or actual war, may adversely affect our operations. A direct attack on our ethanol production plants, or our partnership's storage facilities, fuel terminals and railcars could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, a terrorist attack could have an adverse impact on ethanol prices. Disruption or significant increases in ethanol prices could result in government-imposed price controls.. <U+FEFF>. Our network infrastructure, enterprise applications and internal technology systems could be damaged or otherwise fail and disrupt business activities.. <U+FEFF>. Our network infrastructure, enterprise applications and internal technology systems are instrumental to the day-to-day operations of our business. Numerous factors outside of our control, including earthquakes, floods, lightning, tornados, fire, power loss, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, physical or electronic vandalism or similar disruptions could result in system failures, interruptions or loss of critical data and prevent us from fulfilling customer orders. We cannot provide assurance that our backup systems are sufficient to mitigate hardware or software failures, which could result in business disruptions that negatively impact our operating results and damage our reputation.. <U+FEFF>. We could be adversely affected by cyber-attacks, data security breaches and significant information technology systems interruptions.. <U+FEFF>. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyber-attacks and data security breaches. To manage the risk associated with potential technology security breaches, we have implemented security measures to protect us against cyber-based attacks and disaster recovery plans for our critical systems. However, our information technology systems and network infrastructure may be subject to unauthorized access or attack at any time and there can be no assurances that our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans are sufficient to prevent a technology systems breach, systems failure, business interruption or loss of sensitive data. The potential impact of any of these incidents, should they occur, could be material and have an adverse impact to our revenues, operating results, financial condition or damage our reputation.. <U+FEFF>. We may not be able to hire and retain qualified personnel to operate our facilities.. <U+FEFF>. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain competent employees. Qualified managers, engineers, merchandisers and other personnel must be hired for each of our locations. If we are unable to hire and retain productive, skilled personnel, we may not be able to maximize production, optimize plant operations or execute our business strategy.. <U+FEFF>. In the past, we have had operating losses and could incur future operating losses.. <U+FEFF>. In the last five years, we incurred operating losses during certain quarters and could incur operating losses in the future that are substantial. Although we have had periods of sustained profitability, we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis, which could impact the market price of our common stock and the value of your investment.. <U+FEFF>. Compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.. <U+FEFF>. We are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties.. <U+FEFF>. Federal, state and local jurisdictions may challenge our tax return positions.. <U+FEFF>. The positions taken in our federal and state tax return filings require significant judgments, use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. Despite management's belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, certain positions may be successfully challenged by federal, state and local jurisdictions.. <U+FEFF>. 23. There have been substantial changes to the Internal Revenue Code, some of which could have an adverse effect on our shareholders.. <U+FEFF>. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 and is effective January 1, 2018 making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.  The U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law and impact our results of operations in the period issued.  Among other provisions, the Act reduces the Federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.  Due to the reduction in the federal tax rate to 21%, the Company revalued its deferred liabilities at the new rate at year-end. The company has not yet evaluated the full impact of the Act as it relates 2018 income, however certain components of the Act, such as the limits on deductibility of interest expense, may negatively impact us.. <U+FEFF>. We are exposed to credit risk that could result in losses or affect our ability to make payments should a counterparty fail to perform according to the terms of our agreement.. <U+FEFF>. We are exposed to credit risk from a variety of customers, including major integrated oil companies, large independent refiners, petroleum wholesalers, cattle packers, food companies and other ethanol plants. We are also exposed to credit risk with major suppliers of petroleum products and agricultural inputs when we make payments for undelivered inventories. Our fixed-price forward contracts are subject to credit risk when prices change significantly prior to delivery. The inability by a third party to pay us for our sales, provide product that was paid for in advance or deliver on a fixed-price contract could result in a loss and adversely impact our liquidity and ability to make our own payments when due.. <U+FEFF>. We have limitations, as a holding company, in our ability to receive distributions from a small number of our subsidiaries.. <U+FEFF>. We conduct most of our operations through our subsidiaries and rely on dividends or intercompany transfers of funds to generate free cash flow. Some of our subsidiaries are currently, or are expected to be, limited in their ability to pay dividends or make distributions under the terms of their financing agreements. Consequently, we cannot fully rely on the cash flow from one subsidiary to satisfy the loan obligations of another subsidiary. As a result, if a subsidiary is unable to satisfy its loan obligations, we may not be able to prevent default by providing additional cash to that subsidiary, even if sufficient cash exists elsewhere within our organization.. <U+FEFF>. Increased federal support of cellulosic ethanol could result in increased competition to corn-based ethanol producers.. <U+FEFF>. Legislation, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and EISA, provides numerous funding opportunities supporting cellulosic ethanol production. In addition, RFS II mandates an increasing level of biofuel production that is not derived from corn. Federal policies suggest a long-term political preference for cellulosic processing using feedstocks such as switch grass, silage, wood chips or other forms of biomass. Cellulosic ethanol may be viewed more favorably since the feedstock is not diverted from food production. In addition, cellulosic ethanol may have a smaller carbon footprint because the feedstock does not require energy-intensive fertilizers or industrial production processes. Several cellulosic ethanol plants are currently under development. While these have had limited success to date, as research and development programs persist, there is risk that cellulosic ethanol could displace corn ethanol.. <U+FEFF>. Any changes in federal mandates from corn-based to cellulosic-based ethanol production may reduce our profitability. Our plants are designed as single-feedstock facilities and would require significant additional investments to convert production to cellulosic ethanol. Furthermore, our plants are strategically located in high-yield, low-cost corn production areas. At present, there is limited supply of alternative feedstocks near our facilities. As a result, the adoption of cellulosic ethanol and its use as the preferred form of ethanol could have a significant adverse impact on our business.. <U+FEFF>. We may not have adequate insurance to cover losses from certain events.. <U+FEFF>. Losses related to risks that are not covered by insurance or available under acceptable terms such as war, riots or terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.. <U+FEFF>. Certain of our ethanol production plants, fuel terminals and vinegar operations are located within recognized seismic and flood zones. We modified our facilities to comply with regional structural requirements for those regions of the country and obtained additional insurance coverage specific to earthquake and flood risks for the applicable plants and fuel terminals. We cannot provide assurance that these facilities would remain in operation should a seismic or flood event occur, which would adversely affect our operations.. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. 24. Risks Related to the Partnership. <U+FEFF>. We depend on the partnership to provide fuel storage and transportation services.. <U+FEFF>. The partnership's operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in the storage and transportation of fuel, including: damages to storage facilities, railcars and surrounding properties caused by floods, fires, severe weather, explosions, natural disasters or acts of terrorism; mechanical or structural failures at the partnership's facilities or at third-party facilities at which its operations are dependent; curtailments of operations relative to severe weather; and other hazards, resulting in severe damage or destruction of the partnership's assets or temporary or permanent shut-down of the partnership's facilities. If the partnership is unable to serve our storage and transportation needs, our ability to operate our business could be adversely impacted, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The inability of the partnership to continue operations, for any reason, could also impact the value of our investment in the partnership and, because the partnership is a consolidated entity, our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. The partnership may not have sufficient available cash to pay quarterly distributions on its units.. <U+FEFF>. The amount of cash the partnership can distribute depends on how much cash is generated from operations, which can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on ethanol and other fuel volumes, handling fees, payments associated with minimum volume commitments, timely payments by subsidiaries and other third parties, and prevailing economic conditions. The amount of cash available for distribution also depends on the partnership's operating and general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and organic growth projects, debt service requirements, working capital needs, ability to borrow funds and access capital markets, revolving credit facility restrictions, cash reserves and other risks affecting cash levels. Increasing the partnership's borrowings or other debt to finance its growth strategy could increase interest expense, which could impact the amount of cash available for distributions.. <U+FEFF>. There are no limitations in the partnership agreement regarding its ability to issue additional units. Should the partnership issue additional units in connection with an acquisition or expansion, the distributions on the incremental units will increase the risk that the partnership will be unable to maintain or increase distributions on a per unit basis.. <U+FEFF>. Increases in interest rates could adversely impact the partnership's unit price, ability to issue equity or incur debt, and pay cash distributions at intended levels.. <U+FEFF>. The partnership's cash distributions and implied distribution yield affect its unit price. Distributions are often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities when making investment decisions. A rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on the partnership's unit price, ability to issue equity or incur debt or pay cash distributions at intended levels, which could adversely impact the value of our investment in the partnership.. <U+FEFF>. We may be required to pay taxes on our share of the partnership's income that are greater than the cash distributions we receive from the partnership.. <U+FEFF>. The unitholders of the partnership generally include, for purposes of calculating their U.S. federal, state and local income taxes, their share of the partnership's taxable income, whether they have received cash distributions from the partnership. We ultimately may not receive cash distributions from the partnership equal to our share of taxable income or the taxes that are due with respect to that income, which could negatively impact our liquidity.. <U+FEFF>. A majority of the executive officers and directors of the partnership are also officers of our company, which could result in conflicts of interest.. <U+FEFF>. We indirectly own and control the partnership and appoint all of its officers and directors. A majority of the executive officers and directors of the partnership are also officers or directors of our company. Although our directors and officers have a fiduciary responsibility to manage the company in a manner that is beneficial to us, as directors and officers of the partnership, they also have certain duties to the partnership and its unitholders. Conflicts of interest may arise between us and our affiliates, and the partnership and its unitholders, and in resolving these conflicts, the partnership may favor its own interests over the company's interests. In certain circumstances, the partnership may refer conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest to its conflicts committee, which must consist entirely of independent directors, for resolution. The conflicts committee must act in the best interests of the public unitholders of the partnership. As a result, the partnership may manage its business in a manner that differs from the best interests of the company or our stockholders, which could adversely affect our profitability.. <U+FEFF>. 25. Cash available for distributions could be reduced and likely cause a substantial reduction in unit value if the partnership became subject to entity-level taxation for federal income tax purposes.. <U+FEFF>. The present federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or investments in its units could be modified, at any time, by administrative, legislative or judicial changes and interpretations. From time to time, members of Congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. Should any legislative proposal eliminate the qualifying income exception, all publicly traded partnerships would be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes. The partnership would be required to pay federal income tax on its taxable income at the corporate tax rate and likely state and local income taxes at varying rates as well. Distributions to unitholders would be taxed as corporate distributions. The partnership's cash available for distributions and the value of the units would be substantially reduced.. <U+FEFF>. Risks Related to our Common Stock. <U+FEFF>. The price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to factors beyond our control.. <U+FEFF>. Some of the many factors that can influence the price of our common stock include:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour results of operations and the performance of our competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpublic's reaction to our press releases, public announcements and filings with the SEC;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by equity research analysts who follow us or other companies in our industry;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in general economic conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in market prices for our products or raw materials and related substitutes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and significant shareholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactions by institutional investors trading in our stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisruptions in our operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in our management team;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother developments affecting us, our industry or our competitors; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tU.S. and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance.. <U+FEFF>. In recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, which are sometimes unrelated to the operating performance of any particular company. These broad market fluctuations could materially reduce the price of our common stock price based on factors that have little or nothing to do with our company or its performance.. <U+FEFF>. Anti-takeover provisions could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us.. <U+FEFF>. Our restated articles of incorporation, restated bylaws and Iowa's law contain anti-takeover provisions that could delay or prevent change in control of us or our management. These provisions discourage proxy contests, making it difficult for our shareholders to elect directors or take other corporate actions without the consent of our board of directors, which include:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tboard members have three-year staggered terms;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tboard members can only be removed for cause with an affirmative vote of no less than two-thirds of the outstanding shares;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshareholder action can only be taken at a special or annual meeting, not by written consent except where required by Iowa law;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshareholders are restricted from making proposals at shareholder meetings; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe board of directors can issue authorized or unissued shares of stock.. <U+FEFF>. We are subject to the provisions of the Iowa Business Corporations Act, which prohibits combinations between an Iowa corporation whose stock is publicly traded or held by more than 2,000 shareholders and an interested shareholder for three years unless certain exemption requirements are met.. 26. <U+FEFF>. Provisions in the convertible notes could also make it more difficult or too expensive for a third party to acquire us. If a takeover constitutes a fundamental change, holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes in cash. If a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their notes. In either case, the obligation under the notes could increase the acquisition cost and discourage a third party from acquiring us.. <U+FEFF>. These items discourage transactions that could otherwise command a premium over prevailing market prices and may limit the price investors are willing to pay for our stock.. <U+FEFF>. Non-U.S. shareholders may be subject to U.S. income tax on gains related to the sale of their common stock.. If we are a U.S. real property holding corporation during the shorter of the five-year period before the stock was sold or the period the stock was held by a non-U.S. shareholder, the non-U.S. shareholder could be subject to U.S federal income tax on gains related to the sale of their common stock. Whether we are a U.S. real property holding corporation depends on the fair market value of our U.S. real property interests relative to our other trade or business assets and non-U.S. real property interests. We cannot provide assurance that we are not a U.S. real property holding corporation or will not become one in the future.. <U+FEFF>"
