[1] "Item 1A.    Risk Factors.. Radian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs.. In order to be eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs, mortgage insurers such as Radian Guaranty must meet the GSEs' eligibility requirements, or PMIERs, which became effective December 31, 2015. The PMIERs are comprehensive, covering virtually all aspects of the business of a private mortgage insurer, including internal risk management and quality controls, the relationship between the GSEs and the approved insurer and the approved insurer's financial condition, as well as extensive requirements related to the conduct and operations of a mortgage insurer's business. The GSEs have significant discretion under the PMIERs and may amend the PMIERs at any time. If Radian Guaranty is unable to satisfy the requirements set forth in the PMIERs, Freddie Mac and/or Fannie Mae could restrict it from conducting certain types of business with them or take actions that may include not purchasing loans insured by Radian Guaranty.. The PMIERs financial requirements currently require that a mortgage insurer's Available Assets meet or exceed its Minimum Required Assets. At December 31, 2017, Radian Guaranty was in compliance with the PMIERs financial requirements and had Available Assets under the PMIERs of approximately $3.7 billion, which resulted in an excess or \"cushion\" of approximately $450 million over its Minimum Required Assets of approximately $3.2 billion. Radian Guaranty's ability to continue to comply with the PMIERs financial requirements could be impacted by: (i) the product mix of our NIW and factors affecting the performance of our mortgage insurance portfolio, including our level of defaults, prepayments, the losses we incur on new or existing defaults and the credit characteristics of our mortgage insurance; (ii) the amount of credit that we receive under the PMIERs financial requirements for our third-party reinsurance transactions (which is subject to periodic review by the GSEs), including the credit received for our QSR Transactions and our 2016 and 2018 Single Premium QSR Transactions; and (iii) potential updates to the PMIERs, including an increase in the capital requirements under the PMIERs financial requirements and a potential requirement to mark-to-market certain of Radian Guaranty's Available Assets. The PMIERs provide that the factors used to determine a mortgage insurer's Minimum Required Assets may be updated every two years or more frequently, as determined by the GSEs, to reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions or loan performance, and the GSEs have periodically made other changes to the PMIERs since their adoption. As further discussed below, the GSEs are currently in the process of updating the PMIERs, including, among other items, the factors used to determine a mortgage insurer's Minimum Required Assets.. Under the PMIERs financial requirements there are increased financial requirements for loans with a higher likelihood of default and/or certain credit characteristics, such as higher LTVs and lower FICO scores, as well as for loans originated after January 1, 2016 that are insured under lender-paid mortgage insurance policies not subject to automatic termination under the HPA. Therefore, if our mix of business includes more loans that are subject to these increased financial requirements, it increases the amount of Available Assets that Radian Guaranty is required to hold. Depending on the circumstances, we may limit the type and volume of business we are willing to write for certain of our products based on the increased financial requirements associated with certain loans. This could reduce the amount of NIW we write, which could reduce our revenues. During the third and fourth quarters of 2017, Radian Guaranty experienced an increase in reported delinquencies in the FEMA Designated Areas associated with hurricanes Harvey and Irma, as compared to 2016. Although, based on past experience, we believe the incremental hurricane-related defaults will cure within the next 12 months without resulting in a material number of paid claims or a material impact on our loss reserves, the temporary increase in defaults has increased our Minimum Required Assets and reduced our cushion under the PMIERs, as a result of the PMIERs requiring a higher level of Minimum Required Assets for defaults.. Compliance with the PMIERs financial requirements could impact our holding company liquidity. If additional cash from Radian Group is required to support Radian Guaranty's compliance with the PMIERs financial requirements, it will leave less liquidity to satisfy Radian Group's other obligations. Depending on the amount of liquidity that is utilized from Radian Group, we may be required (or may decide) to seek additional capital by incurring additional debt, issuing additional equity, or selling assets, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms, if at all.. In addition to the PMIERs financial requirements, the PMIERs contain requirements related to the operations of our mortgage insurance business, including extensive operational requirements in areas such as claim processing, loss mitigation, document retention, underwriting, quality control, reporting and monitoring, among others. These increased operational requirements have resulted in additional expenses and have required substantial time and effort from management and our employees, which we expect will continue.. 48. Table of Contents. Glossary. Part 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________. Compliance with the PMIERs requires us to obtain the prior consent of the GSEs before taking many actions, which may include payment of dividends, entering into various intercompany agreements and commuting or reinsuring risk, among others. These restrictions could prohibit or delay Radian Guaranty from taking certain actions that would be advantageous to it or its affiliates.. Radian Guaranty received, on a confidential basis, a summary of proposed changes to the PMIERs on December 18, 2017. The GSEs have informed us that they expect updates to the PMIERs will become effective in the fourth quarter of 2018. Based on this initial summary, which remains subject to comment by the private mortgage insurance industry, it is reasonably likely that updates to the PMIERs could, among other things, result in a material increase to Radian Guaranty's capital requirements under the PMIERs. Revisions to the PMIERs could impact our NIW and our returns. Radian expects to be able to fully comply with the proposed PMIERs as of the expected effective date in late 2018.. Although we expect Radian Guaranty to retain its eligibility status with the GSEs and to continue to comply with the PMIERs financial requirements, including as they may be updated, we cannot provide assurance that this will occur. Loss of Radian Guaranty's eligibility status with the GSEs would have an immediate and material adverse impact on the franchise value of our mortgage insurance business and our future prospects, as well as a material negative impact on our future results of operations and financial condition.. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive state insurance regulations and other requirements, which we may fail to satisfy.. We and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive, detailed regulation by the insurance regulators in the states where they are licensed to transact business. These regulations are principally designed for the protection of our insurance policyholders rather than for the benefit of investors. Insurance laws vary from state to state, but generally grant broad supervisory powers to examine insurance companies and enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business, including the power to revoke or restrict an insurance company's ability to write new business.. Among other matters, the state insurance regulators impose various capital requirements on our mortgage insurance subsidiaries. These include risk-to-capital ratios, other risk-based capital measures and surplus requirements that may limit the amount of insurance that our mortgage insurance subsidiaries write. Our failure to maintain adequate levels of capital, among other things, could lead to intervention by the various insurance regulatory authorities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, business prospects and financial condition.. If Radian Guaranty is not in compliance with a state's applicable Statutory RBC Requirement, it may be prohibited from writing new business in that state until it is back in compliance or it receives a waiver of, or similar relief from, the requirement. In those states that do not have a Statutory RBC Requirement, it is not clear what actions the applicable state regulators would take if a mortgage insurer fails to meet the Statutory RBC Requirement established by another state. As of December 31, 2017, Radian Guaranty was in compliance with all applicable Statutory RBC Requirements; however, if Radian Guaranty were to fail to meet the Statutory RBC Requirement in one or more states, it could be required to suspend writing business in some or all of the states in which it does business. In addition, the GSEs and our mortgage lending customers may decide not to conduct new business with Radian Guaranty (or may reduce current business levels) or impose restrictions on Radian Guaranty while it was not in compliance. The franchise value of our mortgage insurance business likely would be significantly diminished if we were prohibited from writing new business or restricted in the amount of new business we could write in one or more states.. Radian Group also may be required to provide capital support for Radian Guaranty and its affiliated insurers if additional capital is required by those subsidiaries pursuant to future changes to insurance laws and regulations. The NAIC is in the process of reviewing the minimum capital and surplus requirements for mortgage insurers and considering changes to the Model Act. While the timing and outcome of this process is not known, in the event the NAIC adopts changes to the Model Act, we expect that the capital requirements in states that adopt the new Model Act may increase as a result of the changes. Although the outcome of this process remains uncertain, we believe that if changes are made to the Model Act it will not result in financial requirements that require greater capital than the level currently required under the PMIERs financial requirements.. 49. Table of Contents. Glossary. Part 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________. Our mortgage insurance subsidiaries' premium rates and policy forms are generally subject to regulation in every state in which they are licensed to transact business. These regulations are intended to protect policyholders against the adverse effects of excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates and to encourage competition in the insurance marketplace. In most states where our insurance subsidiaries are licensed, premium rates and policy forms must be filed with the state insurance regulatory authority and, in some states, must be approved, before their use. The mortgage insurance industry has always been highly competitive with respect to pricing. In the recent past, the willingness of mortgage insurers to offer reduced pricing (whether through filed or customized rates) led to an increased demand from certain lenders for reduced rate products. We and other mortgage insurers have been subject to inquiries from the Wisconsin Department of Insurance and examination by the California Department of Insurance regarding customized insurance rates and policy form filings. In 2016, the California Department of Insurance issued guidance to the mortgage insurance industry stating that under California law, permissible discounting of mortgage insurance rates must be applied to all similarly situated customers. The current regulatory environment could increase the likelihood that additional regulatory inquiries or examinations may be initiated. The limited flexibility currently provided under existing regulatory requirements with respect to insurance rates makes it more difficult to respond to competitor pricing actions and customer demands in a timely fashion. We could lose business opportunities if we are unable to respond to competitor pricing actions and our customers' demands in a timely and acceptable manner.. The credit performance of our insured portfolio is impacted by macroeconomic conditions and specific events that affect the ability of borrowers to pay their mortgages.. As a seller of mortgage credit protection and mortgage and real estate products and services, our results are subject to macroeconomic conditions and specific events that impact the mortgage origination environment, the credit performance of our underlying insured assets and the business opportunities for our businesses. Many of these conditions are beyond our control, including national and regional economic conditions, housing prices, unemployment levels, interest rate changes, the availability of credit and other factors. In general, a deterioration in economic conditions increases the likelihood that borrowers will be unable to satisfy their mortgage obligations and can also adversely affect housing values, which in turn can influence the willingness of borrowers to continue to make mortgage payments despite having the financial resources to do so.. Mortgage defaults also can occur due to a variety of specific events affecting borrowers, including death or illness, divorce or other family problems, unemployment, or other events. In addition, factors impacting regional economic conditions, acts of terrorism, war or other severe conflicts, event-specific economic depressions or other catastrophic events could result in increased defaults due to the impact of such events on the ability of borrowers to satisfy their mortgage obligations and the value of affected homes.. Unfavorable macroeconomic developments and the other factors cited above could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.. The length of time that our mortgage insurance policies remain in force could decline and result in a decrease in our revenue.. As of December 31, 2017, 69% of our total primary IIF consists of policies for which we expect to receive premiums in the future, typically through Monthly Premium Policies. As a result, most of our earned premiums are derived from insurance that was written in prior years. The length of time that this insurance remains in force, which we refer to as the Persistency Rate, is a significant determinant of our future revenues. A lower Persistency Rate could reduce our future revenues. The factors affecting the length of time that our insurance remains in force include:. • prevailing mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage rates on our IIF, which affects the incentive for borrowers to refinance (i.e., lower current interest rates make it more attractive for borrowers to refinance and receive a lower interest rate);. • applicable policies for mortgage insurance cancellation, along with the current value of the homes underlying the mortgages in our IIF;. • the credit policies of lenders, which may make it more difficult for homeowners to refinance loans; and. • economic conditions that can affect a borrower's decision to pay-off a mortgage earlier than required.. If these or other factors cause a decrease in the length of time that our Monthly Premium Policies (or other policies for which we expect to receive premiums in the future) remain in force, our future revenues could be negatively impacted, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.. 50. Table of Contents. Glossary. Part 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________. Our Loss Mitigation Activity is not expected to mitigate losses to the same extent as in prior years; Loss Mitigation Activity could continue to negatively impact our customer relationships.. As part of our claims management process we pursue opportunities to mitigate losses both before and after we receive claims, including processes to ensure claims are valid. Following the financial crisis, our Loss Mitigation Activities, such as Rescissions, Claim Denials and Claim Curtailments, increased significantly in response to the poor underwriting, servicer negligence and general non-compliance with our insurance policies that was prevalent in the period leading up to the financial crisis. These Loss Mitigation Activities materially mitigated our paid losses during this period and resulted in a significant reduction in our loss reserves. As our Legacy Portfolio has become a smaller percentage of our overall insured portfolio and mortgage underwriting and servicing have generally improved, there has been a decrease in the amount of Loss Mitigation Activity required with respect to the claims we receive, and we expect this trend to continue. As a result, our future Loss Mitigation Activity is not expected to mitigate our paid losses to the same extent as in prior years.. In addition, under the master policies developed with the GSEs in 2014, including our 2014 Master Policy for NIW after October 1, 2014, the potential for Loss Mitigation Activity generally is more limited throughout the private mortgage insurance industry, with only limited exceptions. Radian Guaranty also offers 12-month and 36-month rescission relief programs in accordance with the specified terms and conditions set forth in the 2014 Master Policy. Further, the FHFA and the GSEs have proposed revised GSE Rescission Relief Principles to, among other things, further limit the circumstances under which mortgage insurers may rescind coverage. The GSEs have requested that these principles be incorporated into new master policies which they expect to be effective for new business written in 2019. We currently are in discussions with the GSEs regarding these proposed principles, which if adopted, are likely to further reduce our ability to rescind insurance coverage in the future, potentially resulting in higher losses than would be the case under our existing master insurance policies.. Our Loss Mitigation Activities and claims paying practices have resulted in disputes with certain of our customers and in some cases, damaged our relationships with customers, resulting in a loss of business. While we have resolved many of these disputes, a risk remains that our Loss Mitigation Activities or claims paying practices could continue to have a negative impact on our relationships with customers or potential customers. Further, disputes with our customers that are not resolved could result in additional arbitration or judicial proceedings beyond those we are currently facing. See \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\" To the extent that past or future Loss Mitigation Activities or claims paying practices impact our customer relationships, our competitive position could be adversely affected, resulting in the potential loss of business and impacting our results of operations.. Changes in the charters, business practices, or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market generally, could significantly impact our mortgage insurance business.. Our current business model is highly dependent on the GSEs as the GSEs are the primary beneficiaries of most of our mortgage insurance policies. The GSEs' federal charters generally require credit enhancement for low down payment mortgage loans (i.e., a loan amount that exceeds 80% of a home's value) in order for such loans to be eligible for purchase by them. Lenders generally have used private mortgage insurance to satisfy this credit enhancement requirement. As a result, low down payment mortgages purchased by the GSEs generally are insured with private mortgage insurance. In order to be eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs, mortgage insurers such as Radian Guaranty must meet the GSEs' eligibility requirements, or PMIERs.. The GSEs' business practices may be impacted by their results of operations, as well as by legislative or regulatory changes. Since September 2008, the GSEs have been operating under the conservatorship of the FHFA. With respect to loans purchased by the GSEs, changes in the business practices of the GSEs, which can be implemented by the GSEs acting independently or through their conservator, the FHFA, could negatively impact our mortgage insurance business and financial performance, including changes to:. • eligibility requirements for a mortgage insurer to become and remain an approved eligible insurer for the GSEs;. • changes to underwriting standards on mortgages they purchase, including for example, the GSEs' decision to expand credit in 2017 by purchasing a larger portion of loans with debt-to-income ratios greater than 45%;. • policies or requirements that may result in a reduction in the number of mortgages they acquire;. • the national conforming loan limit for mortgages they acquire;. • the level of mortgage insurance required, including expanding the loans that are eligible for reduced insurance coverage;. 51. Table of Contents. Glossary. Part 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________. • the terms on which mortgage insurance coverage may be canceled before reaching the cancellation thresholds established by law;. • the terms required to be included in master policies for the mortgage insurance policies they acquire, including limitations on our ability to mitigate losses on insured mortgages that are in default;. • the amount of loan level price adjustments (based on risk) or guarantee fees (which may result in a higher cost to borrowers) that the GSEs charge on loans that require mortgage insurance; and. • the degree of influence that the GSEs have over a mortgage lender's selection of the mortgage insurer providing coverage.. The FHFA has called for the GSEs to transfer a meaningful portion of credit risk, known as a \"credit risk transfer,\" to the private sector. This mandate builds upon the goals set in each of the last three years for the GSEs to increase the role of private capital by experimenting with different forms of transactions and structures. To this end, the GSEs have transferred a portion of credit risk on over $2.0 trillion of unpaid principal balance from the start of their credit risk transfer programs in 2013 through the end of 2017. During 2016 and 2017, we have participated in these credit risk transfer programs developed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. For additional information about these programs, see \"Item 1. Business - Mortgage Insurance - Mortgage Insurance Business Overview - Mortgage Insurance Products - GSE Credit Risk Transfer.\" It is difficult to predict what other types of transactions and structures may be used. If any of the credit risk transfer transactions and structures were to displace primary loan level, standard levels of mortgage insurance, the amount of insurance we write may be reduced, which could negatively impact our franchise value, results of operations and financial condition. As a result, the impact of any credit risk transfer products and transactions implemented by the GSEs is uncertain and hard to predict.. Since the FHFA was appointed as conservator of the GSEs, there have been a wide range of legislative proposals to reform the U.S. housing finance market, including recent proposals that would repurpose the GSEs and have them compete with other secondary market participants. In addition, the Trump Administration and U.S. Treasury have stated that they are seeking to advance housing finance reform, particularly if the U.S. Congress does not take action to end the current conservatorship of the GSEs. Under current law, the FHFA has significant discretion with respect to the future state of the GSEs, including the ability to place the GSEs into receivership without further legislative action. The term of the current director of the FHFA ends in January 2019, which may increase the likelihood that the FHFA could take action to reform the GSEs.. The future structure of the residential housing finance system remains uncertain, including whether comprehensive housing reform legislation will be adopted and, if so, what form it may ultimately take. It is difficult to predict the impact of any changes on our business. See \"Item 1. Business - Regulation - Federal Regulation - Housing Finance Reform.\" Although we believe that traditional private mortgage insurance will continue to play an important role in any future housing finance structure, new federal legislation could reduce the level of private mortgage insurance coverage used by the GSEs as credit enhancement, or even eliminate the requirement, which would significantly reduce our available market, diminish the franchise value of our mortgage insurance business and materially and adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.. A decrease in the volume of mortgage originations could result in fewer opportunities for us to write new insurance business.. The amount of new business we write depends, among other things, on a steady flow of low down payment mortgages that benefit from our mortgage insurance. The volume of low down payment mortgage originations is impacted by a number of factors, including:. • restrictions on mortgage credit due to changes in lender underwriting standards, more restrictive regulatory requirements such as the required ability-to-pay determination prior to extending credit, and the significantly reduced private securitization market;. • mortgage interest rates;. • the health of the domestic economy generally, as well as specific conditions in regional and local economies;. • housing affordability;. • tax laws and policies, including the TCJA and other recent tax-related legislation, and their impact on the deductions for mortgage insurance premiums, mortgage interest payments and real estate taxes;. • population trends, including the rate of household formation;. 52. Table of Contents. Glossary. Part 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________. • the rate of home price appreciation;. • government housing policy encouraging loans to first-time homebuyers; and. • the practices of the GSEs, including the extent to which the guaranty fees, loan level price adjustments (based on risk), credit underwriting guidelines and other business terms provided by the GSEs affect lenders' willingness to extend credit for low down payment mortgages.. If the overall volume of new mortgage originations declines, we could experience a reduced opportunity to write new insurance business and likely will be subject to increased competition, which could negatively affect our business prospects, results of operations and our financial condition.. Our NIW and franchise value could decline if we lose business from significant customers.. Our mortgage insurance business depends on our relationships with our customers. Our customers place insurance with us directly on loans that they originate and they also do business with us indirectly through purchases of loans that already have our mortgage insurance coverage. Our relationships with our customers may influence both the amount of business they do with us directly and also their willingness to continue to approve us as a mortgage insurance provider for loans that they purchase. The loss of business from significant customers could have an adverse effect on the amount of new business we are able to write, and consequently, our franchise value.. During 2017, our top 10 mortgage insurance customers (measured by NIW) were responsible for 32.4% of our primary NIW, as compared to 31.7% in 2016. Although we have taken steps to diversify our customer base, if we were to lose a significant customer, it is unlikely that the loss could be completely offset by other customers in the near-term, if at all. Some of our lending customers may decide to write business only with a limited number of mortgage insurers or only with certain mortgage insurers, based on their views with respect to an insurer's pricing, service levels, underwriting guidelines, loss mitigation practices, financial strength or other factors. Alternatively, certain other lending customers have chosen for risk management purposes to diversify and expand the number of mortgage insurers with which they do business, which has negatively affected our level of NIW and market share with those customers. Given that many of our customers currently give us a significant portion of their total mortgage insurance business, it is possible that if there is further diversification it could have a negative impact on our NIW if we are unable to mitigate the market share loss through new customers or increases in business with other customers. Further, we actively engage with our customers to ensure that we are receiving an appropriate mix of business from such customers at acceptable projected returns, and depending on the circumstances, we could take action with respect to customers (e.g., limiting the type of business we accept from them or instituting pricing changes that impact them) that could result in customers reducing the amount of business they do with us or deciding not to do business with us altogether. Any significant loss in our market share could negatively impact our mortgage insurance franchise, results of operations and financial condition.. Our mortgage insurance business faces intense competition.. The U.S. mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive. Our competitors include other private mortgage insurers and governmental agencies, principally the FHA and VA.. We currently compete with other private mortgage insurers that are eligible to write business for the GSEs on the basis of price, underwriting guidelines, customer relationships, reputation, perceived financial strength (including based on credit ratings) and overall service. Overall service includes services offered through our Services business that complement our mortgage insurance products. Overall service competition is based on, among other things, effective and timely delivery of products, timeliness of claims payments, timely and accurate servicing of policies, training, loss mitigation efforts and management and field service expertise.. Pricing has always been and continues to be competitive in the mortgage insurance industry, as industry participants compete for market share and customer relationships. See \"Item 1. Business - Mortgage Insurance - Competition.\". We monitor various competitive and economic factors while seeking to balance both profitability and market share considerations in developing our pricing and origination strategies. We have taken a disciplined approach to establishing our premium rates and writing a mix of business that we expect to produce our targeted level of returns on a blended basis and an acceptable level of NIW. See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Mortgage Insurance - NIW, IIF, RIF.\" Although we believe we are well-positioned to compete effectively, our pricing strategy may not be successful. Despite our pricing actions, we may experience returns below our targeted returns and we may lose business to other competitors. There can be no assurance that pricing competition will not intensify further, which could result in a decrease in projected returns for the industry and for Radian Guaranty.. 53. Table of Contents. Glossary. Part 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________. Certain of our private mortgage insurance competitors are subsidiaries of larger corporations, may have access to greater amounts of capital and financial resources than we do at a lower cost of capital (including, as a result of tax advantaged, off-shore reinsurance vehicles) and have better financial strength ratings than we have. As a result, they may be better positioned to compete outside of traditional mortgage insurance, including if the GSEs expand their use of, or pursue alternative forms of, credit enhancement. In addition, because of tax advantages associated with being off-shore, certain of our competitors have been able to achieve higher after-tax rates of return on the NIW they write compared to on-shore mortgage insurers such as Radian Guaranty, which could allow these off-shore competitors to leverage reduced pricing to gain market share, while continuing to achieve acceptable returns on NIW. The impact of the recently enacted TCJA may, in some cases, reduce the tax advantage of being off-shore, depending on the specific tax facts and circumstances for each competitor.. We also compete with governmental entities, such as the FHA and VA, that typically do not have the same capital requirements or business objectives that we and other private mortgage insurance companies have, and therefore, may have greater financial flexibility in their pricing guidelines and capacity that could put us at a competitive disadvantage. If these entities lower their pricing or alter the terms and conditions of their mortgage insurance or other credit enhancement products in furtherance of political, social or other goals rather than a profit motive, we may be unable to compete in that market effectively, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.. Beginning in 2008, the FHA, which historically had not been a significant competitor, substantially increased its share of the mortgage insurance market, including by insuring a number of loans that would meet our current underwriting guidelines, sometimes at a lower monthly cost to the borrower than a loan that carries our mortgage insurance. While the private mortgage insurance industry generally had been recapturing market share from the FHA, in January 2015, the FHA reduced its annual mortgage insurance premium by 50 basis points, which has impacted our competitiveness with respect to certain high-LTV loans to borrowers with FICO scores below 720.. The FHA may continue to maintain a strong market position and could increase its market position again in the future. Factors that could cause the FHA to remain a significant competitor include:. • governmental policy, including further decreases in the pricing of FHA insurance or changes in the terms of such insurance;. • capital constraints of the private mortgage insurance industry;. • the tightening by private mortgage insurers of underwriting guidelines based on risk concerns, including recent changes by us and other private mortgage insurers to tighten guidelines for certain loans with debt-to-income ratios greater than 45%;. • increases in the loan level price adjustments (based on risk) charged by the GSEs on loans that require mortgage insurance and changes in the amount of guarantee fees for the loans that they acquire (which may result in higher cost to borrowers); and. • the perceived operational ease of using FHA insurance compared to the products of private mortgage insurers.. Other private mortgage insurers may seek to regain market share from the FHA or other mortgage insurers by reducing pricing, which could, in turn, improve their competitive position in the industry and negatively impact our level of NIW.. We have faced increasing competition from the VA. Based on publicly available information, the VA accounted for 26% of the insurable mortgage market in 2017. We believe that the VA's market share has generally been increasing because the VA offers 100% LTV loans and charges a one-time funding fee that can be included in the loan amount with no additional monthly expense, and because of an increase in the number of borrowers that are eligible for the VA's program.. In addition, as market conditions change, alternatives to traditional private mortgage insurance may become more prevalent, which could reduce the demand for private mortgage insurance in its traditional form, including:. • potential structures commonly referred to as \"investor paid mortgage insurance\" in which affiliates of traditional mortgage insurers directly insure the GSEs against loss;. • lenders and other investors holding mortgages in their portfolio and self-insuring;. • lenders using pass-through vehicles that take on the risk of loss for loans ultimately sold to the GSEs;. • structured risk transfer transactions in the capital markets;. • risk sharing, risk transfer or using other risk mitigation techniques in conjunction with reduced levels of private mortgage insurance coverage; and. 54. Table of Contents. Glossary. Part 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________. • lenders originating mortgages using \"piggyback\" structures to avoid private mortgage insurance, such as a first-lien mortgage with an 80% LTV and a second mortgage with a 10%, 15% or 20% LTV, which could become more attractive if the tax deduction for mortgage insurance premiums is not extended beyond the 2017 tax year.. Managing the competitive environment is extremely challenging given the multitude of various factors discussed above. If we do not appropriately manage the strategic decisions required in this environment, our franchise value, business prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.. Our business depends, in part, on effective and reliable loan servicing.. We depend on third-party servicing of the loans that we insure. Dependable servicing is necessary for timely billing and effective loss mitigation opportunities for delinquent or near-delinquent loans. Changes in the servicing industry, challenging economic and market conditions or periods of economic stress and high mortgage defaults could negatively affect the ability of servicers to effectively service the loans that we insure. Further, servicers are required to comply with more burdensome requirements, procedures and standards for servicing residential mortgages than in the past, such as the CFPB's mortgage servicing rules. While these requirements are intended to improve servicing performance, they also impose a high cost of compliance on servicers that may impact their financial condition and their operating effectiveness. If we experience a disruption in the servicing of mortgage loans covered by our insurance policies, this, in turn, could contribute to a rise in defaults and/or claims among those loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.. An extension in the period of time that a loan remains in our delinquent loan inventory may increase the severity of claims that we ultimately are required to pay.. High levels of defaults and corresponding delays in foreclosures could delay our receipt of claims, resulting in an increase in the period of time that a loan remains in our delinquent loan inventory, and as a result, the severity of claims that we are ultimately required to pay. Following the financial crisis, the average time that it took for us to receive a claim increased. This was, in part, due to loss mitigation protocols that were established by servicers and also to a significant backlog of foreclosure proceedings in many states, and especially in those states that impose a judicial process for foreclosures. Generally, foreclosure delays do not stop the accrual of interest or affect other expenses on a loan, and unless a loan is cured during such delay, once title to the property ultimately is obtained and a claim is filed, our paid claim amount may include additional interest and expenses, increasing the severity of claims we ultimately are required to pay. While foreclosure timelines have improved in recent years, a portion of our Legacy Portfolio consists of severely delinquent loans. Further, another period of significant economic stress and a high level of defaults could once again delay claims and result in higher levels of Claim Severity. Higher levels of Claim Severity would increase our incurred losses and could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.. Our success depends on our ability to assess and manage our underwriting risks; the premiums we charge may not be adequate to compensate us for our liability for losses and the amount of capital we are required to hold against our insured risks. We expect to incur future provisions for losses beyond what we have reserved for in our financial statements.. The estimates and expectations we use to establish premium rates are based on assumptions made at the time our insurance is written. Our mortgage insurance premiums are based on, among other items, the amount of capital we are required to hold against our insured risks and our estimates of the long-term risk of claims on insured loans. Our premium rates are established based on performance models that consider a broad range of borrower, loan and property characteristics (e.g., LTV, borrower FICO score, type of loan, premium structure, loan term, coverage percentage and whether there is a deductible in front of our loss position) as well as market and economic conditions. Our assumptions may ultimately prove to be inaccurate.. 55. Table of Contents. Glossary. Part 1 Item 1A.

If the risk underlying a mortgage loan we have insured develops more adversely than we anticipated, we generally cannot increase the premium rates on this in-force business, or cancel coverage or elect not to renew coverage, to mitigate the effects of such adverse developments. Similarly, we cannot adjust our premiums if the amount of capital we are required to hold against our insured risks increases from the amount we were required to hold at the time a policy was written (as occurred when the PMIERs financial requirements became effective and may occur again when the GSEs update the PMIERs which, as proposed, is reasonably likely to result in a material increase to Radian Guaranty's capital requirements under the PMIERs, among other things). As a result, if we are unable to compensate for or offset the increased capital requirements in other ways, the returns on our business may be lower than we assumed or expected. Our premiums earned and the associated investment income on those premiums may ultimately prove to be inadequate to compensate for the losses that we may incur and may not provide an adequate return on increased capital that may be required. As a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.. Additionally, in accordance with industry practice, we do not establish reserves in our mortgage insurance business until we are notified that a borrower has failed to make at least two monthly payments when due. Because our mortgage insurance reserving does not account for the impact of future losses that we expect to incur with respect to performing (non-defaulted) loans, our obligation for ultimate losses that we expect to incur at any period end is not reflected in our financial statements, except to the extent that a premium deficiency exists. As a result, our losses can be more severe in periods of high defaults given that we generally are not permitted to establish reserves in anticipation of such defaults.. If the estimates we use in establishing loss reserves are incorrect, we may be required to take unexpected charges to income, which could adversely affect our results of operations.. We establish loss reserves in our mortgage insurance business to provide for the estimated cost of future claims on defaulted loans. Setting our loss reserves requires significant judgment by management with respect to the likelihood, magnitude and timing of each potential loss, including an estimate of the impact of our Loss Mitigation Activities with respect to defaulted loans. The models, assumptions and estimates we use to establish loss reserves may not prove to be accurate, especially in the event of an extended economic downturn or a period of extreme market volatility and uncertainty. Because of this, claims paid may be substantially different than our loss reserves and these reserves may be insufficient to satisfy the full amount of claims that we ultimately have to pay. Changes to our estimates could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.. We have a number of defaulted loans in our portfolio originated before 2009 that have been in default for an extended period of time. While these loans are generally assigned a higher loss reserve based on our belief that they are more likely to result in a claim, we also assume, based on historical trends, that a significant portion of these loans will cure or otherwise not result in a claim. Given the significant period of time that these loans have been in default, it is possible that the ultimate cure rate for these defaulted loans will be less than our current estimates of Cures for this inventory of defaults. In addition, during the third and fourth quarters of 2017, Radian Guaranty experienced an increase in reported delinquencies in the FEMA Designated Areas associated with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Based on past experience, we believe (and our reserve estimates reflect) that most of the hurricane-related defaults will cure within the next 12 months without resulting in a material number of paid claims. If our estimates are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.. Our delegated underwriting program may subject our mortgage insurance business to unanticipated claims.. In our mortgage insurance business, we permit lenders to obtain mortgage insurance for residential mortgage loans originated and underwritten by them using Radian's pre-established underwriting guidelines. Once we accept a lender into our delegated underwriting program, we generally insure a mortgage loan originated by that lender based on our expectation that the lender has followed our specified underwriting guidelines in accordance with the endorsement. Under this program, a lender could commit us to insure a material number of loans with unacceptable risk profiles before we discover the problem and terminate that lender's delegated underwriting authority or pursue other rights that may be available to us, such as our rights to rescind coverage or deny claims.. 56. Table of Contents. Glossary. Part 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________. We face risks associated with our contract underwriting business.. We provide third-party contract underwriting services for both our mortgage insurance and Services customers. We provide these customers with limited indemnification rights with respect to those loans that we simultaneously underwrite for both secondary market compliance and for potential mortgage insurance eligibility. In addition, in certain circumstances, we may also offer limited indemnification when we underwrite a loan only for secondary market compliance. In addition to indemnification, we typically have limited loss mitigation defenses available to us for loans that we have underwritten through our contract underwriting services. As a consequence, our results of operations could be negatively impacted if we are required to indemnify our customers for material underwriting errors in our contract underwriting services.. The current financial strength ratings assigned to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries could weaken our competitive position.. Radian Guaranty has been assigned a rating of Baa3 by Moody's and a rating of BBB+ by S&P. While Radian Guaranty's financial strength ratings currently are investment grade, these ratings are below the ratings assigned to certain other private mortgage insurers. We do not believe our ratings have had a material adverse effect on our relationships with existing customers. However, if financial strength ratings become a more prominent consideration for lenders, we may be competitively disadvantaged by customers choosing to do business with private mortgage insurers that have higher financial strength ratings. In addition, the current PMIERs do not include a specific ratings requirement with respect to eligibility, but if this were to change in the future, we may become subject to a ratings requirement in order to retain our eligibility status under the PMIERs.. The GSEs currently consider financial strength ratings, among other items, to determine the amount of collateral that an insurer must post when participating in the credit risk transfer transactions currently being conducted by the GSEs. As a result, the returns that we are able to achieve when participating in these transactions are dependent, in part, on our financial strength ratings. We currently use Radian Reinsurance to participate in the GSEs' credit risk transfer transactions. Radian Reinsurance has been assigned a rating of BBB+ by S&P. Market participants with higher ratings than us generally have the ability to price more aggressively, and therefore, are better positioned than us to compete in these transactions.. We believe that financial strength ratings remain a significant consideration for participants seeking to secure credit enhancement in the non-GSE mortgage market, which includes most non-qualified mortgage loans. While this market has remained limited since the financial crisis, we view this market as an area of potential future growth and our ability to participate in this market could depend on our ability to secure higher ratings for our mortgage insurance subsidiaries. In addition, if legislative or regulatory changes were to alter the current state of the housing finance industry such that the GSEs no longer operated in their current capacity, we may be forced to compete in a new marketplace in which financial strength ratings may play a greater role. If we are unable to compete effectively in the current or any future markets as a result of the financial strength ratings assigned to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries, the franchise value and future prospects for our mortgage insurance business could be negatively affected.. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage risks in our investment portfolio.. Our investment portfolio is an important source of revenue and is our primary source of claims paying resources. Although our investment portfolio consists mostly of highly-rated fixed income investments, our investment strategy is affected by general economic conditions, which may adversely affect the markets for credit and interest-rate-sensitive securities, including the extent and timing of investor participation in these markets, the level and volatility of interest rates and credit spreads and, consequently, the value of our fixed income securities, and as such, we may not achieve our investment objectives. Volatility or lack of liquidity in the markets in which we hold positions has at times reduced the market value of some of our investments, and if this worsens substantially it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.. Although in recent years our portfolio yield has been increasing, interest rates and investment yields on our investments continue to be below historical averages, which has reduced the investment income we generate. For the significant portion of our investment portfolio held by our insurance subsidiaries, to receive full capital credit under insurance regulatory requirements and under the PMIERs, we generally are limited to investing in highly-rated investments that are unlikely to increase our investment returns. Because we depend on our investments as a source of revenue, a prolonged period of lower than expected investment yields would have an adverse impact on our revenues and could potentially adversely affect our results of operations. Further, future updates to the PMIERs could impact our investment choices, which could negatively impact our investment strategy.. 57. Table of Contents. Glossary. Part 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________. In addition, we structure our investment portfolio to satisfy our expected liabilities, including claim payments in our mortgage insurance business. If we underestimate our liabilities or improperly structure our investments to meet these liabilities, we could have unexpected losses resulting from the forced liquidation of investments before their maturity, which could adversely affect our results of operations.. Radian Group's sources of liquidity may be insufficient to fund its obligations.. Radian Group serves as the holding company for our operating subsidiaries and does not have any operations of its own. As of December 31, 2017, Radian Group had available, either directly or through unregulated subsidiaries, unrestricted cash and liquid investments of approximately $229 million. This amount: (i) includes $89 million deposited with the U.S. Treasury (which may be recalled by us at any time) in connection with the IRS Matter and (ii) includes certain additional cash and liquid investments that are expected to be received by Radian Group from our subsidiaries for corporate expenses and interest payments. Total liquidity, which includes our undrawn $225 million unsecured revolving credit facility entered into in October 2017, was $454 million as of December 31, 2017.. Radian Group's principal liquidity demands for the next 12 months are expected to include: (i) the payment of corporate expenses, including taxes; (ii) interest payments on our outstanding long-term debt; (iii) potential payments to the U.S. Treasury resulting from the IRS Matter if a compromised settlement with the IRS is reached; and (iv) the payment of dividends on our common stock. Radian Group's liquidity demands for the next 12 months could also include: (i) the repurchase of up to $50 million of Radian Group common stock pursuant to the existing share repurchase program; (ii) capital support for Radian Guaranty and our other mortgage insurance subsidiaries; (iii) repurchases or early redemptions of portions of our long-term debt; and (iv) potential investments to support our strategy for growing our businesses.. In addition to existing available cash and marketable securities, Radian Group's principal sources of cash to fund future short-term liquidity needs include payments made to Radian Group under tax- and expense-sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries. Radian Group has expense-sharing arrangements in place with its principal operating subsidiaries that require those subsidiaries to pay their allocated share of certain holding-company-level expenses, including interest payments on most of our outstanding long-term debt. The expense-sharing arrangements between Radian Group and our insurance subsidiaries, as amended, have been approved by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, but such approval may be modified or revoked at any time.. The Services segment has not generated sufficient cash flows to pay dividends to Radian Group. Additionally, while cash flow is expected to be sufficient to pay the Services segment's direct operating expenses, it has not been sufficient to satisfy its obligations to reimburse Radian Group for its allocated operating expense and interest expense under tax- and expense-sharing arrangements. We do not expect the Services segment will be able to bring its reimbursement obligations current for the foreseeable future. In the event the cash flow from operations of the Services segment is not adequate to fund all of its needs, Radian Group may provide additional funds to the Services segment in the form of a capital contribution or an intercompany note. Further, in light of Radian Guaranty's negative unassigned surplus related to operating losses in prior periods, we do not anticipate that Radian Guaranty will be permitted under applicable insurance laws to pay ordinary dividends to Radian Group for the foreseeable future.. In addition to our short-term liquidity needs discussed above, Radian Group's liquidity demands beyond the next 12 months are expected to include: (i) the repayment of our outstanding long-term debt; and (ii) potential additional capital contributions to our subsidiaries. We expect to meet the long-term liquidity needs of Radian Group with a combination of: (i) available cash and marketable securities; (ii) private or public issuances of debt or equity securities, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms, if at all; (iii) cash received under tax- and expense-sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries; (iv) to the extent available, dividends from our subsidiaries; and (v) any amounts that Radian Guaranty is able to successfully redeem under the Surplus Note.. As of December 31, 2017, certain of our subsidiaries have incurred NOLs that could not be carried-back and utilized on a separate company tax return basis. As a result, we are not currently obligated under our tax-sharing agreement to reimburse these subsidiaries for their separate company NOL carryforward. However, if in a future period, our consolidated NOL is fully utilized before a subsidiary has utilized its share of NOL carryforward on a separate entity basis, then Radian Group may be obligated to fund such subsidiary's share of our consolidated tax liability to the IRS. Certain subsidiaries, including Clayton, currently have NOLs on a separate entity basis that are available for future utilization. However, we do not expect to fund material obligations related to these subsidiary NOLs.. 58. Table of Contents. Glossary. Part 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________. In light of Radian Group's short- and long-term needs, it is possible that our sources of liquidity could be insufficient to fund our obligations and could exceed available holding company funds. If this were to occur, we may need or otherwise may decide to increase our available liquidity by incurring additional debt, by issuing additional equity or by selling assets, any of which we may be unable to do on favorable terms, if at all.. Our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that could limit our operating flexibility. We may not have access to funding under our credit facility when we require it.. Radian Group entered into a $225 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of bank lenders on October 16, 2017. Radian Group's obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by Clayton and may in the future be guaranteed by other subsidiaries of Radian Group. As of December 31, 2017, no borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility.. The credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that, among other things, provide certain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, create liens, transfer or dispose of assets, merge with or acquire other companies and pay dividends. The credit facility also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants and further provides that (i) Radian Group must be rated by S&P or Moody's and (ii) Radian Guaranty must remain eligible under the PMIERs to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. A failure to comply with these covenants or the other terms of the credit facility could result in an event of default, which could (i) result in the termination of the commitments by the lenders to make loans to Radian Group under the credit facility and (ii) enable the lenders to declare, subject to the terms and conditions of the credit facility, any outstanding obligations under the credit facility to be immediately due and payable.. If the commitments of the lenders are terminated or we are unable to satisfy certain covenants or representations, we may not have access to funding in a timely manner, or at all, when we require it. If funding is not available under the credit facility when we require it, our ability to continue our business practices or pursue our current strategy could be limited. If the indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If there were to be an event of default under our credit facility for any reason, our cash flows, financial results or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.. Our reported earnings are subject to fluctuations based on changes in our trading securities and short-term investments that require us to adjust their fair market value.. We have significant holdings of trading securities and short-term investments that we carry at fair value. Because the changes in fair value of these financial instruments are reflected on our statements of operations each period, they affect our reported earnings and can create earnings volatility. Among other factors, interest rate changes, market volatility and declines in the value of underlying collateral will impact the value of our investments, potentially resulting in unrealized losses that could negatively impact our results of operations.. Our information technology systems may fail or become outmoded, be temporarily interrupted or otherwise cause us to be unable to meet our customers' demands.. Our business is highly dependent on the effective operation of our information technology systems, which are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, security breaches, catastrophic events and errors in usage. Although we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, we may not be able to adequately execute these plans in a timely fashion.. Additionally, our ability to meet the needs of our customers depends on our ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available or otherwise upgrade our technological capabilities. Participants in the mortgage insurance industry rely on e-commerce and other technologies to provide their products and services, and our customers generally require that we provide an increasing number of our products and services electronically. Accordingly, we may not satisfy our customers' requirements if we fail to invest sufficient resources or are otherwise unable to maintain and upgrade our technological capabilities. Further, customers may choose to do business only with mortgage insurers with which they are technologically compatible and may choose to retain existing mortgage insurance providers rather than invest the time and resources to on-board new providers. As a result, technology can represent a potential barrier to signing new customers.. Because we rely on our information technology systems for many critical functions, including connecting with our customers, if such systems were to fail, experience a prolonged interruption, or become outmoded, we may experience a significant disruption in our operations and in the business we receive, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.. 59. Table of Contents. Glossary. Part 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________. In addition, we are in the process of implementing a major technology project to improve our operating systems, including a new platform for our mortgage insurance underwriting, policy administration, claims management and billing processes. The implementation of these technological improvements is complex, expensive, time consuming and, in certain respects, depends on the ability of third parties to perform their obligations in a timely manner. If we fail to timely and successfully implement the new technology systems and business processes, or if the systems do not operate as expected, it could have an adverse impact on our business, business prospects and results of operations.. The security of our information technology systems may be compromised and confidential information, including non-public personal information that we maintain, could be improperly disclosed.. Our information technology systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions, computer viruses or other attacks. As part of our business, we, and certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates, maintain large amounts of confidential information, including non-public personal information on consumers and our employees. Breaches in security could result in the loss or misuse of this information, which could, in turn, result in potential regulatory actions or litigation, including material claims for damages, as well as interruption to our operations and damage to our customer relationships and reputation. While we have information security policies, controls and systems in place in order to attempt to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information, there can be no assurance that such use or disclosure will not occur. Any compromise of the security of our information technology systems, or unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, could subject us to liability, regulatory scrutiny and action, damage to our reputation and customer relationships and could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.. We are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings.. We operate in highly regulated industries that are subject to a heightened risk of litigation and regulatory proceedings. We often are a party to material litigation and also are subject to legal and regulatory claims, assertions, actions, reviews, audits, inquiries and investigations. Increased scrutiny in the current regulatory environment could lead to new regulations and practices, new interpretations of existing regulations, as well as additional regulatory proceedings. Additional lawsuits, legal and regulatory proceedings and other matters may arise in the future. The outcome of these legal and regulatory proceedings and other matters could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restitutions or other relief which could require significant expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. See \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\". Resolution of our dispute with the IRS could adversely affect us.. We are contesting adjustments resulting from the examination by the IRS of our 2000 through 2007 consolidated federal income tax returns. The IRS opposes the recognition of certain tax losses and deductions that were generated through our investment in a portfolio of non-economic REMIC residual interests and has proposed denying the associated tax benefits of these items. We appealed these proposed adjustments to the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals and made \"qualified deposits\" with the U.S. Treasury of $85 million in June 2008 relating to the 2000 through 2004 tax years and $4 million in May 2010 relating to the 2005 through 2007 tax years in order to avoid the accrual of incremental above-market-rate interest with respect to the proposed adjustments.. In September 2014, we received Notices of Deficiency covering the 2000 through 2007 tax years that assert unpaid taxes and penalties of $157 million. The Deficiency Amount has not been reduced to reflect our NOL carryback ability. As of December 31, 2017, there also would be interest of approximately $149 million related to these matters. Depending on the outcome, additional state income taxes, penalties and interest (estimated in the aggregate to be approximately $37 million as of December 31, 2017) also may become due when a final resolution is reached. The Notices of Deficiency also reflected additional amounts due of $105 million, which are primarily associated with the disallowance of the previously filed carryback of our 2008 NOL to the 2006 and 2007 tax years. We believe that the disallowance of our 2008 NOL carryback is a precautionary position by the IRS and that we will ultimately maintain the benefit of this NOL carryback claim.. 60. Table of Contents. Glossary. Part 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________. On December 3, 2014, we petitioned the U.S. Tax Court (\"Tax Court\") to litigate the Deficiency Amount. During 2016, we held several meetings with the IRS in an attempt to reach a compromised settlement on the issues presented in our dispute. In October 2017, the parties informed the Tax Court that they believe they have reached agreement in principle on all issues in the dispute. In November 2017, as required by law, the agreement was reported to the JCT for review. The agreement cannot be finalized until the IRS considers the views, if any, expressed by the JCT about the matter. If we are unable to complete a compromised settlement, then the ongoing litigation could take several years to resolve and may result in substantial legal expenses. We can provide no assurance regarding the outcome of any such litigation or whether a compromised settlement with the IRS will ultimately be reached. We currently believe that an adequate provision for income taxes has been made for the potential liabilities that may result from this matter. However, if the ultimate resolution of this matter produces a result that differs materially from our current expectations, there could be a material impact on our effective tax rate, results of operations and cash flows.. Our ability to recognize benefits from our NOLs and other tax attributes may be limited.. We have in the past generated substantial NOLs and other tax attributes that can be used to reduce our future income tax obligations, much of which has been used in 2017 and previous years. We anticipate that our remaining federal NOL carryforwards as of December 31, 2017 (which were approximately $124.4 million) will be fully used during 2018. However, our ability to utilize our tax assets on a timely basis (i.e., to offset operating income as generated) will be adversely affected if we have an \"ownership change\" within the meaning of IRC Section 382. An ownership change is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point increase in equity ownership by \"five-percent shareholders\" (as that term is defined for purposes of IRC Section 382) over a rolling three-year period. While we have adopted the tax benefit preservation measures described below to protect our ability to use our NOLs and other tax assets, these measures may not prevent us from experiencing an ownership change, including as a result of the issuance of our common stock. Determining whether an \"ownership change\" has occurred is subject to uncertainty, both because of the complexity and ambiguity of IRC Section 382 and because of limitations on a publicly traded company's knowledge as to the ownership of, and transactions in, its securities. Therefore, even though we currently have several measures in place to protect our NOLs (such as the Plan, the Bylaw Amendment and the Charter Amendment described below), we cannot provide any assurance that the IRS or other taxing authority will not challenge the amount of our tax attributes or claim that we have experienced an \"ownership change\" and attempt to reduce the benefit of our tax assets. There is no guarantee that our tax benefit preservation measures will be effective in protecting our NOLs and other tax assets.. In 2009, we adopted a Tax Benefit Preservation Plan (the \"Plan\"), which, as amended, was approved by our stockholders at our 2010, 2013 and 2016 annual meetings. We also adopted certain amendments to our amended and restated bylaws (the \"Bylaw Amendment\") and at our 2010, 2013 and 2016 annual meetings, our stockholders approved certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the \"Charter Amendment\"). These steps were taken to protect our ability to utilize our NOLs and other tax assets and to attempt to prevent an \"ownership change\" under U.S. federal income tax rules by discouraging and, in most cases, restricting certain transfers of our common stock that would: (i) create or result in a person becoming a five-percent shareholder under IRC Section 382 or (ii) increase the stock ownership of any existing five-percent shareholder under IRC Section 382. The continued effectiveness of the Plan, the Bylaw Amendment and the Charter Amendment are subject to periodic examination by Radian Group's board of directors, including with respect to whether we have any remaining NOLs and other tax benefits that may be carried forward and whether the potential limitation on the use of the tax benefits under Section 382 remains material to the Company, and the Plan and Charter Amendment also remain subject to the reapproval of the Plan and the Charter Amendment by our stockholders every three years. We currently expect that our tax benefit preservation measures will be terminated no later than 2019 and, as a result, without the restrictions on transfer of our stock, we may be more susceptible to changes in ownership or takeover.. The final impacts of the TCJA could be materially different from our current assessment.. On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law. The TCJA significantly changes the U.S. tax system, and includes, among other things, a federal corporate tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. Because deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled, the enactment of the TCJA resulted in a material reduction of our net deferred tax assets.. 61. Table of Contents. Glossary. Part 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________. The measurement of certain of our deferred taxes was recorded provisionally, and may be adjusted within the next year. Although the decrease in the federal statutory income tax rate pursuant to the TCJA resulted in a one-time reduction in the amount at which our deferred tax asset is recorded, thereby reducing our net income and book value in the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJA also reduces our effective income tax rate for periods beginning January 1, 2018, which we expect to increase net income and book value in future periods. Additional changes or interpretations in the current tax laws may also impact our net income and book value in future periods. The ultimate impact of the TCJA may differ from our provisional estimates due to, among other things, future guidance that may be issued, changes in our interpretation or assumptions with respect to reversal periods, the outcome of our potential settlement of the IRS Matter and future actions that we may take as a result of the new tax law, which could have a material adverse effect on our tax obligations, results of operations and financial condition.. Legislation and administrative and regulatory changes and interpretations could impact our businesses.. Our businesses are subject to and may be impacted by many federal and state lending, insurance and consumer laws and regulations and may be affected by changes in these laws and regulations or the way they are interpreted or applied. In particular, our businesses may be significantly impacted by the following:. • legislation, administrative or regulatory action impacting the charters or business practices of the GSEs;. • reform of the U.S. housing finance system;. • legislation and regulation impacting the FHA and its competitive position versus private mortgage insurers;. • state insurance laws and regulations that address, among other items, licensing of companies to transact business, claims handling, reinsurance requirements, premium rates, policy forms offered to customers and requirements for Risk-to-capital, minimum policyholder positions, reserves (including contingency reserves), surplus, reinsurance and payment of dividends;. • the application of state, federal or private sector programs aimed at supporting borrowers and the housing market;. • the application of RESPA, the FCRA and other laws to our businesses;. • the amendments to Regulation AB (commonly referred to as Regulation AB II) that were adopted by the SEC and introduce several new requirements related to public offerings of ABS, including public offerings of RMBS for which our Services business traditionally has provided due diligence and servicer surveillance services and new credit rating agency reform rules (the \"NRSRO Rules\") adopted by the SEC that include requirements applicable to providers of third-party due diligence services, such as our Services business, for both publicly and privately issued ABS;. • the interpretation and application of the TRID rules requiring enhanced disclosures to consumers in connection with the origination of residential mortgage loans;. • new federal standards and oversight for mortgage insurers, including as a result of the recommendation of the Federal Insurance Office of the U.S. Treasury that federal standards and oversight for mortgage insurers be developed and implemented;. • the implementation of new regulations under, or the potential repeal or amendment of provisions of, the Dodd-Frank Act; and. • the implementation in the U.S. of the Basel III capital adequacy guidelines.. See \"Item 1. Business - Regulation.\". Any of the items discussed above could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects. In addition, our businesses could be impacted by new legislation or regulations, as well as changes to existing legislation or regulations or the way they are interpreted or applied, that are not currently contemplated and which could occur at any time.. 62. Table of Contents. Glossary. Part 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________. The implementation of the Basel III guidelines may discourage the use of mortgage insurance.. Over the past few decades, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the \"Basel Committee\") has established international benchmarks for assessing banks' capital adequacy requirements. Included within those benchmarks are capital standards related to residential lending and securitization activity and importantly for private mortgage insurers, the capital treatment of mortgage insurance on those loans. These benchmarks are then interpreted and implemented via rulemaking by U.S. banking regulators. In July 2013, the U.S. banking regulators promulgated regulations to implement significant elements of the Basel framework, referred to as the \"Basel III Rules.\" The Basel III Rules, among other things, revise and enhance the U.S. banking agencies' general risk-based capital rules. Today, the Basel III Rules assign a 50% or 100% risk weight to loans secured by one-to-four-family residential properties. Generally, residential mortgage exposures secured by a first lien on a one-to-four family residential property that are prudently underwritten and that are performing according to their original terms receive a 50% risk weighting. All other one-to-four family residential mortgage loans are assigned a 100% risk weight.. In December 2014, the Basel Committee issued a proposal for further revisions to Basel III. It proposed adjustments to the risk weights for residential mortgage exposures that take into account LTV and the borrower's ability to service a mortgage. The proposed LTV ratio did not take into consideration any credit enhancement, including private mortgage insurance. The comment period for this proposal closed in March 2015, and in December 2015, the Basel Committee released a second proposal that retained the LTV provisions of the initial draft, but not the debt servicing coverage ratios (the \"2015 Proposal\"). The comment period for the 2015 Proposal closed in March 2016. In March 2015, the U.S. banking regulators clarified that LTV ratios can account for credit enhancement such as private mortgage insurance in determining whether a loan is made in accordance with prudent underwriting standards for purposes of receiving the preferred 50% risk weight.. The revised, and final recommendations from the Basel Committee, which were published in December 2017, finalized risk weighting guidelines for residential mortgage exposures. These rules only recognize guarantees provided by sovereign governments (such as FHA, VA, USDA and Ginnie Mae) as off-setting the capital requirements, which means that the credit enhancement provided by third-party private mortgage insurance and the GSEs have higher risk weightings, putting loans insured by private mortgage insurance at a disadvantage to the government guaranteed products. It remains unclear whether new guidelines will be proposed or finalized in the United States in response to the most recent Basel III recommendations. If the federal regulators decide to change the rules in response to the final Basel III recommendations and introduce LTV sensitivity to the calculation of necessary capital, it would reduce or eliminate the capital benefit banks receive from insuring low down payment loans with private mortgage insurance and could adversely affect our business and business prospects.. In addition, the Basel III Rules applicable to general credit risk mitigation for banking exposures provide that insurance companies engaged predominantly in the business of providing credit protection, such as private mortgage insurance companies, are not eligible guarantors, which could affect our business prospects.. We rely on our management team and our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain qualified personnel or successfully develop and/or recruit their replacements.. Our success depends, in part, on the skills, working relationships and continued services of our management team and other key personnel, any of whom could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. The unexpected departure of key personnel could adversely affect the conduct of our business. In such event, we would be required to obtain other personnel to manage and operate our business. In addition, we will be required to replace the knowledge and expertise of our workforce as our workers retire. In either case, there can be no assurance that we would be able to develop or recruit suitable replacements for the departing individuals, that replacements could be hired, if necessary, on terms that are favorable to us, or that we can successfully transition such replacements in a timely manner. Failure to effectively implement our succession planning efforts and to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving members of our management team and other key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Without a properly skilled and experienced workforce, our costs, including productivity costs and costs to replace employees may increase, and this could negatively impact our earnings.. We may make investments to grow our existing businesses, pursue new lines of business or new business initiatives, acquire other companies or engage in other strategic initiatives, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties.. In support of our growth strategy, we may make strategic investments, acquisitions or pursue other strategic initiatives that expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that include, without limitation:. • the use of capital and potential diversion of other resources, such as the diversion of management's attention from our core businesses and potential disruption of those businesses;. 63. Table of Contents. Glossary. Part 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________. • the assumption of liabilities in connection with any strategic investment, including any acquired business;. • our ability to comply with additional regulatory requirements associated with new products, services, lines of business, or other business or strategic initiatives;. • our ability to successfully integrate or develop the operations of any new business initiative or acquisition;. • the possibility that we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or other strategic investment or initiative, including expected synergies, cost savings, or sales or growth opportunities, within the anticipated timeframe or at all; and. • the possibility that we may fail to achieve forecasted results for a strategic investment, acquisition or other initiative that could result in lower or negative earnings contribution and/or impairment charges associated with intangible assets acquired.. We face risks associated with our Services business.. We expanded our business to include our Services segment through our 2014 acquisition of Clayton and our subsequent acquisitions of Red Bell and ValuAmerica. Our Services business exposes us to certain risks that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition, including, among others, the following:. • Our Services revenue is dependent on a limited number of large customers that represent a significant proportion of our Services total revenues. The loss or reduction of business from one or more of these significant customers could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. In addition, Radian Guaranty does business with many of these significant customers. In the event of a dispute between a significant customer and either of our business segments, the overall customer relationship for Radian could be negatively impacted.. • While Clayton is not a defendant in litigation arising out of the financial crisis involving the issuance of RMBS in connection with which it has provided services, it has in the past, and may again in the future, receive subpoenas from various parties to provide documents and information related to such litigation, and there can be no assurance that Clayton will not be subject to future claims against it, whether in connection with such litigation or otherwise. It is possible that our exposure to potential liabilities resulting from our Services business, some of which may be material or unknown, could exceed amounts we can recover through indemnification claims.. • A significant portion of our Services engagements are transactional in nature and may be performed in connection with securitizations, loan sales, loan purchases or other transactions. Due to the transactional nature of our business, our Services segment revenues are subject to fluctuation from period to period and are difficult to predict.. • Sales of our mortgage and real estate services are influenced by the level of overall activity in the mortgage, real estate and mortgage finance markets generally, and are specifically dependent on the mortgage loan origination volumes of our customers which may fluctuate from period to period. If mortgage origination volumes decline we could experience less demand for our mortgage and real estate services.. • Red Bell is a licensed real estate brokerage and provides real estate brokerage services in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a licensed real estate brokerage, Red Bell receives residential real estate information from various multiple listing services (\"MLS\"). Red Bell receives this information, which it uses in its business to broker real estate transactions and provide valuation products and services, pursuant to the terms of agreements with the MLS providers. If these agreements were to terminate or Red Bell otherwise loses access to this information, it could negatively impact Red Bell's ability to conduct its business."
