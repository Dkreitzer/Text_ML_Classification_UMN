[1] "Item 1A.  Risk Factors.. You should carefully consider the risk factors described below and other information contained in this Form 10-K.  If any of the following risk factors, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently believe are not material, actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and you may lose all or a significant part of your investment.. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry. Numerous political and regulatory authorities, along with well-funded environmental activist groups, are devoting substantial resources to anti-coal activities to minimize or eliminate the use of coal as a source of electricity generation, domestically and internationally, thereby further reducing the demand and pricing for coal, including PRB coal, and potentially materially and adversely impacting our future financial results, liquidity and growth prospects.. Concerns about the environmental impacts of coal combustion, including perceived impacts on global climate issues, are resulting in increased regulation of coal combustion in many jurisdictions, unfavorable lending policies by government-backed lending institutions and development banks toward the financing of new overseas coal-fueled power plants and divestment efforts affecting the investment community, which could significantly affect demand for our products or our securities. Global climate issues continue to attract public and scientific attention. Numerous reports, such as the Fourth and Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have also engendered concern about the impacts of human activity, especially fossil fuel combustion, on global climate issues. In turn, increasing government attention is being paid to global climate issues and to emissions of GHGs, including emissions of carbon dioxide from coal combustion by power plants. The 2015 Paris climate summit agreement resulted in voluntary commitments by numerous countries to reduce their GHG emissions, and could result in additional firm commitments by various nations with respect to future GHG emissions.  These commitments could further disfavor coal-fired generation, particularly in the medium- to long-term.. Enactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the combustion of coal by the United States, some of its states or other countries, or other actions to limit such emissions, could also result in electricity generators further switching from coal to other fuel sources or additional coal-fueled power plant closures.  Further, policies limiting available financing for the development of new coal-fueled power plants could adversely impact the global demand for coal in the future.. There have also been efforts in recent years affecting the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves.  In California, for example, legislation was signed into law in October 2015 that required California's state pension funds to divest investments in companies that generate 50% or more of their revenue from coal mining by July 2017.  More recently, in December 2017, the Governor of New York announced that the New York Common Fund will immediately cease all new investments in entities with \"significant fossil fuel activities,\" and the World Bank announced that it will no longer finance upstream oil and gas after 2019, except in \"exceptional circumstances.\"  Other activist campaigns have urged banks to cease financing coal-driven businesses.  As a result, numerous major banks have enacted such policies.  The impact of such efforts may adversely affect the demand for and price of securities issued by us, and impact our access to the capital and financial markets.. 21. Table of Contents. Additional regulatory developments have been oriented at increasing the regulatory burden associated with mining coal and coal-fired generation.  Regulatory initiatives proposed, adopted, or enacted in the United States by previous administrations include: the MATS rule, the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants boiler rules, the new source performance standards for fossil-fuel fired power plants, revisions to the nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide NAAQS, the CAIR rule, the Clean Power Plan, the regional haze program, regulation of CCR, revisions to the Corps' Section 404 permitting regime, and OSM's stream protection rule. See Item 1 \"Business - Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters.\"   Although the current administration is seeking to unwind many of these initiatives including through a series of executive orders and new regulations, any such actions are subject to judicial review in which the current administration may not prevail, and a future administration may adopt a different approach and pursue further rulemakings to undo or revise any such regulations. These and other governmental actions that directly or indirectly affect the coal mining industry and coal-fired power generation have made, and will continue to make, it more difficult and costly to mine and ship coal, and operate coal-fired assets.  Meanwhile, substantial government subsidies are available to fund various aspects of renewable power generation and supply, which may hurt our ability to compete against these alternative forms of electric generation.. In addition, several well-funded, non-governmental organizations have explicitly undertaken campaigns to minimize or eliminate the use of coal as a source of electricity generation.  For example, the goals of Sierra Club's \"Beyond Coal\" campaign include retiring one-third of the nation's coal-fired power plants by 2020, replacing retired coal plants with \"clean energy solutions,\" and \"keeping coal in the ground.\"  It has been reported that the Beyond Coal campaign has been funded by several high-profile, high-net-worth individuals and organizations, including approximately $80 million from Michael Bloomberg and his philanthropic foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies.  In an effort to stop or delay coal mining activities, the Sierra Club and other activist groups have brought, and continue to bring, numerous lawsuits, including against the BLM to challenge not only the issuance of individual coal leases, but also the federal coal leasing program more broadly.  Other lawsuits continue to be brought challenging historical and pending regulatory approvals, permits and processes that are necessary to conduct coal mining operations or to operate coal-fueled power plants, including so-called \"sue and settle\" lawsuits where regulatory authorities in the past have reached private agreements with environmental activists that often involve additional regulatory restrictions or processes being implemented without formal rulemaking.. The net effect of these and other similar developments is to make it more costly and difficult to maintain our business and to continue to depress demand and pricing for our coal.  A substantial or extended decline in the prices we receive for our coal due to these or other factors could further reduce our revenue and profitability, cash flows, liquidity, and value of our coal reserves and result in losses.. Coal prices are subject to change based on a number of factors and thermal coal prices are currently depressed.  If thermal coal prices remain depressed, or if there is a substantial or extended decline in prices, it could materially reduce our revenue and profitability, cash flows, liquidity, and value of our coal reserves and result in losses.. Our revenue, results of operations, and the value of our coal reserves depend on the prices we receive for our coal and logistics services.  Over the last several years, prices for thermal coal have become more volatile and depressed due to an oversupply of coal and significantly reduced demand in the U.S. and various other countries.  The prices we receive for our coal and logistics services depend upon factors beyond our control, including:.                   domestic and foreign supply and demand for coal, including Asian and other foreign demand for PRB coal exports, and the impact of domestic and foreign government environmental, energy and tax policies and currency exchange rate fluctuations;.                   domestic and foreign demand for electricity and steel;.                   domestic and foreign economic conditions;.                   the quantity, quality, and price of coal available from domestic and foreign competitors, including coal re-sellers and traders;.                   competition for production of electricity from non-coal sources, including the price and availability of alternative fuels, such as natural gas and crude oil, and alternative energy sources, such as nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar power, and the effects of technological developments related to these non-coal and alternative energy sources;.                   adverse weather, climatic or other natural conditions, including natural disasters;. 22. Table of Contents.                   legislative, regulatory and judicial developments, environmental regulatory changes, or changes in energy and tax policy and energy conservation measures that would adversely affect the coal or utility industries, such as legislation or regulation that limits carbon dioxide or sulfur dioxide emissions or provides for increased funding, subsidies or other incentives for, or mandates the use of, alternative energy sources to address climate change;.                   shareholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the use of coal;.                   domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, including with respect to air emission standards for coal-fired power plants, and the ability of coal-fired power plants to economically meet these standards;.                   changes in coal-fired power plant capacity and utilization, including the extent to which new coal plants are built in the United States and other countries;.                   market price fluctuations for sulfur dioxide emission allowances;.                   the capacity of, cost of, and proximity to, rail transportation and terminal facilities and rail and terminal performance; and.                   the other risks described in this Item 1A.. If thermal coal prices remain depressed, or if there is a substantial or extended decline in the prices we receive for our coal and logistics services due to these or other factors, it could materially reduce our revenue and profitability, cash flows, liquidity, and value of our coal reserves and result in losses.. Competition with domestic and foreign coal producers, with traders and re-sellers of coal and with producers of natural gas and other competing energy sources may continue to negatively affect our sales volumes and our ability to sell coal at a favorable price.. The coal industry is highly competitive.  We compete with other domestic and many foreign coal producers, with traders and re-sellers of coal and with other energy producers throughout the U.S. and, for our export sales, internationally.  In addition to the price of coal, coal quality, and transportation costs, demand for coal also has a significant impact on our ability to compete domestically and internationally for coal sales.  Demand for coal depends upon a number of factors, including:.                   general economic conditions and weather patterns, both of which are significant contributors to the demand for electricity;.                   delivered prices for coal, including the relative costs of transportation, such as ocean freight rates, from our mine site and competing mines or supplies of coal;.                   availability and cost of alternative fuel sources, such as natural gas;.                   technological developments;.                   environmental, tax, and other governmental policies and regulations, including EPA regulations; and.                   currency exchange rate fluctuations impacting our export sales.. Demand for U.S. coal has fluctuated over the last decade because of these and other factors and, in recent years, has declined substantially due to global climate change initiatives and other regulatory initiatives that favor natural gas or non-fossil fuel sources of electricity generation, sustained low natural gas prices in the United States, weak global economic conditions and other factors, including those described in this Item 1A.  A decline in domestic demand for coal, or a decline in foreign demand for U.S. coal, has caused, and could continue to cause, additional significant competition among coal producers and downward pressure on coal prices.  Furthermore, overcapacity and increased production in the future, similar to the activities that occurred during the mid-1970s and early 1980s, could result in additional production capacity throughout the industry, causing increased competition and lower coal prices, materially reducing our revenue, profitability, cash flows, and liquidity.. 23. Table of Contents. In addition to competing with other coal producers, we compete generally with producers of other fuels, such as natural gas.  A decline in the price of natural gas has made natural gas more competitive against coal and resulted in utilities switching from coal to natural gas.  Sustained low natural gas prices may also cause utilities to continue to phase out or close existing coal-fired power plants or reduce or eliminate construction of any new coal-fired power plants, which could have a material adverse effect on demand and prices received for our coal.. Government action requiring the use and dispatch of alternative energy sources and fuels or providing financing or incentives to encourage continuing technological advances and deployment in this area could further enable alternative energy sources to become more competitive with coal.  If alternative energy sources, such as hydroelectric, wind or solar, continue to become more cost-competitive, demand for coal could decrease and cause a decrease in the price of coal.. If we do not grow our longer term logistics revenue and export sales at favorable prices, we may incur losses in our logistics business and be subject to significant take-or-pay commitments.. Our ability to grow our export sales revenue and logistics margins depends on a number of factors, including the price we receive for our coal and our logistics services, the existence of sufficient and cost-effective export terminal capacity for the shipment of thermal coal to foreign customers, and demand by customers in Asia and in other potential export destinations for PRB coal.. International customer demand for PRB coal, and the prices those customers may be willing to pay for PRB coal and related transportation services provided by our logistics business, can be affected by a variety of factors, including supplier diversity and security considerations, economic conditions and demand for electricity in the relevant locations, international energy and tax policies and regulatory requirements, and availability and pricing for thermal coal delivered from alternative international coal basins.  Further, our export sales are priced relative to various international coal indices adjusted for energy content and other quality and delivery criteria.  These indices are volatile and heavily influenced by Chinese and Indian thermal coal import demand.  For example, over the last five years, Newcastle prices have varied from a high of $109.69 per tonne to a low of $47.37 per tonne.  Similarly, Kalimantan 5000 prices have varied from a high of $77.00 per tonne to a low of $36.80 per tonne.  Fluctuations in these indices may be affected by a wide range of international supply and demand factors, including those listed above.  Our export sales may also be negatively impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations that make coal from other countries more economical than PRB coal and provide competitive advantages to non-U.S. producers when the U.S. dollar is strong in comparison to those foreign currencies.  For example, the Newcastle and Kalimantan 5000 benchmark price indices are denominated in U.S. dollars.  If demand for exports declines or we are unable to secure a favorable price for the export of our coal and logistics services, our cash flows, profitability, liquidity, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.. At present, there is limited terminal capacity for the export of PRB coal to foreign destinations.  Our access to existing and any future terminal capacity, including the proposed MBT in which we have an option for potential future capacity, may be adversely affected by regulatory and permit requirements, environmental and other legal challenges, public perceptions and resulting political pressures, operational issues at terminals and competition among North American coal producers for access to limited terminal capacity, among other factors.  If we fail to maintain terminal capacity, or are denied access to existing or any future terminals for the export of our coal on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, our results from our future export transactions will be materially adversely affected.. In addition, we have significant multi-year take-or-pay contracts for rail and terminal capacity related to our logistics services for export sales.  These contracts require us to pay for a minimum quantity of coal to be transported on the railway or through the terminal regardless of whether we sell any coal or the prices we receive for our coal or logistics services.  If we fail to make sufficient export sales to meet our minimum obligations under these take-or-pay contracts, we are still obligated to make payments to the railway or terminal, which could have a negative impact on our cash flows, profitability and results of operations.  As of December 31, 2017, we had take-or-pay commitments of $45.7 million that could be potentially payable if we fail to meet our minimum shipment obligations.  See Item 7 - \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Contractual Obligations.\". The regulatory environment may also adversely impact our logistics business and future export sales.  For example, the ONRR previously finalized changes to how coal royalties are calculated for sales to affiliated entities, which could have adversely impacted export sales for vertically integrated mining and logistics entities, such as our logistics business, and placed vertically integrated entities at a competitive disadvantage compared to independent coal brokers.  Moreover, the ONRR proposal included a so-called \"default provision\", which would have created further uncertainty as to how the ONRR would apply its proposed royalty rules to our export sales.  We, along with other energy industry companies and trade associations, filed litigation to challenge this ONRR rule.  The current administration delayed the effective date of the rule in. 24. Table of Contents. February 2017 before ultimately rescinding the rule in August 2017. The states of California and New Mexico have filed a legal challenge to the rescission of the ONRR rule in a federal district court in California and are seeking the reinstatement of the rule formerly adopted by the Obama administration.  Should the plaintiffs prevail in this litigation and obtain an order vacating the rescission of the ONRR rule, or should a similar rule be promulgated by this or a future administration, our business and revenues may be adversely affected.. Our long-term growth may be materially adversely impacted if economic, commercially available carbon capture technology for power plants is not developed and adopted in a timely manner.. Federal or state laws or regulations may be adopted that would impose new or additional limits on the emissions of GHGs, including, but not limited to, CO2 from electric generating units using fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas.  In order to comply with such regulations, electric generating units using fossil fuels may be required to implement carbon capture technology.  For example, in October 2015, the EPA released a rule that establishes, for the first time, new source performance standards under the federal Clean Air Act for CO2 emissions from new fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating power plants.  The EPA has designated partial carbon capture and sequestration as the best system of emission reduction for newly constructed fossil fuel-fired steam generating units at power plants to employ to meet the standard.  However, there is a risk that such technology, which may include storage, conversion, or other commercial use for captured carbon, may not be commercially practical in limiting emissions as otherwise required by the proposed rule or similar rules that may be proposed in the future.  If such legislative or regulatory programs are adopted, and economic, commercially available carbon capture technology for power plants is not developed or adopted in a timely manner, it would negatively affect our customers and would further reduce the demand for coal as a fuel source, causing coal prices and sales of our coal to decline, perhaps materially.. As a result of ongoing depressed industry conditions and previous coal producer bankruptcy filings, the coal industry has experienced increased credit pressures that could result in demands for credit support by third parties or decisions by banks, surety bond providers, investors or other companies to reduce or eliminate their exposure to the coal industry, including our company.  These credit pressures could materially and adversely impact our liquidity and ability to meet our regulatory requirements.. Ongoing depressed industry conditions and previous coal producer bankruptcy filings have resulted in increased credit pressures on the coal industry.  These credit pressures include, for example, (a) vendors, suppliers, customers and other commercial counterparties seeking prepayments, security deposits, letters of credit and other credit protections, and (b) banks, surety bond providers, investors and other companies reducing or eliminating their exposure to the coal industry.  Although some of these credit pressures may be company-specific, many are directed to the coal industry in general due to the current overall negative investor sentiment toward the industry.  Any credit demands by third parties or refusals by banks, surety bond providers, investors or others to extend, renew or refinance credit on commercially reasonable terms may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.  In some cases, such as any collateral requirements imposed by surety bond providers to issue surety bonds that secure our future performance under various federal and state laws, our ability to meet regulatory requirements may also be adversely impacted if we are not able to satisfy cash or other collateral requirements.  As of December 31, 2017, there were approximately $422.9 million in third-party surety bonds outstanding to primarily secure the performance of our reclamation and lease obligations.. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by unfavorable global or U.S. economic and market conditions.. In recent years, the global economic downturn, particularly with respect to the U.S. economy and various European and Asian economies, and global financial and credit market disruptions had a negative impact on us and the coal industry generally.  For example, the economic downturn in recent years has negatively impacted electricity demand and led to an oversupply of thermal coal and depressed prices.. Furthermore, because we typically seek to enter into long-term arrangements for the sale of a substantial portion of our coal, the average sales price we receive for our coal may lag behind any general economic recovery.  Future economic downturns or further disruptions in the financial and credit markets could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.. 25. Table of Contents. Decreases in U.S. and global demand for electricity due to economic, weather or other conditions could negatively affect coal prices.. Our coal customers primarily use our coal as fuel for electricity generation.  Overall economic activity and the associated demands for power by industrial users can have significant effects on overall electricity demand and can be caused by a number of factors.  An economic slowdown can significantly slow the growth of electricity demand and could result in reduced demand for coal.  For example, declines in the rate of international economic growth in countries such as China, India or other developing countries could further negatively impact the demand for U.S. coal and result in a continuing oversupply of coal.  Weather patterns can also greatly affect electricity demand.  Extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, cause increased power usage and, therefore, increase generating requirements from all sources.  Mild temperatures, on the other hand, result in lower electrical demand, which allows generators to choose the sources of power generation when deciding which generation sources to dispatch.  For example, the unusually warm winter of 2015/2016 led to low natural gas heating demand at a time of high gas production.  This in turn led to low natural gas prices and substitution of gas for coal.  When gas prices rose, this substitution of PRB coal decreased, but not enough to offset the increased utility coal stockpiles during this period, which lead to a reduction in utility coal contracting and depressed thermal coal prices.  Decreases in coal demand for these or other reasons could cause further downward pressure on coal prices and would negatively impact our results of operations.. Our coal mining operations are subject to operating risks, which could result in materially increased operating expenses and decreased production levels.. We mine coal at surface mining operations located in Wyoming and Montana.  Our coal mining operations are subject to a number of operating risks.  These operating risks include, among others:.                   poor mining conditions resulting from geological, hydrologic, ground or other conditions, which may cause instability of highwalls or spoil-piles or cause damage to nearby infrastructure such as roads, power lines, railways and gas pipelines;.                   critical mining and plant equipment failures, unexpected maintenance problems or damage from fire, flooding or other events;.                   adverse weather and natural disasters, such as heavy rains, flooding, droughts, dust and other natural events affecting operations, transportation or customers;.                   the unavailability of raw materials, equipment (including heavy mobile equipment) or other critical supplies such as tires and explosives, fuel, lubricants and other consumables of the type, quantity and/or size needed to meet production expectations;.                   the capacity of, and proximity to, rail transportation facilities and rail transportation delays or interruptions, including derailments;.                   competition and/or conflicts with other natural resource extraction activities and production within our operating areas, such as coalbed methane extraction or oil and gas development; and.                   a major incident at a mine site that causes all or part of the operations of a mine to cease for some period of time.. Because we maintain very little produced coal inventory, disruptions in our operations due to these or other risks could negatively impact or even halt production and shipments, significantly increase the cost of mining and impact our ability to meet our contractual obligations to customers and others, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  We maintain insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some of these risks, although there can be no assurance regarding the extent, if any, to which these risks would be covered by our insurance policies.. The availability and reliability of sufficient transportation capacity and increases in transportation costs could materially adversely affect the demand for our coal or impair our ability to supply coal to our domestic and export customers.. Transportation costs represent a significant portion of the total cost of coal for our domestic and export customers.  The cost and availability of transportation is a key factor in a customer's purchasing decision and impacts our coal sales and the price we receive for our coal.  Coal could become a less competitive source of energy if the costs of transportation. 26. Table of Contents. increase or the availability or capacity of rail lines or export terminals is insufficient.  Transportation costs and availability could also make our coal less competitive than coal produced from other regions.. Our ability to sell coal to our customers depends primarily upon third-party rail systems and export terminals.  If our customers are unable to obtain transportation services, or to do so on a cost-effective basis, our business and growth strategy could be adversely affected.  Alternative transportation and delivery systems are generally inadequate and not suitable to handle the quantity of our shipments or to ensure timely delivery to our customers.  Existing and proposed export terminals are also subject to permit requirements and challenges from environmental organizations which may make it complicated or expensive to expand existing terminal capacity or open new export terminals in a timely and cost-effective manner.  In addition, much of the PRB is served by two rail carriers, and the Northern PRB is only serviced by one rail carrier.  The loss of sufficient and reliable access to rail capacity in the PRB, as we have experienced in recent years, could create disruption until this access was restored; significantly impairing our ability to supply coal and resulting in materially decreased revenue.  Similarly, being denied access to an export terminal could significantly affect our future export sales, materially decreasing our logistics revenue and growth opportunities.  Our ability to open new mines or expand existing mines may also be affected by the access to, and availability and cost of rail, export terminal or other transportation systems available for servicing these mines.. Typically, our mine customers contract and pay directly for transportation of coal from the mine or port to the point of use.  However, for contracts with our logistics customers, we are required to enter into transportation agreements pursuant to which we arrange and pay for all rail transport, terminal, and for our international customers, demurrage charges.  As the volume of deliveries coordinated to customer contracted destinations increases, so do our costs and risks.  Our ability to supply coal to our customers and our customers' ability to take our coal may be impacted by the disruption of these transportation services because of weather-related problems; mechanical difficulties; maintenance shut-downs; environmental, political and regulatory issues; train derailment; bridge or structural concerns; infrastructure damage, whether caused by ground instability, accidents or otherwise; strikes; lock-outs; lack of fuel or maintenance items; fuel costs; accidents; terrorism or domestic catastrophe or other events.  For example, in the spring and summer of 2011, the Midwest region experienced severe flooding which disrupted rail service to mines in the PRB and affected the ability of those customers who were impacted by the flooding to take coal deliveries.  During 2014, we also experienced rail interruptions due to increased competition for rail crews from crude oil and grain shipments, which negatively impacted our shipments and financial results.  Any similar disruption in the future could negatively impact our results of operations.  In addition, some scientists have opined that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur in areas where we or our clients operate, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.. If we are unable to acquire or develop additional coal reserves that are economically recoverable, our future profitability may be reduced and our future success and growth may be significantly impacted.. Our profitability depends substantially on our ability to mine, in a timely and cost-effective manner, coal reserves that possess the quality characteristics our customers' desire.  Because our reserves decline as we mine our coal, our future success and growth depend upon our ability to acquire additional coal that is economically recoverable.  We primarily acquire additional coal through the federal competitive leasing process, but we also enter into state and private coal leases as well as acquire coal from private third parties.  If we fail to acquire or develop additional reserves, our existing reserves will eventually be depleted.  Our ability to obtain additional coal reserves in the future could also be limited by a number of factors, any of which could impact our business and growth strategy, including:.                   the availability of cash we generate from our operations;.                   available financing and restrictions under our debt instruments;.                   competition from other coal companies for properties;.                   lack of suitable acquisition or LBA opportunities;.                   delays or changes in the federal leasing process due to third-party legal challenges, regulatory developments or climate change initiatives; or.                   the inability to acquire coal properties or federal coal leases on commercially reasonable terms.. 27. Table of Contents. Any significant delay in acquiring reserves could negatively impact our production rate.  We will need to acquire additional coal reserves that can be mined on an economically recoverable basis to maintain our production capacity and competitive position.  We may be unable to mine future reserves at profitability levels achieved at times in the past.  The price we receive for our coal also impacts how economically we can recover our existing coal.  Our ability to develop economically recoverable reserves will be materially adversely impacted if prices for thermal coal sold remain depressed or decrease significantly.. Because most of the coal in the vicinity of our mines is owned by the U.S. federal government, our future success and growth would be affected if we are unable to acquire or are significantly delayed in the acquisition of additional reserves through the federal competitive leasing process, including due to third party legal challenges or changes in the federal coal leasing program.. The U.S. federal government owns most of the coal in the vicinity of our mines.  Accordingly, the federal competitive leasing process is our primary means of acquiring additional reserves.  There is no requirement that the federal government must lease its coal or give preference to any LBA applicant, which means our bids for federal coal leases may compete with other coal producers' bids.  Federal coal leases are expensive to obtain and the review process to submit an LBA for bid continues to lengthen.  We expect this trend to continue.  The size of potential LBA tracts may also make it easier for new mining operators to enter the market on economic terms and may, therefore, further increase competition for federal coal leases.  In order to win a lease in the LBA process and acquire additional coal, our bid for a coal tract must meet or exceed the fair market value of the coal based on the internal estimates of the BLM, which are not published.  Any failure or delay in acquiring a coal lease through the LBA process, or the inability to do so on economic terms, could cause our production to decline, materially adversely affecting our business, cash flows and results of operations.. Increased opposition from non-governmental organizations and other third parties may also lengthen, delay or adversely impact the LBA process, which may result in difficulties in obtaining leases or impact our ability to mine the coal subject to those leases and/or delay our access to mine the coal.  See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion regarding certain challenges by environmental activist groups against potential lease modifications and other regulatory processes relating to our mines.. The LBA process also requires us to acquire rights to mine from certain surface owners overlying the coal before the federal government will agree to lease the coal.  Surface rights in the PRB are becoming increasingly more difficult and costly to acquire.  Certain federal regulations provide a specific class of surface owners, also known as QSO, with the ability to prohibit the BLM from leasing its coal.  For example, in connection with an LBA that we previously nominated for our Cordero Rojo Mine, the BLM indicated that certain surface owners satisfy the regulatory definition of QSO.  If a QSO owns the land overlying a coal tract, federal laws prohibit us from leasing the coal tract without first securing surface rights to the land, or purchasing the surface rights from the QSO.  This right of QSOs allows them to exercise significant influence over negotiations to acquire surface rights and can delay the LBA process or ultimately prevent the acquisition of coal underlying their surface.  If we are unable to successfully negotiate access rights with QSOs at a price and on terms acceptable to us, we may be unable to acquire federal coal leases on land owned by the QSO.  Our profitability could be materially adversely affected if the prices to acquire land owned by QSOs increase.. If we are unable to acquire surface rights to access our coal, we may be unable to obtain a permit or otherwise be unable to mine coal we own and may be required to employ expensive techniques to mine around those sections of land we cannot access in order to access other sections of coal reserves.. After we acquire coal, we are required to obtain a permit to mine the coal through the applicable state agencies before we are allowed to begin mining.  In part, the permitting requirements provide that, under certain circumstances, we must obtain surface owner consent if the surface estate has been split from the mineral estate, which is commonly known as a \"split estate.\" We have in the past and may in the future be required to negotiate with multiple parties for the surface access that overlies coal we acquired.  If we are unable to successfully negotiate surface access with any of these surface owners, or do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may be denied a permit to mine some of the coal we have acquired or may find that we cannot mine the coal at a profit or at all.  If we are denied a permit, this would create significant delays and restrictions in our mining operations and materially adversely impact our business and results of operations.  Furthermore, if we determine to alter our plans to mine around the affected areas, we could incur significant additional costs to do so, which could increase our operating expenses considerably and could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  Failure to successfully negotiate access for surface rights overlying coal that we control in a timely manner may also result in significant accounting charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.. 28.

Defects in title or the loss of a leasehold interest in, or superior or conflicting property rights impacting, reserves or surface rights could limit our ability to mine our coal reserves and adversely impact our operations and costs.. A title defect on any lease, whether private or through a governmental entity, or the surface rights related to any of our reserves could adversely affect our ability to mine the associated coal reserves.  Consistent with industry practice, we conduct only limited investigations of title to our coal properties prior to leasing.  Title to properties leased from private third parties is not usually fully verified until we make a commitment to develop a property, which may not occur until we have obtained the necessary permits and completed exploration of the property. Title or other defects in surface rights held by us or other third parties could impair our ability to mine the associated coal reserves or cause us to incur unanticipated costs.. In addition, these leasehold interests may be subject to superior property rights of other third parties.  The federal government leases many different mineral rights in addition to coal, such as coalbed methane, natural gas and crude oil rights.  Some of these minerals are located on, or are adjacent to, some of our coal and LBA areas, potentially creating conflicting interests between us and the lessees of those interests and may affect our ability to operate as planned if our title is not superior or cost-effective arrangements cannot be timely negotiated.  We are regularly in negotiations with third parties in an effort to address potentially conflicting mineral development.  These negotiations may not be effective.  In that event, our mine plans, future costs and production rates may be adversely impacted.  Anticipated oil and gas development is expected to continue to increase the frequency of these potential conflicts.. Further, the majority of our coal interests are acquired by lease from state or federal governments.  If any of our leases are terminated, for lack of diligent development or otherwise, we would be unable to mine the affected coal and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.. We may not recover our investments in our mining, exploration, port access rights, development projects, and other assets, which may require us to recognize impairment charges related to those assets.. The value of our assets may be adversely affected by numerous uncertain factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:.                   unfavorable changes in the economic environments in which we operate;.                   unfavorable regulatory or legal developments impacting our industry;.                   lower-than-expected domestic and international demand and coal pricing;.                   technical and geological operating difficulties;.                   an inability to economically extract our coal reserves;.                   unanticipated increases in operating costs;.                   disputes or difficulties with counterparties for our development projects; and.                   an inability to obtain additional export terminal capacity due to extensive permit requirements and challenges from environmental organizations.. These may cause us to fail to recover all or a portion of our investments in those assets and may trigger the recognition of impairment charges, which could have a substantial adverse impact on our results of operations.  For example, due to the weak outlook for 8400 Btu coal, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $33.4 million related to goodwill at our 8400 Btu Cordero Rojo Mine during the year ended December 31, 2015.  This represented a full write down of the Cordero Rojo Mine's goodwill.  Additionally, in consideration of consensus projections of weak export pricing, a weak outlook for coal exports, and our associated decision at that time to amend the port and rail contracts to require no export shipments from 2016 through 2018, we determined that the carrying values of certain intangible assets in our Logistics and Related Activities segment were impaired.  Therefore, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we wrote off the full value of our port access rights of $52.2 million and our $6.0 million equity investment in GPT.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded impairments of $2.6 million, primarily for engineering costs related to the Overland Conveyor project at our Antelope Mine and $2.0 million related to a shovel that we do not expect to use because of declining productions.  Because of the volatile nature of U.S. and international coal demand and pricing, it is reasonably possible that our current. 29. Table of Contents. estimates of projected future cash flows from our mining assets may change in the near term, which may result in the need for further adjustments to the carrying value of mineral rights and other assets.. Acquisitions are a potentially important part of our long-term growth strategy and involve a number of risks, any of which could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits.. Acquisitions are a potentially important part of our long-term growth strategy, and we may pursue acquisition opportunities in the future in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.  If we fail to accurately estimate the future results and value of an acquired business or are unable to successfully integrate the businesses or properties we acquire, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, and we may be unable to grow our business.  Acquisition transactions involve various risks, including:.                   uncertainties in assessing the strengths and potential profitability, and the related weaknesses, risks, contingent and other liabilities, of acquisition candidates;.                   changes in business, industry, market or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying our rationale for pursuing the acquisition;.                   the inability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition;.                   the potential loss of key customers, management or employees of an acquired business;.                   the nature and composition of the workforce, including the acquisition of a unionized workforce;.                   diversion of our management's attention from other business concerns;.                   regulatory challenges for completing and operating the acquired business, including opposition from environmental groups or regulatory agencies;.                   environmental or geological problems in acquired coal properties, including factors that make the coal unsuitable for intended customers (due to ash, heat value, moisture, or contaminants), that make the coal more expensive to mine, or delay our ability to mine;.                   inability to acquire sufficient surface rights to enable extraction of coal resources;.                   outstanding permit violations associated with acquired assets;.                   difficulties or unexpected issues arising from our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting of the acquired business;.                   risks related to operating in new jurisdictions or industries, including increased exposure to foreign government and currency risks with respect to any international acquisitions; and.                   unanticipated liabilities associated with the acquired companies.. Any one or more of these factors could cause us not to realize the benefits we might anticipate from an acquisition.  Moreover, any acquisition opportunities we pursue could materially increase our liquidity and capital resource needs and may require us to incur indebtedness, seek equity capital or both.  We may not be able to satisfy these liquidity and capital resource needs on acceptable terms or at all.  In addition, future acquisitions could result in our assuming significant long-term liabilities relative to the value of the acquisitions.. We may be unable to obtain, maintain or renew permits or licenses necessary for our operations, including due to third party legal challenges or climate change-related assessments that are increasingly required as part of our regulatory processes, which would materially reduce our production, cash flows and profitability.. As a mining company, we must obtain a number of permits and licenses from various federal, state and local agencies and regulatory bodies that impose strict regulations on environmental and operational matters in connection with our. 30. Table of Contents. coal operations, including restricting the number of tons we may mine under our air quality permits.  We are also subject to strict regulatory requirements and oversight for our Sequatchie Valley reclamation property in Tennessee.  These rules, and the interpretations of these rules, are complex, change frequently and are often subject to discretionary interpretations by the regulators, all of which make compliance more difficult or impractical, and may possibly preclude the continuance of ongoing operations, impact the development of future mining operations, restrict the amount of our production, or subject us to significant fines and penalties.. The public, including non-governmental organizations, anti-mining groups and individuals, have certain statutory rights to comment upon and submit objections to requested permits and EISs prepared in connection with applicable regulatory processes.  These groups may also participate in the permitting and licensing process, including bringing citizens' lawsuits to challenge the issuance of permits, the validity of an EIS or performance of mining activities, which can create delay and uncertainty in acquiring permits and mining the coal underlying our leases.  Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion regarding certain challenges by environmental activist groups against regulatory permits and approvals for our mines.  These challenges seek to vacate prior regulatory decisions and authorizations that are legally required for some or all of our current or planned mining activities.  If we are required to reduce or modify our mining activities as a result of these challenges, the impact could have a material adverse effect on our shipments, financial results and liquidity, and could result in claims from third parties if we are unable to meet our commitments under pre-existing commercial agreements as a result of any such required reductions or modifications to our mining activities.. If our permits or licenses are not issued or renewed in a timely fashion or at all, or if permits issued or renewed are conditioned in a manner that restricts our ability to efficiently and economically conduct our mining activities, or if we are found to have violated any permitting or regulatory requirements, we could suffer a material reduction in our production, an impairment of our mineral rights, significant fines and penalties, and our cash flows or profitability could be materially adversely affected.. Existing and future legislation, treaties, regulatory requirements and public concerns relating to GHG emissions could negatively affect our customers and further reduce the demand for coal as a fuel source, causing coal prices and sales of our coal to materially decline.. Global climate change initiatives and public perceptions regarding fossil fuels have resulted, and are expected to continue to result, in decreased coal-fired power plant capacity and utilization, phasing out and closing many existing coal-fired power plants, reducing or eliminating construction of new coal-fired power plants in the United States and certain other countries, increased costs to mine coal and decreased demand and prices for thermal coal, including PRB coal. See Item 1 \"Business - Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters - Global Climate Change.\". There are three important sources of GHGs associated with the coal industry.  The end use of our coal in electricity generation is the largest of the three sources of GHGs.  Combustion of fuel for mining equipment used in coal production is another source of GHGs.  In addition, coal mining can release methane, a GHG, directly into the atmosphere.  These emissions from coal consumption and production are subject to pending and proposed regulations as part of regulatory initiatives to address global climate change and global warming.  Various international, federal, regional and state proposals are being considered to limit emissions of GHGs, including possible future U.S. treaty commitments, new federal or state legislation that may, among other things establish a cap-and-trade regime, and regulation under existing environmental laws by the EPA and other regulatory agencies.  For example, the United States recently joined nearly 200 other nations in an agreement to voluntarily limit GHG emissions.  Although the United States has since announced its intention to withdraw from the agreement, certain U.S. cities and states have announced their intention to satisfy their proportionate obligations under the agreement.  These and other voluntary pledges could further decrease demand and pricing for our coal.  Future regulation of GHG emissions may require additional controls on, or the closure of, coal-fired power plants and industrial boilers or may restrict the construction of new coal-fired power plants.  For example, the EPA released the CPP, which requires reductions in emissions from existing power plants, as well as new source performance standards for GHG emissions for new coal and oil-fired power plants, which require partial carbon capture and sequestration.  See \"Risks Related to Our Business and Industry -  Our long-term growth may be materially adversely impacted if economic, commercially available carbon capture technology for power plants is not developed and adopted in a timely manner.\"  These regulatory initiatives may increase our costs and decrease demand and pricing for our coal and logistics services, and may lead to increased demand for domestic electricity fired by natural gas because gas-fired plants are cheaper to construct, and permits to construct these plants can be easier to obtain.. The permitting of new coal-fired power plants has also recently been contested, at times successfully, by state regulators and environmental organizations due to concerns related to GHG emissions from the new plants.  Private litigation. 31. Table of Contents. has also been brought against industry participants based on GHG-related concerns.  The U.S. Supreme Court held that federal common law provides no basis for public nuisance claims against utilities due to their carbon dioxide emissions, but tort-type liabilities and other GHG-related claims against utilities and energy producers may be asserted.  For example, in 2011 residents and property owners along the Mississippi Gulf coast filed litigation against approximately 90 companies in energy, fossil fuels and chemical industries, including PRB and other domestic coal companies, alleging that the defendants caused the emission of GHGs that contributed to global warming, which in turn caused a rise in sea levels and added to the ferocity of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which combined to destroy the plaintiffs' property.  The lawsuit was dismissed by the Federal District Court in 2012 and the dismissal was affirmed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in May 2013.  However, if other GHG-related litigation, such as the California Climate Change Litigation, is successful, the coal industry and our company may be materially adversely impacted.  For a discussion of the California Climate Change Litigation, see Note 17 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.. Extensive environmental laws, including existing and potential future legislation, treaties and regulatory requirements relating to air emissions, affect our customers and could further reduce the demand for coal as a fuel source and cause coal prices and sales of our coal to materially decline.. The operations of our customers are subject to extensive environmental regulation particularly with respect to air emissions.  For example, CSAPR initially requires 28 states in the Midwest and eastern seaboard of the U.S. to significantly improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that cross state lines and contribute to ozone and/or fine particle pollution in other states.  In August 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated CSAPR and ordered the EPA to continue enforcing CAIR.  The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit's vacation of CSAPR, and the D.C. Circuit granted a request by the EPA to lift the stay of the rule.  Subsequently, in November 2014, the EPA issued an interim final rule reconciling the CSAPR rule with the Court's order to lift the stay, calling for Phase 1 implementation in 2015 and Phase 2 implementation in 2017.  In September 2016, the EPA finalized an update to the CSAPR ozone season program by issuing the Final CSAPR Update.  CSAPR is one of a number of significant regulations that the EPA has issued or expects to issue that will impose more stringent requirements relating to air, water and waste controls on electric generating units.  These rules include the EPA's requirements for CCR management, which were finalized in December 2014 and further regulate the handling of wastes from the combustion of coal.  In addition, in March 2013, the EPA formally adopted a revised final rule to reduce emissions of toxic air pollutants from power plants.  Specifically, MATS for power plants will reduce emissions from new and existing coal- and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units.  In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the MATS rule based on the EPA's failure to take costs into consideration and remanded the case back to the D.C. Circuit.  The D.C. Circuit remanded the rule to the EPA.  In April 2016, the EPA issued a final finding that it is appropriate and necessary to set standards for emissions of air toxics from coal- and oil-fired power plants.. Considerable uncertainty is associated with air emissions initiatives.  Under the previous administration, new regulations were in the process of being developed, and many existing and potential regulatory initiatives are subject to review by federal or state agencies or the courts or have been targeted for rescission by the current administration.  Stringent air emissions limitations are either in place or are likely to be imposed in the short to medium term, and these limitations will likely require significant emissions control expenditures for many coal-fired power plants.  As a result, these power plants may switch to other fuels that generate fewer of these emissions or may install more effective pollution control equipment that reduces the need for low-sulfur coal.  Any further switching of fuel sources away from coal, closure of existing coal-fired power plants, or reduced construction of new coal-fired power plants could have a material adverse effect on demand for, and prices received for, our coal.  Alternatively, less stringent air emissions limitations, particularly related to sulfur, to the extent enacted, could make low-sulfur coal less attractive, which could also have a material adverse effect on the demand for, and prices received for, our coal.  See Item 1 \"Business - Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters.\". Our mining operations are subject to extensive environmental, health, safety or other laws and regulations that could materially increase our costs or limit our ability to produce and sell coal.. Our mining operations, including our Sequatchie Valley reclamation property in Tennessee, are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental, health and safety, transportation, labor and other laws and regulations. See Item 1 \"Business - Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters.\"  Examples include those relating to:.                   employee health and safety;.                   emissions to air and discharges to water;. 32. Table of Contents.                   plant and wildlife protection, including endangered species protections;.                   the reclamation and restoration of properties after mining or other activity has been completed;.                   remediation of contaminated soil, surface and groundwater; and.                   the effects of operations on surface water and groundwater quality and availability.. Furthermore, we must compensate employees for work-related injuries through our workers' compensation insurance funds.  The erosion through tort liability of the protections we are currently provided by workers' compensation laws could increase our liability for work-related injuries.. MSHA is responsible for monitoring compliance with federal mine health and safety standards at our mines.  MSHA has various enforcement tools that it can use, including the issuance of citations resulting in monetary penalties and orders of withdrawal from a mine or part of a mine.  Since the April 2010 explosion at Massey Energy Company's (previously acquired by Alpha Natural Resources) Upper Big Branch Mine, increased scrutiny has been placed on the mining industry and has had significant impacts on the regulation of mine safety matters at the federal and state levels.  For example, federal authorities have announced additional targeted inspections of coal mines to evaluate several safety concerns, including the accumulation of coal dust and the proper ventilation of gases such as methane.  Federal authorities are also frequently proposing changes to mine safety rules and regulations, which could potentially result in additional or enhanced required safety equipment, more frequent mine inspections, stricter and more thorough enforcement practices and enhanced reporting requirements.  Any new environmental and/or health and safety requirements may be replicated in the states in which we operate and could increase our operating costs or otherwise prevent, delay or reduce our planned production, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. The costs, liabilities and requirements associated with complying with these requirements are often significant and time-consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production.  These factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  New legislation or administrative regulations or new judicial interpretations or administrative enforcement of existing laws and regulations may also require us to change operations significantly or incur increased costs.  For example, in November 2011, several environmental groups sued the EPA in Washington federal court to compel the EPA to include coal mines on the list of stationary sources governed by air pollution performance standards.  In that case, the Court denied the groups' rulemaking petition, and in July 2014, also denied a petition seeking a rehearing of the case en banc.  Any imposition of air emission standards on coal mines or any other such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. Because of the extensive regulatory environment in which we operate, we cannot assure complete compliance with all laws and regulations.  Failure to comply with these laws may result in significant costs to us to correct such violations, as well as civil or criminal penalties and limitations or shutdowns of our operations.  These laws and regulations may also significantly impair our ability to conduct our mining operations or result in increased operating costs.. Federal and state regulatory agencies have the authority to order any of our mines to be temporarily or permanently closed under certain circumstances, which could materially adversely affect our ability to meet our customers' demands.. Federal and state regulatory agencies have the authority following significant health and safety incidents, such as fatalities, to order a mine to be temporarily or permanently closed.  If this were to occur, we may be required to incur capital expenditures to re-open the mine.  In the event that these agencies order the closing of our mines, our coal sales agreements and our take-or-pay contracts related to our export terminals may permit us to issue force majeure notices, which suspend our obligations to deliver coal under these contracts.  However, our customers may challenge our issuances of force majeure notices.  If these challenges are successful, we may have to purchase coal from third-party sources, if it is available, to fulfill these obligations, incur capital expenditures to re-open the mines and/or negotiate settlements with the customers, which may include price reductions, the reduction of commitments or the extension of time for delivery or terminate customers' contracts.  Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. Our operations may affect the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, and our properties may have environmental contamination, any of which could result in material liabilities to us.. Our operations use hazardous materials and generate hazardous and non-hazardous wastes.  In addition, many of the locations that we own, lease or operate were used for coal mining and/or involved the generation, use, storage and disposal of. 33. Table of Contents. hazardous substances either before or after we were involved with these locations.  We may be subject to claims under federal and state statutes and/or common law doctrines for toxic torts, natural resource damages and other damages, as well as for the investigation and cleanup of soil, surface water, groundwater and other media.  These claims may arise, for example, out of current or former conditions at sites that we own, lease or operate currently, as well as at sites that we or predecessor entities owned, leased or operated in the past, and at contaminated third-party sites at which we have disposed of hazardous substances and waste.  As a matter of law, and despite any contractual indemnity or allocation arrangements or acquisition agreements to the contrary, our liability for these claims may be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of any contamination, or even for the entire share.. We may incur material costs and liabilities resulting from claims for damage to property or natural resources or injury to persons arising from our operations.  If we are pursued for sanctions, costs and liabilities in respect of these matters, our mining operations and, as a result, our profitability could be materially adversely affected.. Significant increases in taxes we pay on the coal we produce at our mine sites or deliver through our logistics business, such as royalties or severance and production taxes, including as a result of governmental audits, legislative, regulatory, or interpretive changes, could materially and adversely affect our profitability.. We pay federal, state and private royalties and federal, state and county severance and production taxes on the coal we sell.  A substantial portion of our royalties, severance, and production taxes are levied as a percentage of gross revenue with the remaining levied on a per ton basis.  For example, we pay production royalties of 12.5% of gross proceeds to the federal government on all coal sold at the mine sites.  We incurred royalties and severance and production taxes totaling $209.2 million, $208.7 million and $277.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The calculations used to determine royalty or severance and production tax payments can be complex and subject to interpretation, making it difficult in some cases to estimate such payments.  If royalties or severance and production tax rates were to significantly increase, or if the methodology by which the government agencies assess royalties or severance and production tax rates materially changes, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  Examples that could materially adversely affect our results include:.                   the federal government could again seek to significantly alter the method for valuing royalty payments;.                   a state government could increase severance or production taxes or any other tax applicable to our operations in that state; and.                   we could be required to make additional payments (including significant related interest and penalties) as a result of pending or future governmental audits, which can date back many years.. Failure to maintain our surety bonds on acceptable terms could affect our ability to secure reclamation and coal lease obligations and materially adversely affect our ability to mine or lease coal.. Federal and state laws require us to secure the performance of certain long-term obligations, such as mine closure costs, reclamation costs, and federal and state workers' compensation costs, including black lung.  The primary methods we use to meet those obligations are to provide a third-party surety bond or a letter of credit.  As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding surety bonds with third parties of $422.9 million.  Surety bond issuers and holders may demand additional collateral, unfavorable terms or higher fees.  Recently, there has been heightened regulatory pressure on reclamation bonding and self-bonding in particular.  Our failure to retain, or inability to acquire, surety bonds or letters of credit or to provide a suitable alternative could adversely affect our ability to mine or lease coal, which would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.  That failure could result from a variety of factors, including lack of availability, higher expense or unfavorable market terms, the exercise by third-party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the surety bonds and restrictions on availability of collateral for current and future third-party surety bond issuers under the terms of any credit arrangements then in place.  In addition, as a result of increased credit pressures on the coal industry, it is possible that surety bond providers could demand cash collateral as a condition to providing or maintaining surety bonds.  Any such demands, depending on the amount of any cash collateral required, could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial position.  If we are unable to meet cash collateral requirements and cannot otherwise obtain or retain required surety bonds, we may be unable to satisfy legal requirements necessary to conduct our mining operations.. Furthermore, while we have maintained a history of timely payments related to our LBAs, if we are unable to maintain our \"good payer\" status, we would be required to seek bonding for any remaining payments, which could adversely impact our cash flows and the amount of availability under our Credit Agreement, if such bonds could be obtained at all.. 34. Table of Contents. In addition, if federal or state laws are amended to require certain forms of financial assurance other than surety bonds, such as letters of credit, obtaining them, if we could obtain them at all, could have a material negative impact on our liquidity and results of operations.. Our business requires substantial capital expenditures, which we may be unable to provide.. Our business plan and strategy are dependent upon our acquisitions of additional reserves, which require substantial capital expenditures.  We also require capital for, among other purposes:.                   acquisition of surface rights;.                   equipment and the development of our mining operations;.                   capital renovations;.                   export terminal development projects;.                   maintenance and expansions of plants and equipment; and.                   compliance with environmental laws and regulations.. To the extent that cash on hand, cash generated internally and cash available under our Credit Agreement are not sufficient to fund capital requirements, we will require additional debt and/or equity financing.  However, additional debt or equity financing may not be available to us or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms.  Additionally, our debt instruments may restrict our ability to obtain such financing.  If we are unable to obtain additional capital, we may not be able to maintain or increase our existing production rates and we could be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures or change our business strategy, sell assets or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.. If the assumptions underlying our reclamation and mine closure obligations are materially inaccurate, our costs could be significantly greater than anticipated.. SMCRA and counterpart state laws and regulations establish operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining.  We accrue for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine closure.  Estimates of our total reclamation and mine-closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements and our experience.  The amounts recorded are dependent upon a number of variables, including the estimated future asset retirement costs, estimated proven reserves, assumptions involving profit margins of third-party contractors, inflation rates, discount rates and assumed credit-adjusted, risk-free rates.  Furthermore, these obligations are unfunded.  If our accruals are insufficient or our liability in a particular year is greater than currently anticipated, our future operating results could be materially adversely affected.. Increases in the cost of raw materials and other industrial supplies, or the inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of those supplies, could increase our operating expenses, disrupt or delay our production and materially adversely affect our profitability.. We use considerable quantities of explosives, petroleum-based fuels, tires, steel and other raw materials, as well as spare parts and other consumables in the mining process.  If the prices of steel, explosives, tires, petroleum products or other materials increase significantly or if the value of the U.S. dollar declines relative to foreign currencies with respect to certain imported supplies or other products, our operating expenses will increase, which could materially adversely impact our profitability.  Additionally, a limited number of suppliers exist for certain supplies, such as explosives and tires, as well as certain mining equipment, and any of our suppliers may divert their products to buyers in other mines or industries or divert their raw materials to produce other products that have a higher profit margin.  Shortages in raw materials used in the manufacturing of supplies and mining equipment, which, in some cases, do not have ready substitutes, or the cancellation of our supply contracts under which we obtain these raw materials and other consumables, could limit our ability to obtain these supplies or equipment.  As a result, we may not be able to acquire adequate replacements for these supplies or equipment on a cost-effective basis or at all, which could also materially increase our operating expenses or halt, disrupt or delay our production.. 35. Table of Contents. Furthermore, operating expenses at our mining locations are sensitive to changes in certain variable costs, including diesel fuel prices, which is one of our largest variable costs.  Our results depend on our ability to adequately control our costs, including diesel fuel.  Any increase in the price we pay for diesel fuel will have a negative impact on our results of operations.  See Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015  - Cost of Product Sold\" and Item 7A \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Commodity Price Risk.\". Our hedging activities for diesel fuel may prevent us from benefiting from cost price decreases.. Historically, we have entered into, and may in the future enter into, derivative financial instruments to help manage our exposure to market price changes to our diesel fuel costs, which were indexed to the West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") crude oil price as quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  As such, the nature of the derivative financial instruments did not directly offset market changes to our diesel fuel costs.. While any future hedge would provide us protection in the event of crude oil price increases, it would reduce our benefit when crude oil prices decrease below our floor and may require substantial payments by us to settle our financial instruments.  See Item 7A \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Commodity Price Risk\" and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.. Our hedging activities for coal sales prices may result in a negative impact from sales price changes.. As part of our logistics business, we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of international coal forward contracts to help manage our exposure to future coal sales prices by fixing a price now for a future  contracted coal delivery.  This type of hedge is designed to protect us from any price decreases.  While our hedging strategy provides us some degree of protection in the event future coal prices decrease it may also prevent us from benefiting if future coal prices increase above our hedged price and may require substantial payments by us to settle our financial instruments.. In addition, we have periodically used domestic coal futures contracts to help manage our exposure to market changes in domestic coal prices.  This type of hedge is designed to benefit us when prices change relative to our current open positions.  If there are significant and extended unfavorable price movements against our positions, our earnings and liquidity could be negatively impacted.  See Item 7A \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Commodity Price Risk\" and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are not accounted for as a hedge could cause volatility in our earnings.. From time to time, we enter into certain derivative financial instruments to help manage our exposure to future coal prices, both with respect to our export and domestic sales prices and to rises in our diesel costs.  Derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value.  To the extent these derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting or we choose not to designate them for hedge accounting, we are required to record changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments in our Consolidated Statement of Operations, resulting in increased volatility in our income in future periods.. Inaccuracies or future reductions in our estimates of our coal reserves could result in decreased profitability from lower than expected revenue or higher than expected costs.. We base our estimates of reserves on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our internal geologists and engineers, which are reviewed by an independent consultant every two years.  Our estimates of proven and probable coal reserves as to both quantity and quality are updated annually to reflect the production of coal from the reserves, updated geological models and mining recovery data, the tonnage contained in new lease areas acquired and estimated costs of production and sales prices.  There are numerous factors and assumptions inherent in estimating the quantities and qualities of, and costs to mine, coal reserves, any one of which may vary considerably from actual results.  These factors and assumptions include:.                   coal characteristics such as Btu and sulfur content;.                   geological and mining conditions, which may not be fully identified by available exploration data and/or may differ from our experiences in areas where we currently mine;. 36. Table of Contents.                   future coal prices and demand;.                   equipment and productivity;.                   operating costs, including for critical supplies such as fuel, tires and explosives;.                   capital expenditures and development and reclamation costs;.                   the percentage of coal ultimately recoverable;.                   the effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits, and taxes, including severance and production taxes and royalties, and other payments to governmental agencies; and.                   timing for the development of the reserves.. Any changes to the above factors and assumptions could cause our estimates of the quantities and qualities of economically recoverable coal to vary significantly.  Changes to the above factors and assumptions could also materially impact how we classify our reserves based on risk of recovery and our estimates of future net cash flows expected from these properties.  Actual production recovered from identified reserve areas and properties, and revenue and expenditures associated with our mining operations, may vary materially from estimates.  Any inaccuracy or further reductions in our proven and probable reserves estimates could result in decreased profitability from lower than expected revenue and/or higher than expected costs.. The majority of our coal sales agreements are forward sales contracts at fixed prices, which may not reflect favorable then-existing prices for coal or may affect our profitability if we cannot adequately control the costs of production for coal underlying such contracts.. We have historically sold most of our coal under long-term coal sales agreements, which we generally define as contracts with a term of one to five years.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 87% of our revenue was derived from supply contracts with terms of one year or greater.  The prices for coal sold under these agreements are typically fixed for an agreed amount of time.  Pricing in some of these contracts is subject to certain adjustments in later years or under certain circumstances, and may be below the current market price for similar type coal at any given time, depending on the time frame of the contract.. As a consequence of the substantial volume of our forward sales, our ability to capitalize on near term rises in coal prices is limited.  We have less coal available to sell under short-term contracts or on the spot market and we similarly have fewer tons to commit under long-term contracts at higher prices.  Our ability to realize higher prices is also restricted if customers elect to purchase additional volumes of coal, which is allowable under some contracts, at contract prices that are lower than spot prices.. Furthermore, to the extent our costs increase but pricing under our long-term coal sales agreements remains fixed, we may be unable to pass such increasing costs on to our customers.  If we are unable to control our costs, our results may be negatively impacted.. The loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we derived approximately 21% of our total revenue from sales to our three largest customers and approximately 50% of our total revenue from sales to our ten largest customers.  We may be unsuccessful in obtaining and renewing coal sales agreements with these customers, and some or all of these customers could discontinue purchasing coal from us.  If any of these customers, particularly any of our three largest customers, was to significantly reduce the quantities of coal it purchases from us, or if we are unable to sell coal to these customers on terms as favorable to us, the results of our business would be adversely impacted.. 37. Table of Contents. Changes in purchasing patterns in the coal industry may make it difficult for us to enter into new contracts with customers, or do so on favorable terms, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.. In recent years, we have experienced customers being less willing to enter into long-term coal sales agreements as they continue to adjust to relatively low U.S. natural gas prices, increased price volatility, increased fungibility of coal products, frequently changing regulations that have often disfavored coal usage and the increasing deregulation of their industry.  In addition, the prices for coal in the spot market may be lower than the prices previously set under many of our long-term coal sales agreements.  As our contracts with customers expire or are otherwise renegotiated, our customers may be less willing to extend or enter into new long-term coal sales agreements under their existing or similar pricing terms or our customers may decide to purchase fewer tons of coal than in the past.. To the extent our customers continue to shift away from long-term supply contracts, it will be more difficult to predict our future sales.  As a result, we may not have a market for our future production at acceptable prices.  The prices we receive in the spot market may be less than the contractual price an electric utility is willing to pay for a committed supply.  Furthermore, spot market prices tend to be more volatile than contractual prices, which could result in decreased revenue and profitability.  As of February 2018, we had approximately 45 million tons of committed sales for 2018 and 24 million tons for 2019, which is below our historical forward sales levels, leaving more coal left to be sold for those periods.. As a result of depressed thermal coal demand and competition from low priced natural gas, we received in the past, and may receive in the future, increased requests from customers to renegotiate, defer or cancel committed purchases under existing agreements.  If we are unable to resolve these customer requests on terms that preserve the amount and timing of our forecasted economic value, our anticipated cash flows, results and liquidity may be materially adversely impacted.. From time to time in the ordinary course of our business, customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of our coal sales agreements to reallocate certain committed volumes into future time periods, reduce or cancel committed volumes or make other adjustments to our coal sales agreements. We address these requests on a case-by-case basis and seek to reach mutually agreed resolutions of these requested modifications as part of managing our long-term customer relationships.  As a result of depressed thermal coal demand and competition from low priced natural gas, we have received in the past, and may  receive in the future, increased requests from customers to renegotiate, defer or cancel committed purchases under existing agreements, as occurred in early 2016. If we are unable to resolve these customer requests on terms that preserve the amount and timing of our forecasted economic value, our anticipated cash flows, results and liquidity may be materially adversely impacted.. Demand for U.S. thermal coal has declined significantly in recent years and is increasingly subject to fluctuations due to summer cooling demand, winter heating demand, economic growth rates and other factors that impact demand for electricity. This has resulted in a reduction in long-term sales, less visibility into future shipment volumes and increased fluctuations in shipments and associated financial results from period to period.. As a result of regulatory, political, and public pressures against using coal to generate electricity, increased competition with low-cost natural gas, increased competition with taxpayer subsidized solar and wind generation, improving energy efficiency, and other factors, demand for U.S. thermal coal has declined significantly in recent years, supporting a lower percentage of baseload electricity demand, and is increasingly subject to fluctuations due to summer cooling demand, winter heating demand, economic growth rates and other factors that impact demand for electricity.  This has resulted in a reduction in long-term sales of thermal coal, less visibility into future shipment volumes and increased fluctuations in shipments and associated financial results from period to period.  Although we are seeking to adjust our business and cost structure to reflect lower and more variable demand for thermal coal and to address the adverse impact of these changing conditions on our financial performance, our business requires substantial fixed costs and long lead-time investment decisions and we may not be successful in adjusting to these changing conditions.. We are exposed to counterparty risk with our customers, trading partners, financial institutions and other parties with whom we conduct business.. We face an increased risk that we do not receive payment for coal sold and delivered if the creditworthiness of any of our counterparties deteriorates or if any of our counterparties become subject to bankruptcy proceedings.  The creditworthiness of these counterparties depends on any number of factors, including the economic volatility and tightening of credit markets, and deregulation of the U.S. utilities markets, allowing utilities to sell their power plants to their non-regulated affiliates or third parties that may have credit ratings that are below investment grade.  Competition with other coal suppliers could cause us to extend credit to customers and on terms that could increase the risk of payment default.. 38. Table of Contents. From time to time, we have contracts to supply coal to energy trading and brokering companies, under which they purchase the coal for their own account or resell to domestic and foreign end users.  If the creditworthiness of these energy trading and brokering companies declines, this would increase the risk that we may not be able to collect payment for all coal sold and delivered to or on behalf of those companies.  Furthermore, if any of these companies seek to renegotiate or cancel sales of coal because of fluctuations in spot prices for coal, issues with their end users accepting the coal or other factors, we may be unable to sell previously anticipated volumes of coal at favorable prices or at all.  We also enter into derivative financial instruments with a number of financial institutions.  If one or more of these institutions were to default on its future obligation to us, our cash flows and results of operations would be negatively impacted.. In certain circumstances we may be entitled to demand credit enhancements or withhold shipments of coal from these parties if we determine they are not creditworthy.  However, these protections may be insufficient to cover our risks or could cause us to resell the coal on the spot market at unfavorable prices or not at all.. We maintain cash balances that we may invest from time to time in marketable securities issued by various counterparties including the U.S. government and U.S. government sponsored entities, municipal entities, financial institutions and other corporations.  If any of these counterparties fail, we could lose the principal invested with such counterparties, which would materially adversely impact our business, liquidity, and results of operations.. Certain provisions in our coal sales agreements may provide limited protection during adverse economic conditions or may result in economic penalties or suspension upon a failure to meet contractual requirements.. Price adjustment, \"price re-opener\" and other similar provisions in our supply contracts may reduce the protection from short-term coal price volatility traditionally provided by these contracts.  Most of our contracts with mine customers and some of our contracts with logistics customers contain provisions that allow for the base price of our coal to be adjusted due to new statutes, ordinances or regulations that affect our costs related to performance.  Because these provisions only apply to the base price of coal, these terms may provide only limited protection due to changes in regulations.  Some of our contracts with mine customers also contain provisions that allow the purchase prices to be renegotiated at periodic intervals.  A price re-opener provision is one in which either party can renegotiate the price of the contract, sometimes at pre-determined times. Index provisions allow for the adjustment of the price based on a fixed formula.  These provisions may reduce the protection available under our contracts from short-term coal price volatility.  Our international contracts may contain a fixed price for the first year of the contract with future years' prices to be negotiated at a specific point in time.  If the parties fail to satisfactorily negotiate a price, the contract could be terminated.  Any adjustment or renegotiations leading to a significantly lower contract price, or a termination of the contract, could result in decreased revenue.. Our coal sales agreements with our mine customers typically contain force majeure provisions allowing temporary suspension of performance by us or our customers during the duration of specified events beyond the control of the affected party.  For example, as a result of the very mild 2015/16 winter and low natural gas prices, a greater than normal number of our customers in 2016 sought to reduce the amount of tons delivered to them under our coal sales agreements through contractual remedies, such as contract buyout provisions.  Our contracts with our mine customers also typically allow our customers to suspend performance in the event that the railroad fails to provide its services due to circumstances that would constitute a force majeure.  In addition, our contracts with our international logistics customers generally contain a clause that requires us to pay the demurrage fee charged by the vessel for delays in shipping the coal on behalf of our foreign customers.. Most of our coal sales agreements also contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal within certain ranges for specific coal characteristics, such as heat content, sulfur, ash and ash fusion temperature.  Failure to meet these specifications can result in economic penalties, including price adjustments, suspension, rejection or cancellation of deliveries or termination of the contracts.  A number of our contracts also contain clauses, which, in some cases, may allow customers to terminate the contract in the event of certain changes in environmental laws and regulations.. Our ability to operate our business effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.. Our ability to operate our business and implement our strategies depends, in part, on the continued contributions of our executive officers and other key employees.  The loss of any of our key senior executives could have a material adverse effect on our business unless and until we find a qualified replacement.  A limited number of persons exist with the requisite experience and skills to serve in our senior management positions.  We may not be able to locate or employ qualified executives on acceptable terms and our failure to retain or attract qualified executives could have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business.. 39. Table of Contents. Efficient coal mining using modern techniques and equipment also requires skilled laborers in multiple disciplines such as electricians, equipment operators, mechanics, engineers and welders, among others.  We have from time to time encountered shortages for these types of skilled labor and typically compete for such positions with other industries, including oil and gas.  If we experience shortages of skilled labor in the future, our labor and overall productivity or costs could be materially adversely affected.  In the future, we may utilize a greater number of external contractors for portions of our operations.  The costs of these contractors have historically been higher than that of our employed laborers.  If our labor and contractor prices increase, or if we experience materially increased health and benefit costs with respect to our employees, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.. Our work force could become unionized in the future, which could negatively impact the stability of our production and materially reduce our profitability.. All of our mines are operated by non-union employees.  Our employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to form or affiliate with a union, and in the past, unions have conducted limited organizing activities in this regard.  If our employees choose to form or affiliate with a union and the terms of a union collective bargaining agreement are significantly different from our current compensation and job assignment arrangements with our employees, these arrangements could negatively impact the stability of our production and materially reduce our profitability.  In addition, even if our managed operations remain non-union, our business may still be adversely affected by work stoppages at unionized companies or unionized transportation and service providers.. Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity in response to these attacks or acts of war may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.. Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity or acts of war may have significant effects on general economic conditions, fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending, market liquidity, and disruptions to the domestic or international coal supply chains, each of which could negatively impact our business.  Furthermore, any such acts, which directly affect our customers and their business may have negative consequences to our own operations.  Strategic targets such as energy-related assets and transportation assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other targets in the U.S. or in other countries.  Disruption or significant increases in energy prices could result in government-imposed price controls.  It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including from delays or losses in transportation, decreased sales of our coal or extended collections from customers that are unable to timely pay us in accordance with the terms of their supply agreement.. We face the risk of systems failures as well as cybersecurity risks, including \"hacking.\". The computer systems and network infrastructure we and others use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems.  These problems may arise in both our internally developed systems and the systems of our third-party service providers.  Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect computer equipment against damage from fire, power loss or telecommunication failure.  Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could adversely affect our business.  In addition, our computer systems and network infrastructure present security risks, and could be susceptible to hacking.. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Liquidity. Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations.. As of December 31, 2017, we had consolidated indebtedness of $351.7 million.  We also have lease and royalty obligations related to our federal coal leases.  Our outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences such as:.                   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund growth, such as mergers and acquisitions; working capital; capital expenditures; debt service requirements; future LBAs; potential cash settlement of equity compensation awards, or other cash requirements;.                   requiring much of our cash flow to be dedicated to interest obligations and making it unavailable for other purposes;.                   with respect to any indebtedness under the Credit Agreement or other variable rate debt, exposing us to the risk of increased interest costs if the underlying interest rates rise on our variable rate debt;. 40. Table of Contents.                   limiting our ability to invest operating cash flow in our business (including to obtain new LBAs or make capital expenditures) due to debt service requirements;.                   causing us to need to sell assets and properties at an inopportune time;.                   limiting our ability to compete effectively with companies that are not as leveraged and that may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns, including competitors who have become less leveraged when they emerged from bankruptcy;.                   limiting our ability to acquire new coal reserves and/or LBAs and plant and equipment needed to conduct operations;.                   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and general economic and market conditions; and.                   a downgrade in the credit rating of our indebtedness, which could increase the cost of further borrowings and negatively impact our available liquidity.. We may incur substantially more debt in the future.  If our indebtedness is further increased, the related risks that we now face, including those described above, could increase.  In addition to the principal repayments on outstanding debt, we have other demands on our cash resources, including significant maintenance and other capital expenditures, including LBAs, and operating expenses.  Our ability to pay our debt depends upon our operating performance.  In particular, economic conditions could cause revenue to decline, and hamper our ability to repay indebtedness.  If we do not have enough cash to satisfy our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt, sell assets, limit certain capital expenditures, including future LBAs, or reduce spending or we may be required to issue equity.  We may not be able to, at any given time, refinance our debt or sell assets and we may not be able to, at any given time, issue equity, in either case on acceptable terms or at all.. If we are unable to comply with the covenants or restrictions contained in our debt instruments, the lenders could declare all amounts outstanding under those instruments to be due and payable and foreclose on their collateral, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operations.. Our debt instruments include covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to dispose of assets, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other restricted payments, create liens on assets, make investments, loans or advances, make acquisitions, engage in mergers or consolidations and engage in certain transactions with affiliates.  The debt instruments also require compliance with various financial covenants.  These restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs or otherwise restrict corporate activities.. A failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants could have serious consequences to our financial condition or result in a default under those debt instruments and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions.  A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these debt instruments and to foreclose upon collateral securing the debt.  Furthermore, an event of default or an acceleration under one of our debt instruments could also cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration of another debt instrument or contractual obligation, which would adversely impact our liquidity. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations.  We may not be granted waivers or amendments to these debt instruments if for any reason we are unable to comply with these debt instruments, and we may not be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.. Covenants under our Credit Agreement may limit the amount of funds available to us.. Our ability to borrow is subject to the terms and conditions of our Credit Agreement.  The financial covenants are based on a monthly minimum liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain liquidity of not less than $125 million as of the last day of each month.  We had $507.9 million of liquidity under this measure as of December 31, 2017.  Our aggregate available borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement and the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility (\"A/R Securitization Program\") was approximately $400.0 million as of December 31, 2017.  See Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Agreement\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - A/R Securitization Program.\". 41. Table of Contents. Provisions in our debt instruments could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a \"change of control\" as defined in the indentures, holders of the senior notes have the right to require us to repurchase all outstanding notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase.  Furthermore, a \"change in control\" as defined in our Credit Agreement is considered an event of default.  These provisions could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us.. Our Credit Agreement provides an important source of our overall liquidity.  We will need to extend or replace the Credit Agreement before its maturity in February 2019.  If we are unable to successfully extend or replace the Credit Agreement in a timely manner, our future financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.. Our Credit Agreement matures in February 2019.  Our ability to timely extend or replace our Credit Agreement in a sufficient amount, for a sufficient term and on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, may be adversely impacted by numerous other factors, including, our overall financial condition, results and financial projections, the amount and timing of our other obligations and liquidity needs, coal industry conditions in the U.S. and globally, investor sentiment toward the coal industry, the availability of credit and impact of anti-fossil fuel loan and investment restrictions imposed by traditional sources of credit and capital, general debt and capital markets conditions, U.S. and global economic conditions and other factors and circumstances existing at that time.. If we are unable to successfully extend or replace our Credit Agreement in a timely manner in a sufficient amount, for a sufficient term and on commercially reasonable terms, due to any of these or other factors, our future financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.. Other Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure and Common Stock. Our previous separation from Rio Tinto could subject us and our stockholders to any number of risks and uncertainties.  For example, Rio Tinto has provided notice that it is seeking indemnification under our master separation. agreement of any indemnifiable liabilities arising from the climate change litigation in California against Rio Tinto and numerous other fossil fuel industry defendants.. We entered into various agreements with Rio Tinto and its affiliates in connection with the 2009 IPO and separation from Rio Tinto.  CPE Resources agreed to indemnify Rio Tinto for certain liabilities pursuant to these agreements.  As discussed in this Form 10-K in Note 17, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" of our Consolidated Financial Statements, certain Rio Tinto entities are named defendants in litigation filed in July 2017 by multiple California local governments in California state court, naming numerous fossil fuel companies as defendants (together, the \"California Climate Change Litigation\").  The California Climate Change Litigation alleges, among other things, that defendants knowingly contributed to GHG emissions that have adversely impacted the environment, thereby creating financial liabilities for the plaintiffs and that defendants engaged in a coordinated effort to conceal and deny their own knowledge of those climate change threats, discredit scientific evidence and create doubt in the minds of customers, consumers, regulators, the media, journalists, teachers and the public about the consequences of the impacts of their alleged fossil fuel pollution.  Although Cloud Peak Energy is not named as a defendant, in August 2017, Rio Tinto provided Cloud Peak Energy with a notice seeking indemnification pursuant to our 2009 master separation agreement with Rio Tinto, which requires us to indemnify Rio Tinto for certain liabilities relating to our business conducted prior to and after the closing of our 2009 separation from Rio Tinto and may potentially include liabilities in connection with the California Climate Change Litigation.  Because the master separation agreement and other separation-related agreements were entered into while we were part of Rio Tinto, some of the terms of these agreements are likely less favorable to us than similar agreements negotiated between unaffiliated third parties.  Third parties may also seek to hold us responsible for liabilities of Rio Tinto that we did not assume in connection with the 2009 IPO and for which Rio Tinto agreed to indemnify us, including liabilities related to the Jacobs Ranch and Colowyo mines, as well as the uranium mining venture that we do not own.  If any of these liabilities are significant and we are ultimately held liable for them, we may not be able to recover the full amount of our losses from Rio Tinto.  Refer to the applicable exhibits listed in Item 15 of this Form 10-K for the complete terms and conditions of the principal outstanding agreements with Rio Tinto entered into in connection with our 2009 IPO.. CPE Inc. is a holding company with no direct operations of its own and depends on distributions from CPE Resources to meet its ongoing obligations.. CPE Inc. is a holding company with no direct operations of its own and has no independent ability to generate revenue.  Consequently, its ability to obtain operating funds depends upon distributions from CPE Resources and payments. 42. Table of Contents. under the management services agreement.  Pursuant to its management services agreement, CPE Resources makes payments to CPE Inc. in the form of a management fee and cost reimbursements to fund CPE Inc.'s day-to-day operating expenses, such as payroll for its officers.  However, if CPE Resources cannot make the payments pursuant to the management services agreement, CPE Inc. may be unable to cover these expenses.. The distribution of cash flows by CPE Resources to CPE Inc. is subject to statutory restrictions under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act and contractual restrictions under CPE Resources's debt instruments that may limit the ability of CPE Resources to make distributions.  In addition, any distributions and payments of fees or costs are subject to CPE Resources's financial condition.. As the sole member of CPE Resources, CPE Inc. incurs income taxes on any net taxable income of CPE Resources.  The debt instruments allow CPE Resources to distribute cash in amounts sufficient for CPE Inc. to pay its tax liabilities payable to any governmental entity.  To the extent CPE Inc. needs funds for any other purpose, and CPE Resources is unable to provide such funds for any reason, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.. The price of our common stock has declined significantly in the past and could decline further for a variety of reasons, resulting in a substantial loss on investment and negatively impacting our ability to raise equity capital.. Our stock price decreased from $9.26 per share on January 2, 2015 to $2.08 per share on December 31, 2015.  While it has increased to $4.21 per share on February 7, 2018, it could decline again.  Such decline could result from a variety of factors, including, among other things, actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or financial condition, new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations impacting our business, our customers' businesses, or the coal transportation and logistics industry, sales of CPE Inc.'s common stock by our stockholders or by us, a downgrade or cessation in coverage from one or more of our analysts, broad market fluctuations and general economic conditions and any other factors described in this \"Risk Factors\" section of this Form 10-K.. The current trading price of our common stock, or any further decline thereof, might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of CPE Inc.'s common stock or other equity securities and may cause a loss of  part or all of an investment in shares of our common stock.  In addition, if we sell additional shares of CPE Inc. common stock, that would result in dilution to existing stockholders and may result in decreases to our stock price and the value of existing investments in our stock.  Those decreases may be more significant if we sell additional shares at depressed trading prices.. The closing market price of our common stock has declined significantly in the past.  If the average closing price of our common stock declines to less than $1.00 over 30 consecutive trading days, our common stock could be delisted from the NYSE or trading could be suspended.. Our common stock is currently listed on the NYSE. In order for our common stock to continue to be listed on the NYSE, we are required to comply with various listing standards, including the maintenance of a minimum average closing price of at least $1.00 per share during a consecutive 30 trading-day period. A renewed or continued decline in the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE could result in a breach of these requirements. Although we would have an opportunity to take action to cure such a breach, if we did not succeed, the NYSE could commence suspension or delisting procedures in respect of our common stock. The commencement of suspension or delisting procedures by an exchange remains, at all times, at the discretion of such exchange and would be publicly announced by the exchange. If a suspension or delisting were to occur, there would be significantly less liquidity in the suspended or delisted securities. In addition, our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing, and attract and retain personnel by means of equity compensation, would be greatly impaired. Furthermore, with respect to any suspended or delisted securities, we would expect decreases in institutional and other investor demand, analyst coverage, market making activity and information available concerning trading prices and volume, and fewer broker-dealers would be willing to execute trades with respect to such securities. A suspension or delisting would likely decrease the attractiveness of our common stock to investors and cause the trading volume of our common stock to decline, which could result in a further decline in the market price of our common stock.. We may issue shares of preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock.. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our stockholders. Any preferred stock that is. 43. Table of Contents. issued may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends, liquidation rights, or voting rights. If we issue preferred stock, it may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.. We do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock.. We do not expect to pay any dividends on our common stock, in cash or otherwise, in the foreseeable future.  We intend to retain any earnings for use in our business. In addition, the indentures governing our senior notes restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. In the future, we may agree to further restrictions on our ability to pay dividends..
