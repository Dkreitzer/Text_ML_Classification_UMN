[1] "ITEM 1A.                                       RISK FACTORS. You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities.  Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies such as general economic conditions, geopolitical events, competition, technological obsolescence, and employee relations.  The risks described below, along with risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial, may impair our business operations and our liquidity in an adverse way.. 20. Table of Contents. Our advertising revenue can vary substantially from period to period based on many factors beyond our control.  This volatility affects our operating results and may reduce our ability to repay indebtedness or reduce the market value of our securities.. We rely on sales of advertising time for the majority of our revenues and, as a result, our operating results depend on the amount of advertising revenue we generate.  If we generate less advertising revenue, it may be more difficult for us to repay our indebtedness and the value of our business may decline.  Our ability to sell advertising time depends on:. • the levels of automobile advertising, which historically have represented about one quarter of our advertising revenue; for the year ended December 31, 2017, automobile advertising represented 25.4%, respectively, of our net time sales and internet revenue;. • the health of the economy in the areas where our television stations are located and in the nation as a whole;. • the popularity of our programming and that of our competition;. • the levels of political advertising, which are affected by campaign finance laws and the ability of political candidates and political action committees to raise and spend funds, which are subject to seasonal fluctuations;. • the effects of declining live/appointment viewership as reported through rating systems and local television efforts to adopt and receive credit for same day viewing plus viewing on-demand thereafter;. • the effects of new rating methodologies;. • changes in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located;. • the activities of our competitors, including increased competition from other forms of advertising-based mediums, such as other broadcast television stations, radio stations, MVPDs, internet and broadband content providers and other print, outdoor, and media outlets serving in the same markets;. • over-the-top (OTT) and other emerging technologies and their potential impact on cord-cutting;. • the impact of MVPDs, vMVPDs, and OTT distributors offering \"skinny\" programming bundles that may not include television broadcast stations;. • changes in pricing and sellout levels; and. • other factors that may be beyond our control.. There can be no assurance that our advertising revenue will not be volatile in the future or that such volatility will not have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.. Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations.. We have a high level of debt, totaling $4,048.7 million at December 31, 2017, compared to the book value of shareholders' equity of $1,534.4 million on the same date.  We expect to incur additional indebtedness as part of our acquisition of Tribune Media Company (Tribune) as discussed in Commitment Letters and Incremental Term B Facility related to Tribune Acquisition under Note 6. Notes Payable and Commercial Bank Financing within the Consolidated Financial Statements.. Our relatively high level of debt poses the following risks, particularly in periods of declining revenues:. • we may be unable to service our debt obligations, including payments on notes as they come due, especially during general negative economic, financial credit, and market industry conditions;. • we may use a significant portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt, especially during general negative economic and market industry conditions;. • the amount available for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and other general corporate purposes may be limited because a significant portion of cash flow is used to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt;. • our lenders may not be as willing to lend additional amounts to us for future working capital needs, additional acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;. • the cost to borrow from lenders may increase;. • our ability to access the capital markets may be limited, and we may be unable to issue securities with pricing or other terms that we find attractive, if at all;. • if our cash flow were inadequate to make interest and principal payments, we might have to restructure or refinance our indebtedness or sell one or more of our stations to reduce debt service obligations;. • we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than less leveraged competitors and thus, less able to withstand competitive pressures; and. 21. Table of Contents. • because the interest rate under the Bank Credit Agreement is a floating rate, any increase will reduce the funds available to repay our obligations and for operations and future business opportunities and will make us more vulnerable to the consequences of our leveraged capital structure.  As of December 31, 2017, approximately $1,587.0 million principal amount of our recourse debt relates to the Bank Credit Agreement.. Any of these events could reduce our ability to generate cash available for investment, debt repayment, or capital improvements or to respond to events that would enhance profitability.. Commitments we have made to our lenders limit our ability to take actions that could increase the value of our securities and business or may require us to take actions that decrease the value of our securities and business.. Our existing financing agreements prevent us from taking certain actions and require us to meet certain tests.  These restrictions and tests may require us to conduct our business in ways that make it more difficult to repay unsecured debt or decrease the value of our securities and business.  These restrictions and tests include the following:. • restrictions on additional debt;. • restrictions on our ability to pledge our assets as security for indebtedness;. • restrictions on payment of dividends, the repurchase of stock and other payments relating to our capital stock;. • restrictions on some sales of certain assets and the use of proceeds from asset sales;. • restrictions on mergers and other acquisitions, satisfaction of conditions for acquisitions and a limit on the total amount of acquisitions without the consent of bank lenders;. • restrictions on permitted investments;. • restrictions on the lines of business we and our subsidiaries may operate; and. • financial ratio and condition tests including, the ratio of first lien indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA and the ratio of Sinclair Television Group, Inc. (STG) total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA.. Future financing arrangements may contain additional restrictions and tests.  All of these restrictive covenants may limit our ability to pursue our business strategies, prevent us from taking action that could increase the value of our securities or may require actions that decrease the value of our securities.  In addition, we may fail to meet the tests and thereby default on one or more of our obligations (particularly if the economy weakens and thereby reduces our advertising revenues).  If we default on our obligations, creditors could require immediate payment of the obligations or foreclose on collateral. If this happens, we could be forced to sell assets or take other actions that could significantly reduce the value of our securities and business and we may not have sufficient assets or funds to pay our debt obligations.. A failure to comply with covenants under our debt instruments could result in a default under such debt instruments, acceleration of amounts due under our debt and loss of assets securing our loans.. Certain of our debt agreements contain cross-default provisions with our other debt, which means that a default under certain of our debt instruments may cause a default under certain indentures or the Bank Credit Agreement.. If we breach certain of our debt covenants, our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately, and, if the debt is secured, could immediately take possession of the property securing such debt.  In addition, if any other lender declared its loan due and payable as a result of a default, the holders of our outstanding notes, along with the lenders under the Bank Credit Agreement, might be able to require us to pay those debts immediately.. As a result, any default under our debt covenants could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to meet our obligations.. Any insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding relating to material third-party licensees as defined by our Bank Credit Agreement, would cause a default and potential acceleration under the Bank Credit Agreement.. Our Bank Credit Agreement contains certain cross-default provisions with certain material third-party licensees, defined as any party that owns the license assets of one or more television stations which we provide services to pursuant to LMAs and/or other outsourcing agreements and those stations provide 20% or more of our aggregate broadcast cash flows.  A default caused by an involuntary or voluntary petition filed for liquidation, reorganization or other relief of insolvency by a material third-party licensee, or a failure of a material third-party licensee to preserve and maintain its legal existence or any of its material rights, privileges or franchises including its broadcast licenses, would cause an event of default and potential acceleration under our Bank Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2017, there were no material third party licensees as defined in our Bank Credit Agreement.. 22. Table of Contents. Despite current debt levels, we may be able to incur significantly more debt in the future, which could increase the foregoing risks related to our indebtedness.. At December 31, 2017, we had $484.5 million available (subject to certain borrowing conditions) for additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility) of the Bank Credit Agreement.  Under the terms of the debt instruments to which we are subject, and provided we meet certain financial and other covenants, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including additional senior debt and secured debt.  If we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described in the risk factors in this report relating to having substantial debt could intensify.. We expect to incur additional indebtedness as part of our acquisition of Tribune as discussed in Commitment Letters and Incremental Term B Facility related to Tribune Acquisition under Note 6. Notes Payable and Commercial Bank Financing within the Consolidated Financial Statements.. Our strategic acquisitions and investments could pose various risks and increase our leverage.. We have pursued and intend to selectively continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and investments, subject to market conditions, our liquidity, and the availability of attractive acquisition and investment candidates, with the goal of improving our business.  We may not be able to identify other attractive acquisitions or investment targets or we may not be able to fund additional acquisitions or investments in the future.. Acquisitions involve inherent risks, such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could strain our human resources.  Additionally, we may not be able to successfully implement effective cost controls, achieve expected synergies, or increase revenues as a result of an acquisition.  In addition, future acquisitions may result in our assumption of unexpected liabilities and may result in the diversion of management's attention from the operation of our core business.. Certain acquisitions, such as television stations, are subject to the approval of the FCC and potentially, other regulatory authorities.  The need for FCC and other regulatory approvals could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and potentially require us to divest certain television stations if the FCC believes that a proposed acquisition would result in excessive concentration in a market, even if the proposed combinations may otherwise comply with FCC ownership limitations.    There can be no assurance that pending acquisitions will be approved by the FCC or other regulatory authorities, or that a requirement to divest existing stations or business will not have an adverse outcome on the transaction.. See Note 2. Acquisitions and Dispositions of Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of acquisitions completed in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, and our pending acquisition of Tribune.. Our investments in other non-media related businesses involve risks, including the diversion of resources, that may adversely affect our business or results of operations.. We have made investments in certain non-media related businesses.  See Item 1. Business for further description of such investments and/or subsidiaries.  Managing the operations of these businesses and the costs incurred by these businesses involve risks, including the diversion of our management's attention from managing the operations of our broadcast businesses and diverting other resources that could be used in our broadcast businesses. Such diversion of resources may adversely affect our business and results of operations.  In addition, our investments in real estate ventures carry inherent risks related to owning interests in real property, including, among others, the relative illiquidity of real estate, potential adverse changes in real estate market conditions, and changes in tenant preferences.  There can be no assurance that our investments in these businesses will yield a positive rate of return or otherwise be recoverable.. 23. Table of Contents. Financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our industry, business, and results of operations or financial condition.. Financial and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the fundamentals of our business, results of operations, and/or financial condition.  Poor economic and industry conditions could have a negative impact on our industry or the industry of those customers who advertise on our stations, including, among others, the automotive industry and service businesses, each of which is a significant source of our advertising revenue.  Additionally, financial institutions, capital providers, or other consumers may be adversely affected.  Potential consequences of any financial and economic decline include:. • the financial condition of those companies that advertise on our stations and digital platforms, including, among others, the automobile manufacturers and dealers, may be adversely affected and could result in a significant decline in our advertising revenue;. • our ability to pursue the acquisition of attractive television and non-television assets may be limited if we are unable to obtain any necessary additional capital on favorable terms, if at all;. • our ability to pursue the divestiture of certain television and non-television assets at attractive values may be limited;. • the possibility that our business partners, such as counterparties to our outsourcing and news share arrangements, could be negatively impacted and our ability to maintain these business relationships could also be impaired;. • our ability to refinance our existing debt on terms and at interest rates we find attractive, if at all, may be impaired;. • our ability to make certain capital expenditures may be significantly impaired; and. • the possibility of consumers cutting the cord, thereby impacting our retransmission revenues.. We purchase television programming in advance based on expectations about future revenues.  Actual revenues may be lower than our expectations.  If this happens, we could experience losses that may make our securities less valuable.. One of our most significant costs is network and syndicated programming.  Our ability to generate revenue to cover this cost may affect the value of our securities.  If a particular network or program is not popular in relation to its costs, we may not be able to sell enough advertising time to cover the cost.. We generally purchase syndicated programming content from others rather than producing such content ourselves, therefore, we have limited control over the costs of the programming.  Often we must purchase syndicated programming several years in advance and may have to commit to purchase more than one year's worth of programming.  We may replace programs that are doing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred or before we have fully amortized the costs.  We also receive programming from networks with which we have network affiliation agreements.  Generally, the agreements are for many years.  The popularity of networks can affect revenue earned on those channels.  Any of these factors could reduce our revenues or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues.  These factors are exacerbated during a weak advertising market.. We internally originate television programming in advance based on expectations about future revenues.  Actual revenues could fluctuate and may be lower than our expectations.  If this happens, we could experience losses that may make our securities less valuable.. The production of internally originated programming requires a large up-front investment and the revenues derived from the airing of internally originated programming primarily depends upon its acceptance by the public, which is difficult to predict.  The commercial success of original content also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing content released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of a growing number of alternative forms of entertainment, general economic conditions and their effects on consumer spending, and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues.  These factors are exacerbated during a weak advertising market.. We may lose a large amount of programming if a network terminates its affiliation or program service arrangement with us, we are not able to negotiate arrangements at terms comparable to or more favorable than our current agreements, or if networks make programming available through services other than our local affiliates, which could increase our costs and/or reduce our revenue.. The networks produce and distribute programming in exchange for each station's commitment to air the programming at specified times and for commercial announcement time during programming.  The amount and quality of programming provided by each network varies.  See Television Markets and Stations within Item 1. Business for a detailed listing of our stations and channels.. 24. Table of Contents. As network affiliation agreements come up for renewal, we (or licensees of the stations we provide programming and/or sales services to), may not be able to negotiate terms comparable to or more favorable than our current agreements.  The non-renewal or termination of any of our network affiliation agreements would prevent us from being able to carry programming of the relevant network.  This loss of programming would require us to obtain replacement programming, which may involve higher costs and which may not be as attractive to our target audiences, resulting in reduced revenues. Upon the termination of any of our network affiliation agreements, we would be required to establish a new network affiliation agreement for the affected station with another network or operate as an independent station.  At such time, the remaining value of the network affiliation asset could become impaired and we would be required to record impairment charges to write down the value of the asset to its estimated fair value.. We cannot predict the outcome of any future negotiations relating to our affiliation agreements or what impact, if any, they may have on our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, the impact of an increase in reverse network compensation payments, under which we compensate the network for programming pursuant to our affiliation agreements, may have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  See Television Markets and Stations within Item 1. Business for a listing of expirations of our affiliations agreements.. We may not be able to renegotiate retransmission consent agreements at terms comparable to or more favorable than our current agreements and networks with which we are affiliated are currently, or in the future are expected to, require us to share revenue from retransmission consent agreements with them.. As retransmission consent agreements expire, we may not be able to renegotiate such agreements at terms comparable to or more favorable than our current agreements.  This may cause revenues and/or revenue growth from our retransmission consent agreements to decrease under the renegotiated terms despite the fact that our current retransmission consent agreements include automatic annual fee escalators.  In addition, certain networks or program service providers with which we are affiliated are currently, or in the future are expected to, require us to share revenue from retransmission consent agreements with them as part of renewing expiring affiliation agreements or pursuant to certain rights contained in existing affiliation agreements.  Generally, our retransmission consent agreements and agreements with networks or program service providers are for different lengths of time and expire in different periods.  If we are unable to negotiate a retransmission consent agreement or the revenue received as part of those agreements declines over time, then we may be exposed to a reduction in or loss from retransmission revenue net of revenue shared with networks and program service providers.  We cannot predict the outcome or provide assurances as to the outcome of any future negotiations relating to our affiliation agreements or what impact, if any, they may have on our financial condition and results of operations.  See Television Markets and Stations within Item 1. Business for a listing of expirations of our affiliations agreements.. During 2016, we entered into a consent decree with the FCC pursuant to an investigation regarding allegations made by an MVPD that we violated FCC rules around negotiating retransmission consent agreements.  See Changes in the Rules on Television Ownership under Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.. The effects of the economic environment could require us to record an asset impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.. We are required to analyze goodwill and certain other intangible assets for impairment.  The accounting guidance establishes a method of testing goodwill and broadcast licenses for impairment on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if an event occurs that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived asset below its carrying value.  For additional information regarding impairments to our goodwill and broadcast licenses, see Valuation of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates within Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5.  Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Intangible Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements.. 25. Table of Contents. Key officers and directors have financial interests that are different and sometimes opposite from ours and we may engage in transactions with these officers and directors that may benefit them to the detriment of other security holders.. Some of our officers, directors, and majority shareholders own stock or partnership interests in businesses that do business with us or otherwise do business that conflicts with our interests.  They may transact some business with us upon approval by the independent members of our board of directors even if there is a conflict of interest or they may engage in business competitive to our business and those transactions may benefit the officers, directors or majority shareholders to the detriment of our security holders.  Each of David D. Smith, Frederick G. Smith, and J. Duncan Smith is an officer and director of Sinclair and Robert E. Smith is a director of Sinclair.  Together, the Smiths hold shares of our common stock that control the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of shareholders.. David D. Smith, Frederick G. Smith, J. Duncan Smith, Robert E. Smith, and David B. Amy, our Vice Chairman, together own interests (less than 5% in aggregate) in Allegiance Capital Limited Partnership, a limited partnership in which we also hold an interest.  Frederick G. Smith owns an interest (less than 1%) in Patriot Capital II, L.P., a limited partnership in which we also hold an interest.  David Smith owned an interest (less than 3%) in Towson Row LLC, a real estate venture, in which we also held an interest, until its sale in May 2017.  For additional information regarding our related person transactions, see Note 11. Related Person Transactions within the Consolidated Financial Statements.  We can give no assurance that these transactions or any transactions that we may enter into in the future with our officers, directors, or majority shareholders, have been, or will be, negotiated on terms as favorable to us as we would obtain from unrelated parties.  Maryland law and our financing agreements limit the extent to which our officers, directors, and majority shareholders may transact business with us and pursue business opportunities that we might pursue.  These limitations do not, however, prohibit all such transactions.. We depend on key personnel and we may not be able to operate and grow our business effectively if we lose the services of our senior executive officers or are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future.. We depend on the efforts of our management and other key employees.  The success of our business depends heavily on our ability to develop and retain management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future.  Competition for senior management personnel is intense, and we may not be able to retain our key personnel.  If we are unable to do so, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely affected.. The Smiths exercise control over most matters submitted to a shareholder vote and may have interests that differ from other security holders.  They may, therefore, take actions that are not in the interests of other security holders.. As of December 31, 2017, David D. Smith, Frederick G. Smith, J. Duncan Smith, and Robert E. Smith hold shares representing approximately 74.9% of the common stock voting rights of the Company and, therefore, control the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of shareholders, including, but not limited to, electing directors, adopting amendments to our certificate of incorporation, and approving corporate transactions.  The Smiths hold substantially all of the Class B Common Stock, which have ten votes per share.  Our Class A Common Stock has only one vote per share.  In addition, the Smiths hold half our board of directors' seats and, therefore, have the power to exert significant influence over our corporate management and policies.  The Smiths have entered into a stockholders' agreement pursuant to which they have agreed to vote for each other as candidates for election to our board of directors until December 31, 2025.. Although in the past the Smiths have recused themselves from related person transactions, circumstances may occur in which the interests of the Smiths, as the controlling security holders, could be in conflict with the interests of other security holders and the Smiths would have the ability to cause us to take actions in their interest.  In addition, the Smiths could pursue acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to our other security holders.  Further, the concentration of ownership the Smiths have may have the effect of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a future change of control, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and might reduce the price of our shares.. (See Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters and Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, which will be included as part of our Proxy Statement for our 2018 Annual Meeting.). 26. Table of Contents. Significant divestitures by the Smiths could cause them to own or control less than 51% of the voting power of our shares, which would in turn give Cunningham the right to terminate the LMAs and other outsourcing agreements with Cunningham due to a \"change in control.\"  Any such terminations would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  The FCC's multiple ownership rules may limit our ability to operate multiple television stations in some markets and may result in a reduction in our revenue or prevent us from reducing costs.  Changes in these rules may threaten our existing strategic approach to certain television markets.  See the risk factor below regarding the FCC's multiple ownership rules.. We may be subject to investigations or fines from governmental authorities, such as, but not limited to penalties related to violations of FCC indecency rules and other FCC rules and policies, the enforcement of which has increased in recent years, and complaints related to such violations may delay our renewal applications with the FCC.. We provide a significant amount of live news reporting that is provided by the broadcast networks or is controlled by our on-air news talent.  Although both broadcast network and our on-air talent have generally been professional and careful in what they say, there is always the possibility that information may be reported that is inaccurate or even in violation of certain indecency rules promulgated by the FCC.  In addition, entertainment and sports programming provided by broadcast syndicators and networks may contain content that is in violation of the indecency rules promulgated by the FCC.  Because the interpretation by the courts and the FCC of the indecency rules is not always clear, it is sometimes difficult for us to determine in advance what may be indecent programming.  We have insurance to cover some of the liabilities that may occur, but the FCC has enhanced its enforcement efforts relating to the regulation of indecency.  Violation of the indecency rules could potentially subject us to penalties, license revocation, or renewal or qualification proceedings.  There can be no assurance that an incident that may lead to significant fines or other penalties by the FCC can be avoided.. From time to time, we may have received or been promised payment for airing program material.  FCC rules require that all such sponsored material be explicitly identified at the time of the broadcast as paid for and by whom, except when it is clear that the mention of a product or service constitutes sponsorship identification.  There can be no assurance that an incident that may lead to significant fines or other penalties by the FCC can be avoided.  On December 21, 2017, the FCC issued a Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture proposing a $13.4 million fine for violations of the FCC's sponsorship identification rules by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. We have responded to dispute the Commission's findings and the proposed fine; however, we cannot predict the outcome of any potential FCC action related to this matter.. From time to time, we may be the subject of an investigation from governmental authorities.  There can be no assurance that an incident that may lead to significant fines or other penalties can be avoided.. Federal regulation of the broadcasting industry limits our operating flexibility, which may affect our ability to generate revenue or reduce our costs.. The FCC regulates our business, just as it does all other companies in the broadcasting industry.  We must obtain the FCC's approval whenever we need a new license, seek to renew, assign or modify a license, purchase a new station, sell an existing station, or transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that hold a license.  Our FCC licenses and those of the licensees which we provide services to pursuant to LMAs and other outsourcing agreements are critical to our operations; we cannot operate without them.  We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions in a timely manner, if at all.  If licenses are not renewed or acquisitions are not approved, we may lose revenue that we otherwise could have earned.. In addition, Congress and the FCC may, in the future, adopt new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters (including, but not limited to, technological changes in spectrum assigned to particular services) that could, directly or indirectly, materially and adversely affect the operation and ownership of our broadcast properties.  (See Item 1. Business.). The FCC's multiple ownership rules may limit our ability to operate multiple television stations in some markets and may result in a reduction in our revenue or prevent us from reducing costs.  Changes in these rules may threaten our existing strategic approach to certain television markets.. Television ownership. As discussed in National Ownership Rule under Federal Regulation of Television Broadcasting within Item 1. Business, in April 2017 the FCC adopted the UHF Discount Order on Reconsideration to restore the UHF discount, which reinstatement became effective in June 2017.  The UHF Discount Order on Reconsideration is the subject of a pending Petition for Review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  On December 18, 2017, the Commission released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to examine the National Ownership Rule, including the UHF. 27. Table of Contents. discount.  We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. Because we are near the 39% cap without application of the UHF discount, changes to the UHF discount or National Ownership Rule could limit our ability to acquire television stations in additional markets.. Under federal law, the FCC is required to review its ownership rules every four years (a \"Quadrennial Review\") to determine whether they are necessary in the public interest as the result of competition and to repeal or modify any regulation the FCC determines to be no longer in the public interest.. In August 2016, the FCC completed both its 2010 and 2014 quadrennial reviews of its media ownership rules and issued an order (Ownership Order) which left most of the existing multiple ownership rules intact, but amended the rules to provide for the attribution of JSAs where two television stations are located in the same market, and a party with an attributable interest in one station sells more than 15% of the advertising time per week of the other station. The Ownership Order also required that JSAs that existed prior to March 31, 2014, may remain in place until October 1, 2025, at which point they must be terminated, amended or otherwise come into compliance with the rules.  These \"grandfathered\" JSAs could be transferred or assigned without losing grandfathering status.  The subsequent Ownership Order on Reconsideration eliminated the JSA attribution rule.  The rule changes adopted in the Ownership Order on Reconsideration became effective on February 7, 2018.  A Petition for Review of the Ownership Order on Reconsideration, including the elimination of the JSA attribution rule, was filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and Sinclair filed to intervene in the proceeding.  On February 7, 2018, the Court denied, among other things, Petitioners' request to stay the effective date of the Ownership Order on Reconsideration and instead issued a stay of the appeal for a period of 6 months.  We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.  If we are required to terminate or modify our JSAs, our business could be adversely affected in several ways, including losses on investments and termination penalties.  The revenues of these JSA arrangements we earned during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $63.2 million and $58.6 million, respectively.. Certain of our stations have entered into what have commonly been referred to as local marketing agreements or LMAs.  One typical type of LMA is a programming agreement between two separately owned television stations serving the same market, whereby the licensee of one station programs substantial portions of the broadcast day and sells advertising time during such programming segments on the other licensee's station subject to the ultimate editorial and other controls being exercised by the latter licensee. We believe these arrangements allow us to reduce our operating expenses and enhance profitability.  During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we generated net revenue from our LMAs of $86.8 million and $88.7 million, respectively.. In addition to our LMAs, we have entered into outsourcing agreements (such as JSAs) whereby 31 stations provide various non-programming related services such as sales, operational and managerial services to or by other stations within the same markets.  We believe this structure allows stations to achieve operational efficiencies and economies of scale, which should otherwise improve broadcast cash flow and competitive positions.  For additional information, refer to Television Markets and Stations within Item 1. Business.. See Changes in the Rules on Television Ownership under Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.. If we are required to terminate or modify our LMAs and other outsourcing agreements, our business could be affected in the following ways:. • Loss of revenues.  If the FCC requires us to modify or terminate existing arrangements, we would lose some or all of the revenues generated from those arrangements.  We would lose revenue because we will have fewer demographic options, a smaller audience distribution and lower revenue share to offer to advertisers.. • Increased costs.  If the FCC requires us to modify or terminate existing arrangements, our cost structure would increase as we would potentially lose significant operating synergies and we may also need to add new employees.  With termination of LMAs, we likely would incur increased programming costs because we will be competing with the separately owned station for syndicated programming.. • Losses on investments.  As part of certain of our arrangements, we own the non-license assets used by the stations with which we have arrangements.  If certain of these arrangements are no longer permitted, we would be forced to sell these assets, restructure our agreements or find another use for them.  If this happens, the market for such assets may not be as good as when we purchased them and, therefore, we cannot be certain of a favorable return on our original investments.. • Termination penalties.  If the FCC requires us to modify or terminate existing arrangements before the terms of the arrangements expire, or under certain circumstances, we elect not to extend the terms of the arrangements,. 28. Table of Contents. we may be forced to pay termination penalties under the terms of certain of our arrangements.  Any such termination penalties could be material.. • Alternative arrangements.  If the FCC requires us to terminate the existing arrangements, we may enter into one or more alternative arrangements.  Any such arrangements may be on terms that are less beneficial to us than the existing arrangements.. Failure of owner / licensee to exercise control. The FCC requires the owner / licensee of a station to maintain independent control over the programming and operations of the station.  As a result, the owners / licensees of those stations with which we have LMAs can exert their control in ways that may be counter to our interests, including the right to preempt or terminate programming in certain instances.  The preemption and termination rights cause some uncertainty as to whether we will be able to air all of the programming that we have purchased under our LMAs and therefore, uncertainty about the advertising revenue that we will receive from such programming.  In addition, if the FCC determines that the owner / licensee is not exercising sufficient control, it may penalize the owner licensee by a fine, revocation of the license for the station or a denial of the renewal of that license.  Any one of these scenarios, especially the revocation of or denial of renewal of a license, might result in a reduction of our cash flow or margins and an increase in our operating costs.  In addition, penalties might also affect our qualifications to hold FCC licenses, putting our own licenses at risk.. The pendency and indeterminacy of the outcome of these ownership rules, which may limit our ability to provide services to additional or existing stations pursuant to licenses, LMAs, outsourcing agreements or otherwise, expose us to a certain amount of volatility, particularly if the outcomes are adverse to us.  Further, resolution of these ownership rules has been and will likely continue to be a cost burden and a distraction to our management and the continued absence of a resolution may have a negative effect on our business.. The FCC's National Broadband Plan may result in a loss of spectrum for our stations potentially adversely impacting our ability to compete.. Congress authorized the FCC to conduct so-called \"incentive auctions\" to auction and re-purpose broadcast television spectrum for mobile broadband use.  See Broadcast Incentive Auction under Note 2. Acquisitions and Dispositions of Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our participation, results, and post-auction process.. We can not predict whether the FCC will adopt further policies or incentive auctions which may affect our broadcast spectrum.. Competition from other broadcasters or other content providers and changes in technology may cause a reduction in our advertising revenues and/or an increase in our operating costs.. New technology and the subdivision of markets. Cable providers, direct broadcast satellite companies, and telecommunication companies are developing new technology that allows them to transmit more channels on their existing equipment to highly targeted audiences, reducing the cost of creating channels and potentially leading to the division of the television industry into ever more specialized niche markets. Competitors who target programming to such sharply defined markets may gain an advantage over us for television advertising revenues. The decreased cost of creating channels may also encourage new competitors to enter our markets and compete with us for advertising revenue. In addition, technologies that allow viewers to digitally record, store, and play back television programming may decrease viewership of commercials as recorded by media measurement services such as Nielsen or comScore and, as a result, lower our advertising revenues. The current ratings provided by Nielsen for use by broadcast stations for live viewing Digital Video Recording playback are limited to 7 days past the original air date.  Additionally, in most market, no credit is giving for online viewing.. The effects of new ratings system technologies, including ''code readers'', ''viewer assignment'', ''portal people meters'' and ''set-top boxes,'' and the ability of such technologies to be a reliable standard that can be used by advertisers is still under review for accreditation from The Media Rating Council, an independent organization that monitors rating services in 154 markets, measures ratings exclusively by its diary methodology. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 50 of our 89 markets are diary only markets.. Since digital television technology allows broadcasting of multiple channels within the additional allocated spectrum, this technology could expose us to additional competition from programming alternatives. In addition, technological advancements and the resulting increase in programming alternatives, such as cable television, direct broadcast satellite systems, pay-per-view, home video and entertainment systems, video-on-demand, OTT, mobile video, and. 29. Table of Contents. the Internet have also created new types of competition to television broadcast stations and will increase competition for household audiences and advertisers. We cannot provide any assurances that we will remain competitive with these developing technologies.. Types of competitors. We also face competition from rivals that may have greater resources than we have.  These include:. • other local free over-the-air broadcast television and radio stations;. • telecommunication companies;. • cable and satellite system operators and cable networks;. • print media providers such as newspapers, direct mail and periodicals;. • internet search engines, internet service providers, websites, and mobile applications; and. • other emerging technologies including mobile television, over-the-top technologies, and MVPD \"skinny\" packages.. Deregulation. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 and subsequent actions by the FCC and the courts have removed some limits on station ownership, allowing telephone, cable, and some other companies to provide video services in competition with us.  In addition, the FCC has reallocated and auctioned off a portion of the spectrum for new services including fixed and mobile wireless services and digital broadcast services.  As a result of these changes, new companies are able to enter our markets and compete with us.. We have invested and will continue to invest in new technology initiatives which may not result in usable technology.. We have heavily invested in the development of the NextGen platforms as discussed in Development of Next Generation Broadcast Platform under Operating Strategy within Item 1. Business.  We do not know whether the outcome of our research and development will result in technology that will be usable on our distribution platform or available to license to third parties.  Additionally, even if our efforts result in usable technology, we do not know whether it will be included within the ATSC 3.0 framework.  Any failure to develop this technology could result in the loss of our investment.  Our cost incurred related to the development of the NextGen platform is recorded within research and development within our consolidated statement of operations.. We could be adversely affected by labor disputes and legislation and other union activity.. The cost of producing and distributing entertainment programming has increased substantially in recent years due to, among other things, the increasing demands of creative talent and industry-wide collective bargaining agreements.  Although we generally purchase programming content from others rather than produce such content ourselves, our program suppliers engage the services of writers, directors, actors and on-air and other talent, trade employees, and others, some of whom are subject to these collective bargaining agreements.  Approximately 800 of our employees are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements.  If we or our program suppliers are unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages.  Failure to renew these agreements, higher costs in connection with these agreements or a significant labor dispute could adversely affect our business by causing, among other things, delays in production that lead to declining viewers, a significant disruption of operations, and reductions in the profit margins of our programming and the amounts we can charge advertisers for time.  Our stations also broadcast certain professional sporting events, including NBA basketball games, MLB baseball games, NFL football games, and other sporting events, and our viewership may be adversely affected by player strikes or lockouts, which could adversely affect our advertising revenues and results of operations.  Further, any changes in the existing labor laws, including the possible enactment of the Employee Free Choice Act, may further the realization of the foregoing risks.. 30. Table of Contents. Unrelated third parties may bring claims against us based on the nature and content of information posted on websites maintained by us.. We host internet services that enable individuals to exchange information, generate content, comment on our content, and engage in various online activities.  The law relating to the liability of providers of these online services for activities of their users is currently unsettled both within the United States and internationally.  Claims may be brought against us for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, unlawful activity, tort, including personal injury, fraud, or other theories based on the nature and content of information that may be posted online or generated by our users.  Our defense of such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources.. Costs of complying with changes in governmental laws and regulations may adversely affect our results of operations.. We cannot predict what other governmental laws or regulations will be enacted in the future, how future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or how future laws or regulations will affect us.  Compliance with new laws or regulations, including proposed legislation to address climate change, or stricter interpretation of existing laws, may require us to incur significant expenditures or impose significant restrictions on us and could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations.. Changes in accounting standards can affect reported earnings and results of operations.. Generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying pronouncements and implementation guidelines for many aspects of our business, including those related to revenues, leases, consolidation, programming, intangible assets, pensions, income taxes, share-based compensation, and broadcast rights, are complex and involve significant judgments. Changes in rules or their interpretation could significantly change our reported earnings, results of operations, and compliance with debt covenants.. If we fail to maintain the requirements for continued listing on the NASDAQ stock market, our common stock could be delisted from trading, which would adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital.. Our common stock is currently listed for quotation on the NASDAQ stock market. We are required to meet specified listing criteria in order to maintain our listing.  If we fail to satisfy continued listing requirements, our common stock could be delisted.  Any potential delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ would make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell our stock in the public market and would likely result in decreased liquidity and increased volatility for our common stock.. Terrorism or armed conflict domestically or abroad may negatively impact our advertising revenues and results of operations.  Future conflicts, terrorist attacks or other acts of violence may have a similar effect.. If the United States becomes engaged in global conflicts in the future, there may be an adverse effect on our results of operations.  Also, any terrorist attacks or other acts of violence may have a similar negative effect on our business or results of operations.. Cybersecurity risks, cyber incidents, data privacy, and other information technology failures could adversely affect our business and disrupt operations..
