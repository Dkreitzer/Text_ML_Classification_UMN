[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. RISK FACTORS. The material risks that management believes affect the Company are described below.  Before making an investment decision with respect to any of the Company's securities, you should carefully consider the risks as described below, together with all of the information included herein.  The risks described below are not the only risks the Company faces.  Additional risks not presently. 21. Table of Contents. known also may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.  The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ substantially from those discussed or implied in these forward-looking statements.. Risks Relating to the Company's Business. A return of recessionary conditions could result in increases in the Company's level of nonperforming loans and/or reduced demand for the Company's products and services, which could lead to lower revenue, higher loan and lease losses and lower earnings.. A return of recessionary conditions and/or negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which the Company does business, the value of its loans and investments and its ongoing operations, costs and profitability.  Despite a general improvement in the overall economy and the real estate market, the economic environment remains challenging, particularly in the Company's market area.  Declines in real estate values and sales volumes and increased unemployment or underemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies, increases in the Company's levels of nonperforming and classified assets and a decline in demand for its products and services.  These negative events may cause the Company to incur losses and may adversely affect its capital, liquidity and financial condition.. The size of the Company's loan portfolio has grown in recent years, but, if the Company is unable to sustain loan growth, its profitability may be adversely affected.. Since December 31, 2011, the Company's gross loans held for investment have increased from $1.37 billion to $1.62 billion at December 31, 2017.  The Talmer acquisition in 2016 resulted in $221.0 million of additional loans, primarily classified as commercial and commercial real estate. During some years in this period, the Company was managing its balance sheet composition to manage its capital levels and position the Bank to meet and exceed its targeted capital levels.  The Company's ability to increase profitability will depend on a variety of factors, including its ability to originate attractive new lending relationships.  While the Company believes it has the management resources and lending staff in place to continue the successful implementation of its strategic plan, if the Company is unable to increase the size of its loan portfolio, its strategic plan may not be successful and its profitability may be adversely affected.. Nonperforming assets take significant time to resolve, adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition and could result in further losses in the future.. The Company's nonperforming loans (which consist of nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more, still accruing interest and restructured loans still accruing interest) and its nonperforming assets (which include nonperforming loans plus OREO) are reflected in the table below at December 31 (in millions):. 2017 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t     \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t2016 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t     \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t% Change \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tNonperforming loans \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t$ \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 15.6 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t$ \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 16.0 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t (2.5) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tOREO \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 8.4 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 11.9 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t (29.4) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tTotal nonperforming assets \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t$ \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 24.0 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t$ \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 27.9 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t (14.0). The Company's nonperforming assets adversely affect its net income in various ways.  For example, the Company does not accrue interest income on nonaccrual loans and OREO may have expenses in excess of any lease revenues collected, thereby adversely affecting the Company's net income, return on assets and return on equity.  The Company's loan administration costs also increase because of its nonperforming assets.  The resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant time commitments from management, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities.  There is no assurance that the Company will not experience increases in nonperforming assets in the future, or that its nonperforming assets will not result in  losses in the future.. The Company's loan portfolio is concentrated heavily in commercial and residential real estate loans, including exposure to construction loans, which involve risks specific to real estate values and the real estate markets in general, all of which have experienced significant weakness.. The Company's loan portfolio generally reflects the profile of the communities in which the Company operates.  Because the Company operates in areas that saw rapid historical growth, real estate lending of all types is a significant portion of its loan portfolio.  Total real estate lending, excluding deferred fees, was $1.26 billion, or approximately 78.0%, of the Company's loan portfolio at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.18 billion, or approximately 79.7%, at December 31, 2016.  Given that the primary (if not only) source of collateral on these loans is real estate, additional adverse developments affecting real estate values in the Company's market area could increase the credit risk associated with the Company's real estate loan portfolio.. In addition, with respect to commercial real estate loans, the banking regulators are examining commercial real estate lending activity with greater scrutiny, and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement improved underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for losses and. 22. Table of Contents. capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposures.  At December 31, 2017, the Company's outstanding commercial real estate loans, including owner occupied real estate, were equal to 298.7% of its total risk-based capital.  If the Company's regulators require us to maintain higher levels of capital than we would otherwise be expected to maintain, this could limit the Company's ability to leverage its capital and have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.. Real estate market volatility and future changes in disposition strategies could result in net proceeds that differ significantly from fair value appraisals of loan collateral and OREO and could negatively impact the Company's operating performance.. Many of the Company's nonperforming real estate loans are collateral-dependent, meaning the repayment of the loan is largely dependent upon the cash flows from the operation of the property securing the loan, or the sale of the property.  For collateral-dependent loans, the Company estimates the value of the loan based on appraised value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.  The Company's OREO portfolio essentially consists of properties acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure in partial or total satisfaction of certain loans as a result of borrower defaults.  Some property in OREO reflects property formerly utilized as a bank premise or land that was acquired with the expectation that a bank premise would be established at the location. In some cases, the market for such properties has been significantly depressed, and we have been unable to sell them at prices or within timeframes that we deem acceptable. OREO is recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loans for which property served as collateral or estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs.  In determining the value of OREO properties and loan collateral, an orderly disposition of the property is generally assumed.  Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of property, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility.. If the Company fails to effectively manage credit risk, its business and financial condition will suffer.. The Company must effectively manage credit risk.  As a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms, and that the collateral securing repayment of their loans, if any, may not be sufficient to ensure repayment.  In addition, there are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks relating to proper loan underwriting, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, including the risk that a borrower may not provide information to the Company about its business in a timely manner, and/or may present inaccurate or incomplete information to the Company, and risks relating to the value of collateral.  In order to manage credit risk successfully, the Company must, among other things, maintain disciplined and prudent underwriting standards and ensure that its lenders follow those standards.  The weakening of these standards for any reason, such as an attempt to attract higher yielding loans, a lack of discipline or diligence by the Company's employees in underwriting and monitoring loans, the inability of the Company's employees to adequately adapt policies and procedures to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting borrowers and the quality of the Company's loan portfolio, may result in loan defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs and may necessitate that we significantly increase the Company's ALLL, each of which could adversely affect the Company's net income.  As a result, the Company's inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.. The Company's Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses may be insufficient to absorb potential losses in the Company's loan portfolio.. The Company's success depends significantly on the quality of our assets, particularly loans. Like other financial institutions, the Company is exposed to the risk that our borrowers may not repay their loans according to their terms, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to fully compensate the Company for the outstanding balance of the loan plus the costs to dispose of the collateral. As a result, the Company may experience significant loan and lease losses that may have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results and financial condition.. The Company maintains an ALLL at a level the Company believes adequate to absorb estimated losses inherent in its existing loan portfolio.  The level of the allowance reflects management's continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; credit loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic, political, and regulatory conditions; and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio.. While the Company had loan loss reserve releases in 2014 and 2015, its provision for loan and lease losses was increased in 2016 and 2017, which is commensurate with the loan and lease portfolio growth experienced in those years. The Bank may be required to make significant increases in the provision for loan and lease losses and to charge-off additional loans in the future.. Determination of the allowance is inherently subjective since it requires significant estimates and management judgment of credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes.  For example, the final allowance for December 31, 2017, December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, included an amount reserved for other not specifically identified risk factors.  New information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, and other factors, both within and outside of the Company's control, may require an increase in the ALLL. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Company's allowance and may require an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based. 23. Table of Contents. on judgments different from those of management.  If charge-offs in future periods exceed the ALLL, the Company will need additional provisions to increase the allowance.  Any increases in the allowance will result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.. Finally, the measure of the Company's ALLL is dependent on the adoption and interpretation of accounting standards.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, recently issued a new credit impairment model, the Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL model, which will become applicable to the Company in 2020.  Under the CECL model, the Company will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \"incurred loss\" model currently required under GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred.  Accordingly, the Company expects that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how we determine our ALLL and could require the Company to significantly increase its allowance.  Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of the Company's ALLL.  If the Company is required to materially increase its level of ALLL for any reason, such increase could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.. The Company's business is concentrated in and dependent upon the welfare of several counties in Illinois specifically and the State of Illinois generally.. The Company's primary market area is Aurora, Illinois, and its surrounding communities as well as Cook County.  The city of Aurora is located in northeastern Illinois, approximately 40 miles west of Chicago.  The Bank operates primarily in Kane, Kendall, DeKalb, DuPage, LaSalle, Will and Cook counties in Illinois, and, as a result, the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to changes and fluctuations in the economic conditions in those areas.. The communities that the Company serves grew rapidly during the early 21st century, and despite the relative severity of the economic downturn that hit the Company's key markets, the Company intends to continue concentrating its business efforts in these communities.  The Company's future success is largely dependent upon the overall economic health of these communities and the ability of the communities to continue to rebound from the difficulties that began in 2007.  While the economies in our market have stabilized, difficult economic conditions remain, and the State of Illinois continues to experience severe fiscal challenges.  Payment lapses by the State of Illinois to its vendors and government sponsored entities may have negative effects on our primary market area.  To the extent that these issues, or any future state tax increases, impact the economic vitality of the businesses operating in Illinois, encourage businesses to leave the state or discourage new employers to start or move businesses to Illinois, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.. If the overall economic conditions do not continue to improve, particularly within the Company's primary market areas, the Company could experience a lack of demand for its products and services, an increase in loan delinquencies and defaults and high or increased levels of problem assets and foreclosures with little prospect of state governmental issue resolution or assistance, even contractual assistance.  Moreover, because of the Company's geographic concentration, it is less able than other regional or national financial institutions to diversify its credit risks across multiple markets.. Credit downgrades, partial charge-offs and specific reserves could develop in selected exposures with resulting impact on the Company's financial condition if the State of Illinois encounters more severe financial difficulties.  Management continues to closely monitor the impact of developments on our markets and customers.. The Company operates in a highly competitive industry and market area and may face severe competitive disadvantages.. The Company faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and have more financial resources.  The Company's competitors primarily include national and regional banks as well as community banks within the markets the Company serves.  Recently, local competitors have expanded their presence in the western suburbs of Chicago, including the communities that surround Aurora, Illinois, and these competitors may be better positioned than the Company to compete for loans, acquisitions and personnel.  The Company also faces competition from savings and loan associations, credit unions, personal loan and finance companies, retail and discount stockbrokers, investment advisors, mutual funds, insurance companies, and other financial intermediaries.  As customers' preferences and expectations continue to evolve, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the Internet and for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems.  Because of this rapidly changing technology, the Company's future success will depend in part on its ability to address its customers' needs by using technology.  Customer loyalty can be easily influenced by a competitor's new products, especially offerings that could provide cost savings or a higher return to the customer. Moreover, the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative and regulatory changes, and many large scale competitors can leverage economies of scale to offer better pricing for products and services compared to what the Company can offer.. 24. Table of Contents. The Company's ability to compete successfully depends on developing and maintaining long-term customer relationships, offering community banking services with features and pricing in line with customer interests and expectations, consistently achieving outstanding levels of customer service and adapting to many and frequent changes in banking as well as local or regional economies.  Failure to excel in these areas could significantly weaken the Company's competitive position, which could adversely affect the Company's growth and profitability.  These weaknesses could have a significant negative impact on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.. The Company faces a risk of noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations and corresponding enforcement proceedings.. The federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the \"PATRIOT Act,\" and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and to file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Federal and state bank regulators also have begun to focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If the Company's policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that the Company has already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, the Company would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on its ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of the Company's business plan, including its acquisition plans, which would negatively impact the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for the Company.. The Company's strategic growth plans contemplate additional organic growth and potential growth through additional acquisitions, which exposes us to additional risks.. The Company's strategic growth plans contemplate additional organic growth and potential growth through additional acquisitions. To the extent that the Company is unable to increase loans through organic loan growth, or to identify and consummate attractive acquisitions, the Company may be unable to successfully implement its growth strategy, which could materially and adversely affect the Company's financial condition and earnings.. The Company routinely evaluates opportunities to acquire additional financial institutions or branches or to open new branches. As a result, the Company regularly engages in discussions or negotiations that, if they were to result in a transaction, could have a material effect on the Company's operating results and financial condition, including short- and long-term liquidity. The Company's acquisition activities could require it to use a substantial amount of common stock, cash, other liquid assets, and/or incur debt. Moreover, these types of expansions involve various risks, including:. Management of Growth.    The Company may be unable to successfully:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmaintain loan quality in the context of significant loan growth;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tidentify and expand into suitable markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtain regulatory and other approvals necessary to consummate acquisitions or other expansion activities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tretain customers of businesses that it acquires;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tattract sufficient deposits and capital to fund anticipated loan growth;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmaintain adequate common equity and regulatory capital;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tavoid diversion or disruption of its management and existing operations as well as those of the acquired institution;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmaintain adequate management personnel and systems to oversee such growth;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmaintain adequate internal audit, loan review and compliance functions; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timplement additional policies, procedures and operating systems required to support such growth.. 25. Table of Contents. Operating Results.    There is no assurance that existing branches or future branches will maintain or achieve deposit levels, loan balances or other operating results necessary to avoid losses or produce profits. The Company's growth may entail growth in overhead expenses as it adds new branches and staff. There are considerable costs involved in opening branches, and new branches generally do not generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs until they have been in operation for at least a year or more. Accordingly, any new branches the Company establishes can be expected to negatively impact the Company's earnings for some period of time until they reach certain economies of scale. The Company's historical results may not be indicative of future results or results that may be achieved, particularly if the Company continues to expand.. Failure to successfully address these and other issues related to the Company's expansion could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations, and could adversely affect the Company's ability to successfully implement its business strategy.. The Bank is a community bank and its ability to maintain its reputation is critical to the success of its business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect its performance.. The Bank is a community bank, and its reputation is one of the most valuable components of its business.  As such, the Company strives to conduct its business in a manner that enhances its reputation.  This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share the Company's core values: being an integral part of the communities the Company serves; delivering superior service to the Company's customers; and caring about the Company's customers and associates.  If the Company's reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of its employees or otherwise, its business and operating results may be adversely affected.. The Company is subject to interest rate risk, and a change in interest rates could have a negative effect on its net income.. The Company's earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon the Company's net interest income.  Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company's control, including general economic conditions, the Company's competition and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve.  Changes in monetary policy could influence Company earnings.  When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income.  Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income.  Additionally, an increase in the general level of interest rates may also, among other things, adversely affect our current borrower's ability to repay variable rate loans, the demand for loans and the Company's ability to originate loans and decrease loan prepayment rates.  Conversely, a decrease in the general level of interest rates, among other things, may lead to prepayments on the Company's loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios and increased competition for deposits.  Accordingly, changes in the general level of market interest rates may adversely affect the Company's net yield on interest-earning assets, loan origination volume and the Company's overall results.. Although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the Company's results of operations, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.. The Company's business needs and future growth may require the Company to raise additional capital, but that capital may not be available or may be dilutive.. The Company may need to raise additional capital, in the form of debt or equity securities, in the future to have sufficient capital resources to meet its commitments and fund its business needs and future growth, particularly if the quality of the Company's assets or earnings were to deteriorate significantly.  In addition, the Company and the Bank are each required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support their operations.. The Company's ability to raise capital will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets, which are outside of the Company's control, and its financial performance.  Accordingly, the Company cannot provide assurance that such capital will be available on terms acceptable to the Company or at all.  Any occurrence that limits the Company's access to capital, may adversely affect the Company's capital costs and the Company's ability to raise capital and, in turn, its liquidity.  Further, if the Company needs to raise capital in the future, the Company may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would then have to compete with those institutions for investors.  Any inability to raise capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations and could be dilutive to both tangible book value and the Company's share price.. In addition, an inability to raise capital when needed may subject the Company to increased regulatory supervision and the imposition of restrictions on the Company's growth and business.  These restrictions could negatively affect the Company's ability to operate or further expand its operations through loan growth, acquisitions or the establishment of additional branches.  These restrictions may also result in increases in operating expenses and reductions in revenues that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and share price.. 26. Table of Contents. The Company could experience an unexpected inability to obtain needed liquidity.. Liquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due.  The liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests, to accommodate possible outflows in deposits, and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities and is essential to a financial institution's business.  The ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of its balance sheet structure, its ability to liquidate assets and its access to alternative sources of funds.  The Company seeks to ensure that its funding needs are met by maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity through asset and liability management.  In 2016, the Bank also secured liquidity under the advance program provided under terms offered by the FHLBC.  If the Company or the Bank becomes unable to obtain funds when needed, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.. Loss of customer deposits due to increased competition could increase the Company's funding costs.. The Company relies on bank deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding.  In addition, the Company's future growth will largely depend on its ability to maintain and grow a strong deposit base. If the Company is unable to continue to attract and retain core deposits, to obtain third party financing on favorable terms, or to have access to interbank or other liquidity sources, the Company may not be able to grow its assets as quickly.  The Company competes with banks and other financial services companies for deposits.  If the Company's competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits in response to interest rate changes initiated by the FRBC Open Market Committee or for other reasons of their choice, the Company's funding costs may increase, either because the Company raises its rates to avoid losing deposits or because the Company loses deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding.  Higher funding costs could reduce the Company's net interest margin and net interest income.  Any decline in available funding could adversely affect the Company's ability to continue to implement its business strategy which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.. The Company's estimate of fair values for its investments may not be realizable if it were to sell these securities today.. The Company's available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value.  The Company's held-to-maturity securities were carried at amortized cost.. The determination of fair value for securities categorized in Level 3 involves significant judgment due to the complexity of the factors contributing to the valuation, many of which are not readily observable in the market.  Recent market disruptions and the resulting fluctuations in fair value have made the valuation process even more difficult and subjective.  If the valuations are incorrect, it could harm the Company's financial results and financial condition.. The Company may be materially and adversely affected by the highly regulated environment in which it operates.. The Company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation, supervision and examination.  Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors' funds, FDIC funds, customers and the banking system as a whole, rather than the Company's stockholders.  Compliance with banking regulations is costly and these regulations affect the Company's lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, mergers and acquisitions, dividend policy, and growth, among other things.. The Company and the Bank also undergo periodic examinations by their regulators, who have extensive discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law.  Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil monetary penalties, and/or damage to the Company's reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.. A more detailed description of the primary federal and state banking laws and regulations that affect the Company and the Bank is included in this Form 10-K under the section captioned \"Supervision and Regulation\" in Item 1.  Since the economic recession, federal and state banking laws and regulations, as well as interpretations and implementations of these laws and regulations, have undergone substantial review and change.  In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act drastically revised the laws and regulations under which the Company operates.  The burden of regulatory compliance has increased under the Dodd-Frank Act and has increased the Company's costs of doing business and, as a result, may create an advantage for the Company's competitors who may not be subject to similar legislative and regulatory requirements.  Regulations and laws may be modified at any time, and new legislation may be enacted that will affect the Company or our subsidiaries.  Any future changes in federal and state laws and regulations, as well as the interpretation and implementation of such laws and regulations, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways, including those listed above or other ways that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.. The Company's deposit insurance premiums could be substantially higher in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future earnings.. The FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, up to $250,000 per account. The amount of a particular institution's deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution's risk classification under an FDIC risk-based. 27. Table of Contents. assessment system. An institution's risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to its regulators. As a result of recent FDIC assessment charges, banks are now assessed deposit insurance premiums based on the bank's average consolidated total assets less the sum of its average tangible equity, and the FDIC has modified certain risk-based adjustments, which increase or decrease a bank's overall assessment rate. This has resulted in increases to the deposit insurance assessment rates and thus raised deposit premiums for many insured depository institutions. If these increases are insufficient for the Deposit Insurance Fund to meet its funding requirements, further special assessments or increases in deposit insurance premiums may be required. The Company is generally unable to control the amount of premiums that it is required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, the Company may be required to pay higher FDIC premiums than the recent levels. Any future additional assessments, increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could reduce the Company's profitability, may limit its ability to pursue certain business opportunities or otherwise negatively impact its operations.. The Company is subject to federal and state fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.. Federal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution's performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to the Company's performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact the Company's rating under the Community Reinvestment Act and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact the Company's reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.. The financial services industry, as well as the broader economy, may be subject to new legislation, regulation, and government policy.. At this time, it is difficult to predict the legislative and regulatory changes that will result from the current Presidential administration. However, both the President and senior members of the House of Representatives have advocated for significant reduction of financial services regulation, to include amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act and structural changes to the CFPB. The current administration and Congress also may cause broader economic changes due to changes in governing ideology and governing style. New appointments to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve could affect monetary policy and interest rates, and changes in fiscal policy could affect broader patterns of trade and economic growth. Future legislation, regulation, and government policy could affect the banking industry as a whole, including the Company's business and results of operations, in ways that are difficult to predict. In addition, the Company's results of operations also could be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies.. The Company's ability to realize its deferred tax asset may be reduced, which may adversely impact its results of operations.. Deferred tax assets are reported as assets on the Company's balance sheet and represent the decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of net operating losses (\"NOLs\") and tax credit carryforwards and because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by enacted tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $25.4 million, which included deferred tax assets for a federal net operating loss carryforward of $7.2 million that is expected to expire in 2031 thru 2033.  Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income during the periods in which existing deferred tax assets are expected to become deductible for income tax purposes.  Based on projections of future taxable income in periods in which deferred tax assets are expected to become deductible, management determined that the realization of the Company's net deferred tax asset was more likely than not.  As a result, the Company did not recognize a valuation allowance on its net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016.     If it becomes more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be recognized.   In July 2017, the State of Illinois enacted an income tax rate increase which resulted in the Company recording an additional income tax benefit and increase to the deferred tax asset of $1.6 million.  In December 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law, which reduced the corporate federal income tax rate to 21% and resulted in a $9.5 million write-down of the Company's deferred tax asset in the fourth quarter of 2017, through income tax expense.  These tax rate changes, in conjunction with the Company's net income in 2017, have resulted in a significant reduction of the deferred tax asset over the last year.  The Company's deferred tax asset may be further reduced in the future if estimates of future income or our tax planning strategies do not support the amount of the deferred tax assets.  Charges to establish a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax asset could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.. The Company and its subsidiaries could become subject to claims and litigation pertaining to the Company's or the Bank's fiduciary responsibility.. Customers make claims and on occasion take legal action pertaining to the Company's performance of its fiduciary responsibilities.  Whether customer claims and legal action related to the Company's performance of its fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal action are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they may result in significant. 28. Table of Contents. financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of the Company and its products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services.  Any financial liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operations.. The Company depends on its executive officers and other key employees, and its ability to attract additional key personnel, to continue the implementation of the Company's long-term business strategy, and the Company could be harmed by the unexpected loss of their services.. The Company believes that its continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of its executive officers and other key employees and its ability to motivate and retain these individuals, as well as its ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management and other skilled employees.  The Company's business is primarily relationship-driven in that many of its key personnel have extensive customer or asset management relationships.  Loss of key personnel with such relationships may lead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor or if asset management expertise was not timely replaced.  Competition for employees is intense, and the process of locating key personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute the Company's business strategy may be lengthy.  We may not be successful in retaining key personnel, and the unexpected loss of services of one or more of the Company's key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business because of their skill, knowledge of the Company's primary markets, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.  If the services of any of the Company's key personnel should become unavailable for any reason, the Company may not be able to identify and hire qualified persons on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operation and future prospects.. The Company's information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security and cyber-attacks, all if which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.. The Company relies heavily on internal and outsourced technologies, communications, and information systems to conduct its business.  Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Company collects, processes and retains sensitive and confidential information regarding our customers.  As the Company's reliance on technology has increased, so have the potential risks of a technology-related operation interruption (such as disruptions in the Company's customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, or other systems) or the occurrence of a cyber-attack (such as unauthorized access to the Company's systems).  These risks have increased for all financial institutions as new technologies have emerged, including the use of the Internet and the expansion of telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions, and as the sophistication of organized criminals, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others have increased.. In addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers recently have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions, particularly denial of service attacks, that are designed to disrupt key business services, such as customer-facing web sites.  The Company operates in an industry where otherwise effective preventive measures against security breaches become vulnerable as breach strategies change frequently and cyber-attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources.  It is possible that a cyber incident, such as a security breach, may be undetected for a period of time.  However, applying guidance from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, the Company has identified security risks and employs risk mitigation controls.  Following a layered security approach, the Company has analyzed and will continue to analyze security related to device specific considerations, user access topics, transaction-processing and network integrity.  The Company expects that it will spend additional time and will incur additional cost going forward to modify and enhance protective measures and that effort and spending will continue to be required to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.. The Company also faces risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card and debit card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding the Company's customers through various third parties, including merchant acquiring banks, payment processors, payment card networks and its processors.  Some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyber-attacks. Because these third parties and related environments such as the point-of-sale are not under the Company's direct control  future security breaches or cyber-attacks affecting any of these third parties could impact the Company and in some cases the Company may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks.  The Company offers its customers protection against fraud and attendant losses for unauthorized use of debit cards in order to stay competitive in the market place.  Offering such protection exposes the Company to potential losses which, in the event of a data breach at one or more retailers of considerable magnitude, may adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operation.   Further cyber-attacks or other breaches in the future, whether affecting the Company or others, could intensify consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in reduced use of payment cards and increased costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.  To the extent we are involved in any future cyber-attacks or other breaches, the Company's reputation could be affected with a potentially material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.. The Company is dependent upon outside third parties for the processing and handling of Company records and data.. The Company relies on software developed by third party vendors to process various Company transactions.  In some cases, the Company has contracted with third parties to run their proprietary software on behalf of the Company at a location under the control of. 29. Table of Contents. the third party.  These systems include, but are not limited to, core data processing, payroll, wealth management record keeping, and securities portfolio management.  While the Company performs a review of controls instituted by the vendor over these programs in accordance with industry standards and institutes its own user controls, the Company must rely on the continued maintenance of the performance controls by these outside parties, including safeguards over the security of customer data.  In addition, the Company creates backup copies of key processing output daily in the event of a failure on the part of any of these systems.  Nonetheless, the Company may incur a temporary disruption in its ability to conduct its business or process its transactions, or incur damage to its reputation if a third party vendor fails to adequately maintain internal controls or institute necessary changes to systems.  A disruption or breach of security may ultimately have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.. The Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in a variety of litigation and other actions.. Currently, there are certain other legal proceedings pending against the Company and its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business.  While the outcome of any legal proceeding is inherently uncertain, based on information currently available, the Company's management believes that any liabilities arising from pending legal matters would not have a material adverse effect on the Bank or on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.  However, if actual results differ from management's expectations, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.. Risks Related to the Company's Proposed Merger with Greater Chicago Financial Corp. (\"Greater Chicago Financial\"). Combining with Greater Chicago Financial may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized.. The Company and Greater Chicago Financial have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on the Company's and Greater Chicago Financial's ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of the Company and Greater Chicago Financial in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt the existing customer relations or result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of either company's ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company's ability to maintain relationships with customers, depositors, clients and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger.  If the combined companies experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. There also may be business disruptions that cause the Company and/or Greater Chicago Financial to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from the Company and/or Greater Chicago Financial and move their business to competing financial institutions. Integration efforts will also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of the Company and Greater Chicago Financial during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the merger on the combined company.. Additionally, the combined company may not be able to successfully achieve the level of cost savings, revenue enhancements and other synergies that it expects, and may not be able to capitalize upon the existing customer relationships of each party to the extent anticipated, or it may take longer, or be more difficult or expensive than expected, to achieve these goals. These circumstances could have an adverse effect on the combined company's business, results of operation and stock price.. 30. Table of Contents. The merger may distract the Company's management from their other responsibilities.. The merger could cause the Company's management to focus their time and energies on matters related to the merger that otherwise would be directed to the Company's business and operations. Any such distraction on the part of the Company's management, if significant, could affect the Company's ability to service existing business and develop new business and adversely affect its business and earnings before the merger, or the business and earnings of the combined company after the merger.. Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the merger.. Before the merger may be completed, the Company must obtain approvals (or waivers of such approvals) from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Other approvals, waivers or consents from regulators may also be required. These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger. Although the Company does not currently expect that any such conditions or changes would be imposed, there can be no assurance that they will not be, and such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger, any of which might have an adverse effect on the combined company following the merger.. If the merger with Greater Chicago Financial is not completed, the Company will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger.. The Company has incurred and will continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement with Greater Chicago Financial. If the merger is not completed, we would have to recognize these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger.. Risks Associated with the Company's Common Stock. The Company has not established a minimum dividend payment level, and it cannot ensure its ability to pay dividends in the future.. For several years prior to January 2014, the Company was under a Written Agreement with the Federal Reserve that included among other requirements and restrictions, limitations on the Company's payment of dividends on its common stock.  Although the Written Agreement was terminated in January 2014, the Company only resumed paying dividends during the second quarter of 2016 on its common stock.. Despite the termination of the Written Agreement, the Company is still subject to various restrictions on its ability to pay dividends imposed by the Federal Reserve.  The Company is also subject to the limitations of the DGCL.  The DGCL allows the Company to pay dividends only out of its surplus (as defined and computed in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL) or, if the Company has no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year.  In addition, the Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from our bank subsidiary. The Company's principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders and principal and interest on our outstanding debt, is dividends from the Bank. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company, as well as by us to our stockholders.   If the Bank is unable to make dividend payments to the Company and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, the Company may not be able to make dividend payments to its stockholders.. Holders of the Company's common stock are also only entitled to receive such dividends as the Company's board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments.. The trading volumes in the Company's common stock may not provide adequate liquidity for investors.. Shares of the Company's common stock are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market; however, the average daily trading volume in its common stock is less than that of most larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of a sufficient number of willing buyers and sellers of the common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which the Company has no control.  Given the current daily average trading volume of the Company's common stock, significant sales of the Company's common stock in a brief period of time, or the expectation of these sales, could cause a significant decline in the price of the Company's common stock.. 31. Table of Contents. The trading price of the Company's common stock may be subject to continued significant fluctuations and volatility.. The market price of the Company's common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in its operating and financial results, particularly if such results vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors, including with respect to further loan and lease losses the Company may incur;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements regarding significant transactions in which the Company may engage;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmarket assessments regarding such transactions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges or perceived changes in its operations or business prospects;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlegislative or regulatory changes affecting its industry generally or its businesses and operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe failure of general market and economic conditions to stabilize and recover, particularly with respect to economic conditions in Illinois, and the pace of any such stabilization and recovery;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe operating and share price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to the Company;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfuture offerings by the Company of debt, preferred stock or trust preferred securities, each of which would be senior to its common stock upon liquidation and for purposes of dividend distributions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactions of its current stockholders, including future sales of common stock by existing stockholders and its directors and executive officers; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother changes in U.S. or global financial markets, economies and market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility.. Stock markets in general, and the Company's common stock in particular, have experienced significant volatility since 2007 and continue to experience significant price and volume volatility. As a result, the market price of the Company's common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations that may or may not be related to its operating performance or prospects. Increased volatility could result in a decline in the market price of the Company's common stock.. Shares of the Company's common stock are subject to dilution, which could cause the Company's common stock price to decline.. The Company is generally not restricted from issuing additional shares of its common stock up to the number of shares authorized in its Certificate of Incorporation.  The Company may issue additional shares of its common stock (or securities convertible into common stock) in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance the Company's operations and business strategy (including mergers and acquisitions), to adjust its ratio of debt to equity, to address regulatory capital concerns, or to satisfy the Company's obligations upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants. The Company may issue equity securities in transactions that generate cash proceeds, transactions that free up regulatory capital but do not immediately generate or preserve substantial amounts of cash, and transactions that generate regulatory or balance sheet capital only and do not generate or preserve cash. If the Company chooses to raise capital by selling shares of its common stock or securities convertible into common stock for any reason, the issuance would have a dilutive effect on the holders of the Company's common stock and could have a material negative effect on the market price of the Company's common stock.. Certain banking laws and the Company's governing documents may have an anti-takeover effect.. Certain federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to the Company's stockholders. In addition, the Company has a classified board of directors and has adopted an Amended and Restated Rights Plan and Tax Benefits Preservation Plan as amended (the \"Rights Plan\"), which expires on September 12, 2018, and is intended to discourage any person from acquiring 5% or more of the Company's outstanding stock (with certain limited exceptions), in order to help preserve the value of its deferred tax asset. The combination of these provisions may inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of the Company's common stock."
