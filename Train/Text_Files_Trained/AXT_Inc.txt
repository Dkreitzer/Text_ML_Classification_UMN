[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. For ease of reference, we have divided these risks and uncertainties into the following general categories:. I. \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisks related to our general business;. II. \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisks related to international aspects of our business;. III. \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisks related to our financial results and capital structure;. IV. \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisks related to our intellectual property; and. V. \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisks related to compliance, environmental regulations and other legal matters.. 15. Table of Contents. I.           Risks Related to Our General Business. Silicon substrates (wafers) are significantly lower in cost compared to substrates made from specialty materials, and new silicon-based technologies could enable silicon based substrates to replace specialty material based substrates for certain applications.. Historically silicon wafers or substrates are less expensive than specialty material substrates, such as those that we produce.  Electronic circuit designers will generally consider silicon first and only turn to alternative materials if silicon cannot provide the required functionality in terms of power consumption, speed, wave lengths or other specifications.  Beginning in 2011, certain applications that had previously used GaAs substrates adopted a new silicon-based technology called silicon on  insulator, or SOI. SOI technology uses a silicon-insulator-silicon layered substrate in place of conventional silicon substrates in semiconductor manufacturing. SOI substrates cost less than GaAs substrates and, although their performance is not as robust as GaAs substrates in terms of power consumption, heat generation and speed, they became acceptable in mobile phones and other applications that were previously dominated by GaAs substrates.  The adoption of SOI resulted in decreased GaAs wafer demand, and decreased revenue. If SOI or similar technologies gain more widespread market acceptance, or are used in more applications, our sales of specialty material based substrates could be reduced and our business and operating results could be significantly and adversely affected.. Our gross margin has fluctuated historically and may decline due to several factors.. Our gross margin has fluctuated from period to period as a result of shifts in the cost of raw materials, shifts in product mix, the introduction of new products, decreases in average selling prices for products, utilization of our manufacturing capacity, fluctuations in manufacturing yields and our ability to reduce product costs. These factors and other variables change from period to period and these fluctuations are expected to continue in the future.. Further, we do not control the prices at which our subsidiaries and other joint venture companies sell their raw material products to third parties and we do not control their production process. However, because we consolidate the results of three of these companies with our own, any reduction in their gross margins could have a significant, adverse impact on our overall gross margins. One or more of our companies has in the past sold, and may in the future sell, raw materials at significantly reduced prices in order to gain volume sales or sales to new customers. In addition, at some points in the last three years, the market price of gallium dropped below our per unit inventory cost and we incurred an inventory write down under the lower of cost or net realizable value accounting rules. In such events, our gross margin is adversely impacted.. Underutilizing our manufacturing facilities may result in declines in our gross margins.. An important factor in our success is the extent to which we are able to utilize the available capacity in our manufacturing facilities. A number of factors and circumstances may reduce utilization rates, including periods of industry overcapacity, low levels of customer orders, operating inefficiencies, mechanical failures and disruption of operations due to expansion, power interruptions, fire, flood or other natural disasters or calamities. Because many portions of our manufacturing costs are relatively fixed, high utilization rates are critical to our gross margins and operating results. If we fail to achieve acceptable manufacturing volumes or experience product shipment delays, our results of operations will be negatively affected. During periods of decreased demand, we have underutilized our manufacturing lines. If we are unable to improve utilization levels at our facilities during periods of decreased demand and correctly manage capacity, the fixed expense levels will have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in the three months ended December 31, 2015, our revenue dropped to $18.1 million and our gross margin was only 17.1%.. In 2013, we concluded that incoming orders were insufficient and that we were significantly underutilizing our factory capacity. As a result, in February 2014, we announced a restructuring plan with respect to our wholly-owned subsidiary, Beijing Tongmei Xtal Technology Co, Ltd., or Tongmei, in order to better align manufacturing capacity with demand. Under the restructuring plan, we recorded a charge of approximately $907,000 in the first quarter of 2014. In the second quarter of 2016, we restructured the operations of Beijing JiYa Semiconductor Material Co., Ltd., one of our partially owned consolidated subsidiaries, which resulted in a reduction in force of 28 positions that were no longer. 16. Table of Contents. required to support production and operations.. If we receive fewer customer orders than forecasted or if our customers delay or cancel orders, we may not be able to reduce our manufacturing costs in the short-term and our gross margins would be negatively affected. In addition, lead times required by our customers are shrinking, which reduces our ability to forecast orders and properly balance our capacity utilization.. If we have low product yields, the shipment of our products may be delayed and our product cost and operating results may be adversely impacted.. A critical factor in our product cost is yield. Our products are manufactured using complex crystal growth and wafer processing technologies, and the number of usable wafer substrates we produce can fluctuate as a result of many factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpoor control of furnace temperature and pressure;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timpurities in the materials used;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontamination of the manufacturing environment;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tquality control and inconsistency in quality levels;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlack of automation and inconsistent processing requiring manual manufacturing steps;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsubstrate breakage during the manufacturing process; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tequipment failure, power outages or variations in the manufacturing process.. A current example where yield is of special concern is for our six-inch semi-conducting gallium arsenide substrates, which can be used for manufacturing opto-electronic devices in cell phones, enabling 3-D sensing.  This application requires very low defect densities, also called etch pit densities, and our yields will be lower than the yields achieved for the same substrate when it will be used in other applications.  If we are unable to achieve the targeted quantity of low defect density substrates, then our manufacturing costs would increase and our gross margins would be negatively impacted.. In addition, we may modify our process to meet a customer specification, but this can impact our yields. If our yields decrease, our revenue could decline if we are unable to produce products to our customers' requirements. At the same time, our manufacturing costs could remain fixed, or could increase. Lower yields negatively impact our gross margin. We have experienced product shipment delays and difficulties in achieving acceptable yields on both new and older products, and delays and poor yields have adversely affected our operating results. We may experience similar problems in the future and we cannot predict when they may occur,  their duration or severity.. If our manufacturing processes result in defects in our products making them unfit for use by our customers, our products would be rejected, resulting in compensation costs paid to our customers, and possible disqualification. This could lead to revenue loss and market share loss.. Risks exist in relocating our gallium arsenide manufacturing operations.. The Chinese government has imposed, and may impose in the future, manufacturing restrictions and regulations that require us to move part of our manufacturing operations to a location outside of the Beijing area or temporarily cease or limit manufacturing. Such relocation, or other restrictions on manufacturing, could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition.. 17. Table of Contents. The Beijing city government is expanding its offices into the area where our manufacturing facility is currently located and is in the process of moving thousands of government employees into this area.  The Beijing city government desires to upgrade this area and has applied pressure on manufacturing companies to relocate, including us.  We are cooperating with the government and, in accordance with our relocation plan, are relocating our gallium arsenide production line to the city of Dingxing, which is approximately a 90 minute drive south of our current Beijing facility.  In addition, we have acquired a smaller site in Kazuo, located in the province of Liaoning near the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and under the jurisdiction of the prefecture-level city of Chaoyang, which will initially be used for the synthesis of raw gallium and raw arsenic as well as ingot growth.  Additional environmental permits, regulatory approvals and zoning conformance applications are in process for both sites.  Given the fluidity and ever-increasing review of environmental and regulatory ordinances in China, there can be no assurance that these matters will be completed smoothly or at all.. The relocation of our gallium arsenide production line requires us to accurately execute our relocation plan.  We expect that our major customers will want to examine and qualify the wafer substrates produced at the new site before placing volume purchase orders for products produced at the new site.  A failure to properly execute our relocation plan could result in disruption to our production and have a material adverse impact on our revenue and our results of operations and financial condition.  If we fail to meet the product qualification requirements of a customer, we may lose sales to that customer.  Our reputation may also be damaged.  Any loss of sales could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and our results of operations and financial condition.  For example, product qualification of our low EPD wafer substrates for 3-D sensing applications will be required and a failure to satisfy all of the qualification standards could result in no orders for this opportunity.. We expect many of the key employees who are employed at our current manufacturing facility to relocate to the new sites or commute under a program we will develop.  There can be no assurances that the key employees will relocate or that we will be able to hire qualified employees for our new manufacturing facilities.  A loss of key employees and our inability to hire qualified employees could disrupt our production, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition.. We do not yet have comprehensive construction bids for further modifications to the existing buildings, new buildings or third party estimates for the complete relocation costs, but we believe these costs will be in the range of $40 million to $50 million, which includes the amount we have already paid for the purchase of our new manufacturing facilities and will extend into 2019.  However, such costs could be more expensive, particularly as we are now contemplating a larger facility that will enable us to rapidly add furnaces and other necessary production equipment to serve the anticipated demand for 3-D sensing VCSELs and other high-end applications.. The Chinese government has in the past imposed temporary restrictions on manufacturing facilities, such as the restrictions imposed on polluting factories for the 2008 Olympics and the 2014 Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation event.  These restrictions included a shut-down of the transportation of materials and power plants to reduce air pollution. To reduce air pollution in Beijing, the Chinese government has sometimes limited the construction of new, or expansion of existing, facilities by manufacturing companies in the Beijing area. If the government applies similar restrictions to us, then such restrictions could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and our financial condition.  Our ability to supply current or new orders could be significantly impacted. Customers could then be required to purchase products from our competitors, causing our competitors to take market share from us.. In addition, from time to time, the Chinese government issues new regulations, which may require additional actions on our part to comply.  On February 27, 2015, the China State Administration of Work Safety updated its list of hazardous substances.  The previous list, which was published in 2002, did not restrict the materials that we use in our wafers.  The new list added gallium arsenide.  As a result of the newly published list, we were instructed to obtain a permit to continue to manufacture our gallium arsenide substrate wafers.  The Beijing municipal authority accepted our permit application in May 2015, but has not issued to us the requisite permit while we continue to make preparations in good faith to relocate our gallium arsenide production.  If our application is denied in the future before we complete our relocation, then our gallium arsenide production could be disrupted, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition.. 18. Table of Contents. Customers may require that they re-qualify our gallium arsenide wafer substrates from the new manufacturing line.. We are required by the China central government to move our gallium arsenide production so that it is not within Beijing and are in the process of complying.  Our larger customers will view this as a process engineering change and their internal quality control system will require them to re-qualify our product and ensure that the product characteristics still conform to their specifications.  Delays in this qualification process or failures to re-qualify could result in a reduction of orders and have a material adverse effect on our revenue.. If any of our facilities are damaged by occurrences such as fire, explosion, power outage or natural disaster, we might not be able to manufacture our products.. The ongoing operation of our manufacturing and production facilities in China is critical to our ability to meet demand for our products. If we are not able to use all or a significant portion of our facilities for prolonged periods for any reason, we would not be able to manufacture products for our customers. For example, a fire or explosion caused by our use of combustible chemicals,  high furnace temperatures or, in the case of InP, high pressure during our manufacturing processes could render some or all of our facilities inoperable for an indefinite period of time. Actions outside of our control, such as earthquakes or other natural disasters, could also damage our facilities, rendering them inoperable. If we are unable to operate our facilities and manufacture our products, we would lose customers and revenue and our business would be harmed.. On the evening of March 15, 2017, an electrical short-circuit fire occurred at our Beijing manufacturing facility.  The electrical power supply supporting 2-inch, 3-inch and 4-inch gallium arsenide and germanium crystal growth was damaged and production in that area was stopped.  In addition, a waste water pipe was damaged resulting in a halt to wafer processing for four days until the pipe could be repaired.  We were able to rotate key furnace hardware and use some of the 6-inch capacity for smaller diameter crystal growth production to mitigate the impact of the fire and resume production. If we are unable to recover from a fire or natural disaster, our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.. Demand for our products may decrease if demand for the end-user applications decrease or if manufacturers downstream in our supply chain experience difficulty manufacturing, marketing or selling their products.. Our products are used to produce components for electronic and opto-electronic products. Accordingly, demand for our products is subject to the demand for end-user applications which utilize our products, as well as factors affecting the ability of the manufacturers downstream in our supply chain to introduce and market their products successfully, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe competition such manufacturers face in their particular industries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe technical, manufacturing, sales, marketing and management capabilities of such manufacturers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe financial and other resources of such manufacturers; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability of such manufacturers to sell their products if they infringe third - party intellectual property rights.. If demand for the end-user applications for which our products are used decreases, or if manufacturers downstream in our supply chain are unable to develop, market and sell their products, demand for our products will decrease. For example, in the second half of 2016 manufacturers producing and selling passive optical network devices known as EPONs and GPONs experienced a slowdown in demand resulting in surplus inventory on hand.  This resulted in a slowdown of sales of our InP substrates.  We expect similar cycles of strong demand and then lower demand will occur for various InP, GaAs or Ge substrates in the future.. 19. Table of Contents. Our revenue, gross margins and profitability can be hurt if the average sales price of the various raw materials in our partially owned companies decreases.. Although the companies in our vertically integrated supply chain have historically made a positive contribution to our financial performance, when the average selling prices for the raw materials produced decline, this results in a negative impact on our revenue, gross margin and profitability.  For example, the average selling prices for 4N gallium and for germanium were driven down by oversupply in 2015, 2016 and 2017, and negatively impacted our financial results. In 2017 and 2016, the seven companies accounted for under the equity method of accounting contributed a loss of $1.7 and $2.0 million, respectively, to our consolidated financial statements.  There can be no assurance that the oversupply will be corrected by the market. Further, in several quarters over the past three years, one of our consolidated subsidiaries incurred a lower of cost or net realizable value inventory write down, which negatively impacted our consolidated gross margin. In the first quarter of 2017 we incurred an impairment charge of $313,000 against one of our partially owned suppliers, writing down our investment to zero value. If the pricing environment remains stressed by oversupply and our joint venture companies cannot reduce their production cost, then the reduced average selling prices of the raw materials produced by our joint venture companies will have a continuing adverse impact on our revenue, gross margins and net profit.. Problems incurred in our 10 partially owned joint venture companies or investment partners could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.. We have invested in 10 subsidiaries and joint venture companies in China that produce materials including 99.99% pure gallium (4N Ga), high purity gallium (7N Ga), arsenic, germanium, germanium dioxide, pyrolytic boron nitride (pBN) crucibles and boron oxide (B2O3). We purchase a portion of the materials produced by these companies for our use and they sell the remainder of their production to third parties. Our ownership and the ownership held by our consolidated subsidiaries in these companies range from 20% to 83%. We consolidate the companies in which we have a majority or controlling financial interest and employ equity accounting for the companies in which we have a smaller ownership interest. Several of these companies occupy space within larger facilities owned and/or operated by one of the other investment partners. Several of these partners are engaged in other manufacturing activities at or near the same facility. In some facilities, we share access to certain functions, including water, hazardous waste treatment or air quality treatment. If a partner in any of these ventures experiences problems with its operations, disruptions of our joint venture operations could result, having a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operation of our joint venture companies, and correspondingly on our financial condition or results of operations. For example, since gallium is a by-product of aluminum, our raw gallium joint venture in China, which is housed in and receives services from an affiliated aluminum plant, could generate lower production of gallium as a result of reduced services provided by the aluminum plant. Accordingly, in order to meet customer supply obligations, our supply chain may have to source materials from another independent third party supplier, resulting in reduced gross margin.. In addition, if any of our joint venture companies or investment partners with which our joint ventures share facilities is deemed to have violated applicable laws, rules or regulations governing the use, storage, discharge or disposal of hazardous chemicals, the operations of that joint venture could be adversely affected and we could be subject to substantial liability for clean-up efforts, personal injury, fines or suspension or termination of our joint venture's operations. Employees working for our joint ventures or any of the other investment partners could bring litigation against us as a result of actions taken at the joint venture or investment partner facilities, even though we are not directly controlling those operations.  While we would expect to defend ourselves vigorously in any litigation that is brought against us, litigation is inherently uncertain and it is possible that our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be affected. Even if we are not deemed responsible for the actions of the joint ventures or investment partners, litigation could be costly, time consuming to defend and divert management attention; in addition, if we are deemed to be the most financially viable of the partners, plaintiffs may decide to pursue us for damages.. The China central government has become increasingly concerned about environmental hazards.  Air pollution is a well-known problem in Beijing and other parts of China.  In days of severe air pollution the government has ordered manufacturing companies to stop all production.  The central government is tightening control over hazardous chemicals and other hazardous elements such as arsenic, which is produced by two of our joint venture companies.  Similarly, a company's failure to meet the ever tightening standards for control of hazardous chemicals or hazardous elements could. 20. Table of Contents. result in fines or shut downs.  Any such orders directed at one of our joint venture companies could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.. Intense competition in the markets for our products could prevent us from increasing revenue and sustaining profitability.. The markets for our products are intensely competitive. We face competition for our substrate products from other manufacturers of substrates, such as Sumitomo, Japan Energy, Freiberger, Umicore, and CCTC and from companies, such as Qorvo and Skyworks, that are actively considering alternative materials to GaAs and marketing semiconductor devices using these alternative materials. We believe that at least two of our major competitors are shipping high volumes of GaAs substrates manufactured using a process similar to our VGF process technology. Other competitors may develop and begin using similar technology. Sumitomo and Japan Energy also compete with us in the InP market. If we are unable to compete effectively, our revenue may not increase and we may not maintain profitability. We face many competitors that have a number of significant advantages over us, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgreater name recognition and market share in the business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmore manufacturing experience;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\textensive intellectual property; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsignificantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources.. Our competitors could develop new or enhanced products that are more effective than our products.. The level and intensity of competition has increased over the past years and we expect competition to continue to increase in the future. Competitive pressures have resulted in reductions in the prices of our products, and continued or increased competition could reduce our market share, require us to further reduce the prices of our products, affect our ability to recover costs and result in reduced gross margins and profitability.. In addition, new competitors have and may continue to emerge, such as a crystal growing company established by a former employee in China that is supplying semi-conducting GaAs wafers to the LED market. Competition from sources such as this could increase, particularly if these competitors are able to obtain large capital investments.. The average selling prices of our substrates may decline over relatively short periods, which may reduce our revenue and gross margins.. Since the market for our products is characterized by declining average selling prices resulting from various factors, such as increased competition, overcapacity, the introduction of new products and decreased sales of products incorporating our products, the average selling prices for our products may decline over relatively short time periods. We have in the past experienced, and in the future may experience, substantial period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to declining average selling prices.  In certain years, we have experienced an average selling price decline of our substrate selling prices of approximately 5% to 10%, depending on the substrate product. It is possible that the pace of the decline of average selling prices could accelerate beyond these levels for certain products in a commoditizing market. We anticipate that average selling prices will decrease in the future in response to the unstable demand environment, price reductions by competitors, or by other factors, including pricing pressures from significant customers.  When our average selling prices decline, our revenue and gross profit decline, unless we are able to sell more products or reduce the cost to manufacture our products. We generally attempt to combat an average selling price decline by improving yields and manufacturing efficiencies and working to reduce the costs of our raw materials and of manufacturing our products. We have in the past, and may in the future, experience declining selling prices, which could negatively impact our revenues, gross profits and financial results. We, therefore, need to sell our current products in increasing volumes to offset any decline in their average selling prices, and introduce new products, which we may not be able to do, or do on a timely basis.. 21. Table of Contents. We may be unable to reduce the cost of our products sufficiently to enable us to compete with others. Our cost reduction efforts may not allow us to keep pace with competitive pricing pressures and could adversely affect our margins. In order to remain competitive, we must continually work to reduce the cost of manufacturing our products. There is no assurance that any changes effected by us will result in sufficient cost reductions to allow us to reduce the price of our products to remain competitive or improve our gross margins.. Defects in our products could diminish demand for our products.. Our wafer products are complex and may contain defects, including defects resulting from impurities inherent in our raw materials or inconsistencies in our manufacturing processes. We have experienced quality control problems with some of our products, which caused customers to return products to us, reduce orders for our products, or both. If we experience quality control problems, or experience other manufacturing problems, customers may return product for credit, cancel or reduce orders or purchase products from our competitors. We may be unable to maintain or increase sales to our customers and sales of our products could decline. Defects in our products could cause us to incur higher manufacturing costs and suffer product returns and additional service expenses, all of which could adversely impact our operating results. If new products developed by us contain defects when released, our customers may be dissatisfied and we may suffer negative publicity or customer claims against us, lose sales or experience delays in market acceptance of our new products.. Our substrate products have a long qualification cycle that makes it difficult to forecast revenue from new customers or for new products sold to existing customers.. New customers typically place orders with us for our substrate products three months to a year or more after our initial contact with them. The sale of our products is subject to our customers' lengthy internal evaluation and approval processes. During this time, we may incur substantial expenses and expend sales, marketing and management efforts while the customers evaluate our products. These expenditures may not result in sales of our products. If we do not achieve anticipated sales in a period as expected, we may experience an unplanned shortfall in our revenue. As a result, our operating results would be adversely affected. In addition, if we fail to meet the product qualification requirements of the customer, we may not have another opportunity to sell that product to that customer for many months or even years. In the current competitive climate, the average qualification and sales cycle for our products has lengthened even further and is expected to continue to make it difficult for us to forecast our future sales accurately. We anticipate that sales of any future substrate products will also have lengthy qualification periods and will, therefore, be subject to risks substantially similar to those inherent in the lengthy sales cycles of our current substrate products.. The loss of one or more of our key substrate customers would significantly hurt our operating results.. From time to time, sales to one or more of our customers individually represent more than 10% of our revenue and if we were to lose a major customer the loss would negatively impact our revenue. Most of our customers are not obligated to purchase a specified quantity of our products or to provide us with binding forecasts of product purchases. In addition, our customers may reduce, delay or cancel orders. In the past, we have experienced a slowdown in bookings, significant push-outs and cancellation of orders from customers. If we lose a major customer or if a customer cancels, reduces or delays orders, our revenue would decline. In addition, customers that have accounted for significant revenue in the past may not continue to generate revenue for us in any future period. Any loss of customers or any delay in scheduled shipments of our products could cause revenue to fall below our expectations and the expectations of market analysts or investors, causing our stock price to decline.. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may limit our ability to maintain or increase net sales and operating results during industry downturns.. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and periodically experiences significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand, resulting in production overcapacity and excess inventory in the markets we serve. A downturn can result in lower unit volumes and rapid erosion of average selling prices. The semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles of both semiconductor companies' and their customers' products or a decline in general economic conditions. This may. 22. Table of Contents. adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our business.. Our continuing business depends in significant part upon manufacturers of electronic and opto-electronic compound semiconductor devices, as well as the current and anticipated market demand for these devices and products using these devices. As a supplier to the compound semiconductor industry, we are subject to the business cycles that characterize the industry. The timing, length and volatility of these cycles are difficult to predict. The compound semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical due to sudden changes in demand, the amount of manufacturing capacity and changes in the technology employed in compound semiconductors. The rate of changes in demand, including end demand, is high, and the effect of these changes upon us occurs quickly, exacerbating the volatility of these cycles. These changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers' purchases and investments in new technology. These industry cycles create pressure on our revenue, gross margin and net income.. Our industry has in the past experienced periods of oversupply and that has resulted in significantly reduced prices for compound semiconductor devices and components, including our products, both as a result of general economic changes and overcapacity. Oversupply causes greater price competition and can cause our revenue, gross margins and net income to decline. During periods of weak demand, customers typically reduce purchases, delay delivery of products and/or cancel orders for our products. Order cancellations, reductions in order size or delays in orders could occur and would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Actions to reduce our costs may be insufficient to align our structure with prevailing business conditions. We may be required to undertake additional cost-cutting measures, and may be unable to invest in marketing, research and development and engineering at the levels we believe are necessary to maintain our competitive position. Our failure to make these investments could seriously harm our business.. A significant portion of our operating expense and manufacturing costs are relatively fixed. If revenue for a particular quarter is lower than we expect, we likely will be unable to proportionately reduce our operating expenses or fixed manufacturing costs for that quarter, which would harm our operating results.. If we do not successfully develop new product features and improvements and new products that respond to customer requirements, our ability to generate revenue, obtain new customers, and retain existing customers may suffer.. Our success depends on our ability to offer new product features, improved performance characteristics and new products, such as larger diameter substrates, low defect density substrates, thicker or thinner substrates, substrates with extreme surface flatness specifications, substrates that are manufactured with a doped crystal growth process or substrates that incorporate leading technology and other technological advances. New products must meet customer needs and compete effectively on quality, price and performance. The markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change, changing customer needs and evolving industry standards. If our competitors introduce products employing new technologies or performance characteristics, our existing products could become obsolete and unmarketable. During the past few years, we have seen our competitors selling more substrates manufactured using a crystal growth technology similar to ours, which has eroded our technological differentiation.. The development of new product features, improved performance characteristics and new products can be a highly complex process, and we may experience delays in developing and introducing them. Any significant delay could cause us to fail to timely introduce and gain market acceptance of new products. Further, the costs involved in researching, developing and engineering new products could be greater than anticipated. If we fail to offer new products or product enhancements or fail to achieve higher quality products, we may not generate sufficient revenue to offset our development costs and other expenses or meet our customers' requirements.. We have made and may continue to make strategic investments in raw materials suppliers, which may not be successful and may result in the loss of all or part of our investment.. We have made direct investments or investments through our subsidiaries in 10 raw material suppliers in China, which provide us with opportunities to gain supplies of key raw materials that are important to our substrate business. These affiliates each have a market beyond that provided by us. We do not have significant influence over every one of these companies and in some we have made only a strategic, minority investment. We may not be successful in. 23. Table of Contents. achieving the financial, technological or commercial advantage upon which any given investment is premised, and we could end up losing all or part of our investment which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. In the first quarter of 2017, we incurred an impairment charge of $313,000 against one of our partially owned suppliers, writing down our investment to zero value.. We purchase critical raw materials and parts for our equipment from single or limited sources, and could lose sales if these sources fail to fill our needs.. We depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components and equipment used in manufacturing our products, including key materials such as quartz tubing, and polishing solutions. We generally purchase these materials through standard purchase orders and not pursuant to long-term supply contracts, and no supplier guarantees supply of raw materials or equipment to us. If we lose any of our key suppliers, our manufacturing efforts could be significantly hampered and we could be prevented from timely producing and delivering products to our customers. Prior to investing in our subsidiaries and joint ventures, we sometimes experienced delays obtaining critical raw materials and spare parts, including gallium and we could experience such delays again in the future due to shortages of materials or for other reasons. Delays in receiving equipment or materials could result in higher costs and cause us to delay or reduce production of our products. If we have to delay or reduce production, we could fail to meet customer delivery schedules and our revenue and operating results could suffer.. We may not be able to identify or form additional complementary joint ventures.. Although we are not currently pursuing additional joint ventures, in the future, we might invest in additional joint venture companies in order to remain competitive in our marketplace and ensure a supply of critical raw materials. However, we may not be able to identify additional complementary joint venture opportunities or, even once opportunities are identified, we may not be able to reach agreement on the terms of the business venture with the other investment partners. New joint ventures could cause us to incur additional liabilities or other expenses, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.. The financial condition of our customers may affect their ability to pay amounts owed to us.. Some of our customers may be undercapitalized and cope with cash flow issues. Because of competitive market conditions, we may grant our customers extended payment terms when selling products to them. Subsequent to our fulfilling an order, some customers have been unable to make payments when due, reducing our cash balances and causing us to incur charges to allow for a possibility that some accounts might not be paid. We have had some customers file for bankruptcy. If our customers do not pay their accounts we will incur charges that would reduce our earnings.. We depend on the continuing efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel.  If we lose members of our senior management team or other key personnel, or are unable to successfully recruit and train qualified personnel, our ability to manufacture and sell our products could be harmed.. Our future success depends on the continuing services of members of our senior management team and other key personnel.  Our industry is characterized by high demand and intense competition for talent, and the turnover rate can be high.  We compete for qualified management and other personnel with other specialty material companies and semiconductor companies.  Our employees could leave our company with little or no prior notice and would be free to work for a competitor.  If one or more of our senior executives or other key personnel were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them easily or at all, and other senior management may be required to divert attention from other aspects of the business.  The loss of any of these individuals or our ability to attract or retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.. Our results of operations may suffer if we do not effectively manage our inventory.. We must manage our inventory of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods effectively to meet. 24. Table of Contents. changing customer requirements, while keeping inventory costs down and improving gross margins. Although we seek to maintain sufficient inventory levels of certain materials to guard against interruptions in supply and to meet our near term needs, we may experience shortages of certain key materials. Some of our products and supplies have in the past and may in the future become obsolete while in inventory due to changing customer specifications, or become excess inventory due to decreased demand for our products and an inability to sell the inventory within a foreseeable period. This would result in charges that reduce our gross profit and gross margin. Furthermore, if market prices drop below the prices at which we value inventory, we would need to take a charge for a reduction in inventory values in accordance with the lower of cost or net realizable value valuation rule. We have in the past had to take inventory valuation and impairment charges. Any future unexpected changes in demand or increases in costs of production that cause us to take additional charges for un-saleable, obsolete or excess inventory, or to reduce inventory values, would adversely affect our results of operations.. Financial market volatility and adverse changes in the domestic and global economic environment could have a significant adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.. We are subject to the risks arising from adverse changes and uncertainty in domestic and global economies. Uncertain global economic and political conditions or low or negative growth in China, Europe or the United States, along with volatility in the financial markets, increasing national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions, pose challenges to our industry. Currently China's economy is slowing and this could impact our financial performance. Although we remain well-capitalized, the cost and availability of funds may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets. Turbulence in U.S. and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and profitability. Another severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased volatility in our stock price;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased volatility in foreign currency exchange rates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelays in, or curtailment of, purchasing decisions by our customers or potential customers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased credit risk associated with our customers or potential customers, particularly those that may operate in industries most affected by the economic downturn; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timpairment of our tangible or intangible assets.. In the past we experienced delays in customer purchasing decisions and disruptions in normal volume of customer orders that we believe were in part due to the uncertainties in the global economy and an adverse impact on consumer spending. During challenging and uncertain economic times and in tight credit markets, many customers delay or reduce technology purchases. Should similar events occur again, our business and operating results could be significantly and adversely affected.. Global economic and political conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.. Our operations and financial results depend on worldwide economic and political conditions and their impact on levels of business spending, which had deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions in previous years. Uncertainties in the financial and credit markets may cause our customers to postpone deliveries. Delays in the placement of new orders and extended uncertainties may reduce future sales of our products and services. The revenue growth and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for our substrates, and we are particularly dependent on the market conditions for the wireless, solid - state illumination, fiber optics and telecommunications industries. Because the end users of our products are primarily large companies whose businesses fluctuate with general economic and business conditions, a softening of demand for products that use our substrates, caused by a weakening economy, may result in decreased revenue. Customers may find themselves facing excess inventory from earlier purchases, and may defer or reconsider purchasing products due to the downturn in their business and in the general. 25. Table of Contents. economy. If market conditions deteriorate, we may experience increased collection times and greater write-offs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and our cash flow.. Future tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit may make it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their purchases of capital equipment or of the products we sell. Delays in our customers' ability to obtain such financing, or the unavailability of such financing, would adversely affect our product sales and revenues and therefore harm our business and operating results. We cannot predict the timing, duration of or effect on our business of any future economic downturn or the timing or strength of any subsequent recovery.. The effect of terrorist threats and actions on the general economy could decrease our revenue.. Developed countries such as the United States and China continue to be on alert for terrorist activity. The potential near- and long-term impact terrorist activities may have in regards to our suppliers, customers and markets for our products and the economy is uncertain. There may be embargos of ports or products, or destruction of shipments or our facilities, or attacks that affect our personnel. There may be other potentially adverse effects on our operating results due to significant events that we cannot foresee. Since we perform all of our manufacturing operations in China, terrorist activity or threats against U.S. - owned enterprises are a particular concern to us.. II           Risks Related to International Aspects of Our Business. We derive a significant portion of our revenue from international sales, and our ability to sustain and increase our international sales involves significant risks.. Typically over 85% of our revenue is from international sales. We expect that sales to customers outside the United States, particularly sales to customers in Japan, Taiwan and China, will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue. Therefore, our revenue growth depends significantly on the expansion of our international sales and operations.. All of our manufacturing facilities and most of our suppliers are also located outside the United States. Managing our overseas operations presents challenges, including periodic regional economic downturns, trade balance issues, varying business conditions and demands, political instability, variations in enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in different jurisdictions, differences in the ability to develop relationships with suppliers and other local businesses, changes in U.S. and international laws and regulations, including U.S. export restrictions, fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, the ability to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations, cultural differences and perceptions of U.S. companies, shipping delays and terrorist acts or acts of war, among other risks. Many of these challenges are present in China, which represents a large potential market for semiconductor devices. Global uncertainties with respect to: (i) economic growth rates in various countries; (ii) sustainability of demand for electronics products; (iii) capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers; (iv) price weakness for certain semiconductor devices; (v) changing and tightening environmental regulations and (vi) political instability in regions where we have operations may also affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our dependence on international sales involves a number of risks, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlonger periods to collect accounts receivable;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforeign exchange rate fluctuations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in tariffs, import restrictions, export restrictions, or other trade barriers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in export license requirements;. 26. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical and economic instability; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships.. Most of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, except for sales to our Chinese customers which are denominated in renminbi and our Japanese customers which are denominated in Japanese yen. We also have some small sales denominated in Euro. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar could increase the price of our products in non-U.S. markets and make our products more expensive than competitors' products in these markets.. We are subject to foreign exchange gains and losses that materially impact our income statement.. We are subject to foreign exchange gains and losses that materially impact our income statement.  For example, in 2017 we incurred a loss of $602,000.  In 2016 we incurred a gain of $232,000.. The functional currency of our wholly owned Chinese subsidiary and our partially owned joint venture companies is the Chinese renminbi, the local currency. We incur foreign exchange gains or losses when we pay dollars to one of our China-based companies or a third party supplier in China.  Similarly, if a company in China pays renminbi into one of our bank accounts transacting in dollars the renminbi will be converted to dollars and we can incur a foreign exchange gain or loss.  Hedging renminbi will be considered in the future but it is complicated by the number of companies involved, the diversity of transactions and restrictions imposed by the banking system in China.. Sales to Japanese customers are denominated in Japanese yen.  This subjects us to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen and can result in foreign exchange gains and losses. This has been problematic in the past and, therefore, we instituted a foreign currency hedging program dealing with yen which has mitigated the problem.. The Chinese central government is increasingly aware of air pollution and other forms of environmental pollution and their reform efforts can impact our manufacturing.. The Chinese central government is demonstrating strong leadership to improve air quality and reduce environmental pollution.  These efforts can impact manufacturing companies through increased inspections,  regulatory reforms and work stoppages.  In the fourth quarter of 2017, many manufacturing companies in the greater Beijing area, including AXT, were instructed by the local government to cease most manufacturing for several days until the air quality improved.  Although the work stoppage did not materially impact our quarterly output, shipments or revenue, such work stoppages could reoccur.  If such work stoppages occur in the future, or if the work stoppage period is longer, it could have a material adverse effect on our manufacturing output.  Each of our ten raw material supply chain companies could also be impacted by environmental related orders from the central government.. Joint venture companies in China bring certain risks.. Since our wholly owned subsidiary and all of our partially owned companies reside in China, their activities could subject us to a number of risks associated with conducting operations internationally, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunexpected changes in regulatory requirements that may limit our ability to manufacture, export the products of our joint venture companies, sell into particular jurisdictions or impose multiple conflicting tax laws and regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties in managing geographically disparate operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties in enforcing agreements through non-U.S. legal systems;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical and economic instability, civil unrest or war;. 27. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tterrorist activities that impact international commerce;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws and practices do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws and practices of the United States;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanging laws and policies affecting economic liberalization, foreign investment, currency convertibility or exchange rates, taxation or employment; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnationalization of foreign - owned assets, including intellectual property.. Uncertainty regarding the United States' foreign policy under the new administration could disrupt our business.. We manufacture our substrates in China and, in 2017, approximately 91% of our sales are to customers located outside of the United States.  Further, we have partial ownership of 10 companies in China as part of our supply chain.  The United States' current foreign policy could create uncertainty and caution in the international business community, resulting in possible disruptions in manufacturing, import/export, trade tariffs, sales, investments or other business activity.  Such disruptions could have an adverse impact on our financial performance.. Changes in tariffs, import or export restrictions, Chinese regulations or other trade barriers may reduce gross margins.. We may incur increases in costs due to changes in tariffs, import or export restrictions, other trade barriers, or unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, any of which could reduce our gross margins. For example, in July 2012, we received notice of retroactive value-added taxes (VATs) levied by the tax authorities in China, which applied for the period from July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012.  We expensed the retroactive VATs of approximately $1.3 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2012, which resulted in a decrease in our gross margins. These VATs will continue to negatively impact our gross margins for the future quarters. Given the relatively fluid regulatory environment in China, there could be additional tax or other regulatory changes in the future. Any such changes could directly and materially adversely impact our financial results and general business condition.. If China places restrictions on freight and transportation routes and on port of entry and departure this could result in shipping delays or increased costs for shipping.. In August 2015, there was an explosion at the Port of Tianjin, China.  As a result of this incident the government placed restrictions on importing certain materials and on freight routes used to transport these materials.  We experienced some modest disruption from these restrictions.  If the government were to place additional restrictions on the transportation of materials, then our ability to transport our raw materials or products could be limited and result in manufacturing delays or bottlenecks at shipping ports, affecting our ability to deliver products to our customers. During periods of such restrictions, we may increase our stock of critical materials (such as arsenic, gallium, and other chemicals) for use during the period that these restrictions are likely to last, which will increase our use of cash and increase our inventory level. Any of these restrictions could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition.. Our operating results depend in large part on continued customer acceptance of our substrate products manufactured in China and continued improvements in product quality.. We manufacture all of our products in China, and source most of our raw materials in China. We have in the past experienced quality problems with our China - manufactured products. Our previous quality problems caused us to lose market share to our competitors, as some of our customers reduced their orders from us until our wafer surface quality was as good and as consistent as that offered by our competitors and instead allocated their requirements for compound semiconductor substrates to our competitors. If we are unable to continue to achieve customer qualifications for our products, or if we are unable to control product quality, customers may not increase purchases of our products, our China facility will become underutilized, and we will be unable to achieve revenue growth.. 28. Table of Contents. Changes in China's political, social, regulatory or economic environments may affect our financial performance.. Our financial performance may be affected by changes in China's political, social, regulatory or economic environments. The role of the Chinese central and local governments in the Chinese economy is significant. Chinese policies toward hazardous materials, including arsenic, environmental controls, air pollution, economic liberalization, laws and policies affecting technology companies, foreign investment, currency exchange rates, taxation structure and other matters could change, resulting in greater restrictions on our ability to do business and operate our manufacturing facilities in China. We have observed a growing fluidity and tightening of regulations concerning hazardous materials and other environmental controls.  The Chinese government could revoke, terminate or suspend our operating licenses for reasons related to environmental control over the use of hazardous materials, air pollution, labor complaints, national security and similar reasons without compensation to us. In days of severe air pollution the government has ordered manufacturing companies to stop all production.  For example, in Q4 of 2017 many manufacturing companies in the greater Beijing area, including AXT, were instructed to cease most manufacturing for several days until the air quality improved. If the Chinese government were to take any of these actions, we would be prevented from conducting all or part of our business. Any failure on our part to comply with governmental regulations could result in the loss of our ability to manufacture our products.  Further, any imposition of surcharges or any increase in Chinese tax rates or reduction or elimination of Chinese tax benefits could hurt our operating results.. The Beijing city government is expanding its offices into the area where our manufacturing facility is currently located and is in the process of moving thousands of government employees into this area.  The Beijing city government desires to upgrade this area and has applied pressure on manufacturing companies to relocate, including us.  We are cooperating with the government and, in accordance with our relocation plan, are relocating our gallium arsenide wafer production line to the city of Dingxing which is about 90 minutes south of our current facility.  In addition, we have acquired a site in Kazuo, located in the province of Liaoning near the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and under the jurisdiction of the prefecture-level city of Chaoyang, which will initially be used for the synthesis of raw gallium and raw arsenic. We also intend to use the Kazuo site for ingot growth. Additional environmental permits, regulatory approvals and zoning conformance applications are in process for both sites.  In light of the increased focus in China on the use of hazardous materials and environmental issues there can be no assurance that these matters will be completed smoothly or at all.. The relocation of our gallium arsenide production line requires us to accurately execute our relocation plan.  We expect that our major customers will want to examine and qualify the wafer substrates produced at the new site before placing volume purchase orders for products produced at the new site.  A failure to properly execute our relocation plan could result in disruption to our production and have a material adverse impact on our revenue and our results of operations and financial condition.. Our international operations are exposed to potential adverse tax consequence in China.. Our international operations create a risk of potential adverse tax consequences.  Taxes on income in our China-based companies are dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm's length basis. Due to inconsistencies among taxing authorities in application of the arm's length standard, transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could, if successful, materially increase our consolidated income tax expense. We are subject to tax audits in China and an audit could result in the assessment of additional income tax against us.  This could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made and could result in increases to our overall tax expense in subsequent periods.  Various taxing agencies in China are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue. In addition to risks regarding income tax we have in the past been retroactively assessed value added taxes (\"VAT\" or sales tax) and such VAT assessments could occur again in the future.. If there are power shortages in China, we may have to temporarily close our China operations, which would adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and meet customer orders, and would result in reduced revenue.. In the past, China has faced power shortages resulting in power demand outstripping supply in peak periods.. 29. Table of Contents. Instability in electrical supply has caused sporadic outages among residential and commercial consumers causing the Chinese government to implement tough measures to ease the energy shortage. If further problems with power shortages occur in the future, we may be required to make temporary closures of our operations or of our subsidiary and joint venture operations. We may be unable to manufacture our products and would then be unable to meet customer orders except from finished goods inventory on hand. As a result, our revenue could be adversely impacted, and our relationships with our customers could suffer, impacting our ability to generate future revenue. In addition, if power is shut off at any of our facilities at any time, either voluntarily or as a result of unplanned brownouts, during certain phases of our manufacturing process including our crystal growth phase, the work in process may be ruined and rendered unusable, causing us to incur costs that will not be covered by revenue, and negatively impacting our cost of revenue and gross margins.. An outbreak of a contagious disease such as Ebola, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or the Avian Flu may adversely impact our manufacturing operations and some of our key suppliers and customers.. Any reoccurrence of SARS or an outbreak of a contagious disease, such as Avian Flu or Ebola, may cause us to temporarily close our manufacturing operations. Similarly, if one or more of our key suppliers is required to close for an extended period, we might not have enough raw material inventories to continue manufacturing operations. In addition, while we possess management skills among our China staff that enable us to maintain our manufacturing operations with minimal on-site supervision from our U.S. - based staff, our business could also be harmed if travel to or from China and the United States is restricted or inadvisable. If our manufacturing operations were closed for a significant period, we could lose revenue and market share, which would depress our financial performance and could be difficult to recapture. Finally, if one of our key customers is required to close for an extended period, we might not be able to ship product to them, our revenue would decline and our financial performance would suffer.. III         Risks Related to Our Financial Results and Capital Structure. We may utilize our cash balances for relocation, expansion, or to offset a business downturn resulting in the decline of our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, and if we need additional capital, those funds may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.. Our liquidity is affected by many factors including, among others, the relocation of our gallium arsenide manufacturing operations, the extent to which we pursue on-going capital expenditures, the acquisition and build out of the sites at Dingxing and Kazuo, the level of our production, the level of profits or losses, and other factors related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economies. Our relocation expenditures and any negative cash flow effects of these other factors will draw down our cash reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition, reduce our value and possibly impinge our ability to raise debt and equity funding in the future, at a time when we might need to raise additional cash or elect to raise additional cash. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that events will not require us to seek additional capital or, if required, that such capital would be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.. Unpredictable fluctuations in our operating results could disappoint analysts or our investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant fluctuations in our revenue, gross margins and earnings. Our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to develop, manufacture and deliver high quality products in a timely and cost-effective manner;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisruptions during the relocation of our gallium arsenide product line;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisruptions in manufacturing if air pollution or another environmental hazard causes the government to order work stoppages..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuation of our manufacturing yields;. 30. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdecreases in the prices of our or our competitors' products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in demand for our products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe volume and timing of orders from our customers, and cancellations, push-outs and delays of customer orders once booked;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdecline in general economic conditions or downturns in the industry in which we compete;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpansion of our manufacturing capacity;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpansion of our operations in China;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimited availability and increased cost of raw materials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcosts incurred in connection with any future acquisitions of businesses or technologies; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreases in our expenses, including expenses for research and development.. Due to these factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful indicators of our future performance.. A substantial percentage of our operating expenses are fixed, and we may be unable to adjust spending to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenue. As a result, any delay in generating revenue could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of market analysts or investors, which could also cause our stock price to decline.. If our operating results and financial performance do not meet the guidance that we have provided to the public, our stock price may decline.. We provide public guidance on our expected operating and financial results.  Although we believe that this guidance provides our stockholders, investors and analysts with a better understanding of our expectations for the future, such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements.  Our actual results may not meet the guidance we have provided.  If our operating or financial results do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts, our stock price may decline.. We have adopted certain anti-takeover measures that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.. Our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 800,000 shares of preferred stock in addition to the outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of shares of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. We have no present intention to issue additional shares of preferred stock.. Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger, acquisition or change of control, or changes in our management, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The following are some examples of these provisions:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe division of our board of directors into three separate classes, each with three-year terms;. 31. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe right of our board to elect a director to fill a space created by a board vacancy or the expansion of the board;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability of our board to alter our amended and restated bylaws; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe requirement that only our board or the holders of at least 10% of our outstanding shares may call a special meeting of our stockholders.. Furthermore, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder (a stockholder who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock) for a period of three years following the time that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t662/3% of the shares of voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder approve the merger or combination, or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe board of directors approves the merger or combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder.. Our common stock may be delisted from The Nasdaq Global Select Market, which could negatively impact the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets.. Our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. The bid price of our common stock has in the past closed below the $1.00 minimum per share bid price required for continued inclusion on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under Marketplace Rule 5450(a). If the bid price of our common stock remains below $1.00 per share for thirty consecutive business days, we could be subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Global Select Market.. Any delisting from The Nasdaq Global Select Market could have an adverse effect on our business and on the trading of our common stock. If a delisting of our common stock were to occur, our common stock would trade in the over-the-counter market and be quoted on a service such as those provided by OTC Markets Group, Inc. Such alternatives are generally considered to be less efficient markets, and our stock price, as well as the liquidity of our common stock, may be adversely impacted as a result. Delisting from The Nasdaq Global Select Market could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by customers, suppliers and employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities, as well as the loss of liquidity for our stockholders.. Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.. As of December 31, 2017, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $63.6 million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $0.3 million, which begin expiring in varying amounts from 2022 if unused. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change,\" the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited.  In general, an \"ownership change\" occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \"5% shareholders\" that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.  Similar rules may apply under state tax laws.  We might have undergone prior ownership changes, and we may undergo ownership changes in the future, which may result in limitations on our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes.  Any such limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.. 32. Table of Contents. IV.         Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property. Intellectual property infringement claims may be costly to resolve and could divert management attention.. Other companies may hold or obtain patents on inventions or may otherwise claim proprietary rights to technology necessary to our business. The markets in which we compete are comprised of competitors that in some cases hold substantial patent portfolios covering aspects of products that could be similar to ours. We could become subject to claims that we are infringing patent, trademark, copyright or other proprietary rights of others. We have in the past been involved in lawsuits alleging patent infringement, and could in the future be involved in similar litigation. For example, we entered into a settlement agreement with Sumitomo in 2011 to settle its claim of patent infringement, which resulted in AXT paying them royalties.. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, including our non-patented proprietary process technology, we may lose valuable assets or incur costly litigation.. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and trade secret laws, non-disclosure agreements and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our proprietary technology. We believe that our internal, non-patented proprietary process technology methods, systems and processes are a valuable and critical element of our intellectual property. We must establish and maintain safeguards to avoid the theft of these processes. Our ability to establish and maintain a position of technology leadership also depends on the skills of our development personnel.  Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties can develop products or processes similar to ours. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate, and our competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products or design around our patents. We believe that at least two of our competitors ship GaAs substrates produced using a process similar to our VGF process. Our competitors may also develop and patent improvements to the VGF technology upon which we rely, and thus may limit any exclusivity we enjoy by virtue of our patents or trade secrets.. It is possible that pending or future United States or foreign patent applications made by us will not be approved, that our issued patents will not protect our intellectual property, or that third parties will challenge our ownership rights or the validity of our patents. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States and it may be more difficult to monitor the use of our intellectual property. Our competitors may be able to legitimately ascertain non-patented proprietary technology embedded in our systems. If this occurs, we may not be able to prevent the development of technology substantially similar to ours.. We may have to resort to costly litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability. Enforcing or defending our proprietary technology is expensive, could cause us to divert resources and may not prove successful. Our protective measures may prove inadequate to protect our proprietary rights, and if we fail to enforce or protect our rights, we could lose valuable assets.. V           Risks Related to Compliance, Environmental Regulations and Other Legal Matters. If we fail to comply with environmental and safety regulations, we may be subject to significant fines or forced to cease our operations;. We are subject to federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations in all of our operating locations, including laws and regulations of China, such as laws and regulations related to the development, manufacture and use of our products, the use of hazardous materials, the operation of our facilities, and the use of our real property. These laws and regulations govern the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials during manufacturing, research and development, and sales demonstrations. If we fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could be subject to substantial liability for clean-up efforts, personal injury, fines or suspension or be forced to cease our operations, and/or suspend or terminate the development, manufacture or use of certain of our products, the use of our facilities, or the use of our real property, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. 33.

These efforts can impact manufacturing companies through increased inspections, regulatory reforms and work stoppages.  In the fourth quarter of 2017, many manufacturing companies in the greater Beijing area, including AXT, were instructed by the local government to cease most manufacturing for several days until the air quality improved.  Although the work stoppage did not materially impact our quarterly output, shipments or revenue, such work stoppages could reoccur.  If such work stoppages occur in the future, or if the work stoppage period is longer, it could have a material adverse effect on our manufacturing output.  Each of our 10 raw material supply chain companies could also be impacted by environmental-related orders from the central government.. In addition, from time to time, the Chinese government issues new regulations, which may require additional actions on our part to comply.  On February 27, 2015, the China State Administration of Work Safety updated its list of hazardous substances.  The previous list, which was published in 2002, did not restrict the materials that we use in our wafers.  The new list added gallium arsenide.  As a result of the newly published list, we were instructed to obtain a permit to continue to manufacture our gallium arsenide substrate wafers.  The Beijing municipal authority accepted our permit application in May 2015, but has not yet issued to us the requisite permit while we continue to show good faith and, more recently, significant progress in relocating our gallium arsenide production.  If our application is denied in the future before we complete our relocation, then our gallium arsenide production could be disrupted, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition.. We could be subject to suits for personal injuries caused by hazardous materials.. In 2005, a complaint was filed against us alleging personal injury, general negligence, intentional tort, wage loss and other damages, including punitive damages, as a result of exposure of plaintiffs to high levels of gallium arsenide in gallium arsenide wafers, and methanol. Other current and/or former employees could bring litigation against us in the future. Although we have in place engineering, administrative and personnel protective equipment programs to address these issues, our ability to expand or continue to operate our present locations could be restricted or we could be required to acquire costly remediation equipment or incur other significant expenses if we were found liable for failure to comply with environmental and safety regulations. Existing or future changes in laws or regulations in the United States and China may require us to incur significant expenditures or liabilities, or may restrict our operations. In addition, our employees could be exposed to chemicals or other hazardous materials at our facilities and we may be subject to lawsuits seeking damages for wrongful death or personal injuries allegedly caused by exposure to chemicals or hazardous materials at our facilities.. Litigation is inherently uncertain and while we would expect to defend ourselves vigorously, it is possible that our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period by litigation pending and any additional litigation brought against us. In addition, future litigation could divert management's attention from our business and operations, causing our business and financial results to suffer. We could incur defense or settlement costs in excess of the insurance covering these litigation matters, or that could result in significant judgments against us or cause us to incur costly settlements, in excess of our insurance limits.. We are subject to internal control evaluations and attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act.. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act of 2002, we must include in our Annual Report on Form 10-K a report of management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Ongoing compliance with this requirement is complex, costly and time-consuming. If: (1) we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting; or (2) our management does not timely assess the adequacy of such internal control, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and the public's perception of us may be adversely impacted.. We need to continue to improve or implement our systems, procedures and controls.. We rely on certain manual processes for data collection and information processing, as do our joint venture companies. If we fail to manage these procedures properly or fail to effectively manage a transition from manual processes to automated processes, our systems and controls may be disrupted. To manage our business effectively, we may need to implement additional management information systems, further develop our operating, administrative,. 34.
