[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. The following risk factors and all other information contained in this report should be considered carefully when evaluating us. These risk factors could affect our actual results. Other risks and uncertainties, in addition to those that are. 29. Table of Contents. described below, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows (including our ability to make distributions to our noteholders) could be affected materially and adversely. In that case, we may be unable to make distributions to our unitholders and the trading price of our common units could decline. In this report, the terms \"Company\" or \"Registrant,\" as well as the terms \"ENLC,\" \"our,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or like terms, are sometimes used to refer to EnLink Midstream, LLC itself or EnLink Midstream, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries, including ENLK and its consolidated subsidiaries.  Readers are advised to refer to the context in which terms are used, and to read these risk factors in conjunction with other detailed information concerning our business as set forth in our accompanying financial statements and notes and contained in \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" included herein.. Risks Inherent in an Investment in ENLC. Devon owns approximately 63.8% of ENLC's outstanding common units as of February 14, 2018 and controls the Managing Member, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. Our Managing Member and its affiliates, including Devon, have conflicts of interest with us and limited duties to us and may favor their own interests to your detriment.. Devon owns and controls the Managing Member and appoints all of the directors of the Managing Member, subject to, in certain circumstances, the approval of a majority of our independent directors and our Chief Executive Officer. Some of the directors of the Managing Member are also directors or officers of Devon. Although the Managing Member has a duty to manage us in a manner it subjectively believes to be in, or not opposed to, our best interests, the directors and officers of the Managing Member also have a duty to manage the Managing Member in a manner that is in the best interests of Devon, in its capacity as the sole member of the Managing Member. Conflicts of interest may arise between Devon and its affiliates, including the Managing Member, on the one hand, and us and our unitholders, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts of interest, the Managing Member may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our unitholders. These conflicts include, among others, the following situations:. • neither our operating agreement nor any other agreement requires Devon to pursue a business strategy that favors us, to enter into any commercial agreements with us or ENLK, or to sell any assets to us or ENLK. Devon's directors and officers have a fiduciary duty to make decisions in the best interests of the owners of Devon, which may be contrary to our interests;. • Devon may be constrained by the terms of its debt instruments from taking actions, or refraining from taking actions, that may be in our best interests;. • Devon, as a major customer of ours, has an economic incentive to cause us to not seek higher transportation rates and processing fees, even if such higher rates or fees would reflect rates and fees that could be obtained in arm's-length, third-party transactions;. • the Managing Member determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, borrowings, issuance of additional membership interests and reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is available to be distributed to unitholders;. • the Managing Member determines which costs incurred by it are reimbursable by us;. • the Managing Member is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us in exercising certain rights under our operating agreement;. • our operating agreement limits the liability of, and eliminates and replaces the fiduciary duties that would otherwise be owed by, the Managing Member and also restricts the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that, without the provisions of the operating agreement, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty;. • any future contracts between us, on the one hand, and the Managing Member and its affiliates, on the other, will not be the result of arm's-length negotiations;. • except in limited circumstances, the Managing Member has the power and authority to conduct our business without unitholder approval;. 30. Table of Contents. • disputes may arise under commercial agreements between Devon and us or our subsidiaries, including ENLK;. • the Managing Member may exercise its right to call and purchase all of ENLC's outstanding common units not owned by it and its affiliates if it and its affiliates own more than 90% of ENLC's outstanding common units;. • the Managing Member controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by the Managing Member and its affiliates, including commercial agreements; and. • the Managing Member decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us.. Devon may compete with us.. Devon may compete with us, including by developing or acquiring additional gathering and processing assets. Pursuant to the terms of our operating agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, does not apply to the Managing Member or any of its affiliates, including Devon and its executive officers and directors. Any such person or entity that becomes aware of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for us will not have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to us. Any such person or entity will not be liable to us or to any of our members for breach of any fiduciary duty or other duty by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to another person or entity or does not communicate such opportunity or information to us. This may create actual and potential conflicts of interest between us and affiliates of the Managing Member and result in less than favorable treatment of us and our unitholders.. Cost reimbursements due to the Managing Member and its affiliates for services provided, which will be determined by the Managing Member, could be substantial and would reduce cash available for distribution to our unitholders.. Prior to making distributions on ENLC common units, we will reimburse the Managing Member and its affiliates for all expenses they incur on our behalf. These expenses will include all costs incurred by the Managing Member and its affiliates in managing and operating us, including costs for rendering corporate staff and support services to us, if any. There is no limit on the amount of expenses for which the Managing Member and its affiliates may be reimbursed. Our operating agreement provides that the Managing Member will determine the expenses that are allocable to us. In addition, to the extent the Managing Member incurs obligations on behalf of us, we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify the Managing Member. If we are unable or unwilling to reimburse or indemnify the Managing Member, the Managing Member may take actions to cause us to make payments of these obligations and liabilities. Any such payments could reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders.. Our operating agreement replaces the fiduciary duties otherwise owed to our unitholders by the Managing Member with contractual standards governing its duties.. Our operating agreement contains provisions that eliminate and replace the fiduciary standards that the Managing Member would otherwise be held to by state fiduciary duty law. For example, our operating agreement permits the Managing Member to make a number of decisions, in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as the Managing Member, or otherwise, free of fiduciary duties to us and our unitholders. This entitles the Managing Member to consider only the interests and factors that it desires, and it has no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or our members. Examples of decisions that the Managing Member may make in its individual capacity include:. • how to allocate business opportunities among us and its other affiliates;. • whether to exercise its call right;. • how to exercise its voting rights with respect to any membership interests it owns;. • whether or not to consent to any merger or consolidation of us or any amendment to our operating agreement; and. • whether or not to seek the approval of the conflicts committee or the unitholders, or neither, of any conflicted transaction.. By purchasing any ENLC common units, a unitholder is treated as having consented to the provisions in our operating agreement, including the provisions discussed above.. 31. Table of Contents. Our operating agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of our membership interests for actions taken by the Managing Member that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.. Our operating agreement contains provisions that restrict the remedies available to holders of ENLC common units for actions taken by the Managing Member that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty under state fiduciary duty law. For example, our operating agreement provides that:. • whenever the Managing Member makes a determination or takes, or declines to take, any other action in its capacity as the Managing Member, the Managing Member is required to make such determination, or take or decline to take such other action, in good faith, and will not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by Delaware law, or any other law, rule or regulation, or at equity;. • the Managing Member will not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as a managing member so long as it acted in good faith, meaning that it subjectively believed that the decision was in, or not opposed to, our best interests;. • our operating agreement is governed by Delaware law and any claims, suits, actions or proceedings:. • arising out of or relating in any way to our operating agreement (including any claims, suits or actions to interpret, apply or enforce the provisions of our operating agreement or the duties, obligations or liabilities among members or of members to us, or the rights or powers of, or restrictions on, the members or the company);. • brought in a derivative manner on our behalf;. • asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees or the Managing Member, or owed by the Managing Member, to us or our members;. • asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DLLCA; or. • asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine;. • must be exclusively brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, any other court located in the State of Delaware with subject matter jurisdiction), regardless of whether such claims, suits, actions or proceedings sound in contract, tort, fraud or otherwise, are based on common law, statutory, equitable, legal or other grounds, or are derivative or direct claims. By purchasing ENLC common units, a member is irrevocably consenting to these limitations and provisions regarding claims, suits, actions or proceedings and submitting to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or such other Delaware courts) in connection with any such claims, suits, actions or proceedings;. • the Managing Member and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us or our members resulting from any act or omission unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the Managing Member or its officers or directors, as the case may be, acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct, or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the conduct was unlawful; and. • the Managing Member will not be in breach of its obligations under our operating agreement or its duties to us or our members if a transaction with an affiliate or the resolution of a conflict of interest is:. • approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of the Managing Member, although the Managing Member is not obligated to seek such approval; or. • approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding ENLC common units, excluding any ENLC common units owned by the Managing Member and its affiliates, although the Managing Member is not obligated to seek such approval.. 32. Table of Contents. Our Managing Member will not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions whether or not to seek the approval of the conflicts committee of the board of directors of the Managing Member or holders of a majority of ENLC common units, excluding any ENLC common units owned by the Managing Member and its affiliates. If an affiliate transaction or the resolution of a conflict of interest is not approved by the conflicts committee or holders of ENLC common units then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, taking any action or failing to act, the board of directors acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any member or us, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption.. Holders of ENLC common units will have limited voting rights and will not be entitled to elect the Managing Member or the board of directors of the Managing Member, which could reduce the price at which ENLC common units will trade.. Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, ENLC unitholders will have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management's decisions regarding our business. Unitholders do not have the right to elect the Managing Member or the board of directors of the Managing Member on an annual or other continuing basis. The board of directors of the Managing Member, including its independent directors, is chosen by the sole member of the Managing Member, subject, in certain circumstances, to the approval of a majority of our independent directors and our Chief Executive Officer. Furthermore, if unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of the Managing Member, they will have very limited ability to remove the Managing Member. Our operating agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders' ability to influence the manner or direction of management. As a result of these limitations, the price at which ENLC common units trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price.. Even if our unitholders are dissatisfied, they cannot initially remove the Managing Member without its consent.. ENLC's unitholders are unable to remove the Managing Member without its consent because the Managing Member and its affiliates own sufficient units to be able to prevent its removal. The vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of all outstanding ENLC common units voting together as a single class is required to remove the Managing Member. As of February 14, 2018, the Managing Member and its affiliates owned approximately 63.8% of the outstanding ENLC common units.. Our operating agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20% or more of ENLC's common units.. Unitholders' voting rights are further restricted by our operating agreement, which provides that any units held by a person that owns 20% or more of any class of units, other than the Managing Member, its affiliates, their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of the Managing Member, cannot vote on any matter.. Control of the Managing Member may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.. Our Managing Member may transfer its managing member interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Furthermore, our operating agreement does not restrict the ability of Devon to transfer all or a portion of the ownership interest in the Managing Member to a third party. If the managing member interest were transferred, the new owner of the Managing Member would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of the Managing Member with its own choices and thereby exert significant control over the decisions made by such board of directors and officers. This effectively permits a \"change of control\" of the Managing Member without the vote or consent of the unitholders.. We may issue additional units, including units that are senior to ENLC common units, without your approval, which would dilute your existing ownership interests.. Our operating agreement does not limit the number of additional membership interests that we may issue at any time without the approval of our unitholders. The issuance by us of additional ENLC common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:. • each unitholder's proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;. • the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease;. • the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and. • the market price of ENLC common units may decline.. 33. Table of Contents. Devon may sell ENLC common units in the public markets or otherwise, which sales could have an adverse impact on the trading price of our common units.. As of February 14, 2018, Devon held 115,495,669 ENLC common units. Additionally, we have agreed to provide Devon with certain registration rights with respect to the ENLC common units held by it. The sale of these units could have an adverse impact on the price of ENLC common units or on any trading market that may develop.. Our Managing Member has a call right that may require unitholders to sell their ENLC common units at an undesirable time or price.. If at any time the Managing Member and its affiliates own more than 90% of ENLC's common units, the Managing Member will have the right, but not the obligation, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, to acquire all, but not less than all, of ENLC common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price equal to the greater of (1) the average of the daily closing price of ENLC common units over the 20 trading days preceding the date three days before notice of exercise of the call right is first mailed and (2) the highest per-unit price paid by the Managing Member or any of its affiliates for ENLC common units during the 90-day period preceding the date such notice is first mailed. As a result, unitholders may be required to sell their ENLC common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return or a negative return on their investment. Unitholders may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their units. Our Managing Member is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the value of ENLC common units to be repurchased by it upon exercise of the call right. There is no restriction in our operating agreement that prevents the Managing Member from issuing additional ENLC common units and exercising its call right. If the Managing Member exercised its call right, the effect would be to take us private. As of February 14, 2018, Devon owned an aggregate of approximately 63.8% of outstanding ENLC common units.. Unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them.. Under certain circumstances, unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under the DLLCA, a limited liability company may not make a distribution to a member if, after the distribution, all liabilities of the limited liability company, other than liabilities to members on account of their membership interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specific property of the company, would exceed the fair value of the assets of the limited liability company. For the purpose of determining the fair value of the assets of a limited liability company, the DLLCA provides that the fair value of property subject to liability for which recourse of creditors is limited shall be included in the assets of the limited liability company only to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds the non-recourse liability. The DLLCA provides that a member who receives a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution was in violation of the DLLCA will be liable to the limited liability company for the amount of the distribution for three years.. The price of ENLC common units may fluctuate significantly, which could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.. As of February 14, 2018, only approximately 36.2% of ENLC common units were held by public unitholders. The lack of liquidity may result in wide bid-ask spreads, contribute to significant fluctuations in the market price of ENLC common units and limit the number of investors who are able to buy ENLC common units. The market price of ENLC common units may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:. • the quarterly distributions paid by us with respect to ENLC common units;. • our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;. • the loss of Devon as a customer;. • events affecting Devon;. • announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions;. • changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;. • general economic conditions;. • the failure of securities analysts to cover ENLC common units or changes in financial estimates by analysts;. • future sales of ENLC common units; and. • other factors described in these \"Risk Factors.\". 34. Table of Contents. We are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of NYSE rules and, as a result, we qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from some of the listing requirements with respect to independent directors.. Because Devon controls more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors of the Managing Member, we are a controlled company within the meaning of NYSE rules, which exempt controlled companies from the following corporate governance requirements:. • the requirement that a majority of the board consist of independent directors;. • the requirement that the board of directors have a nominating or corporate governance committee, composed entirely of independent directors, that is responsible for identifying individuals qualified to become board members, consistent with criteria approved by the board, selection of board nominees for the next annual meeting of equity holders, development of corporate governance guidelines and oversight of the evaluation of the board and management;. • the requirement that we have a compensation committee of the board, composed entirely of independent directors, that is responsible for reviewing and approving corporate goals and objectives relevant to chief executive officer compensation, evaluation of the chief executive officer's performance in light of the goals and objectives, determination and approval of the chief executive officer's compensation, making recommendations to the board with respect to compensation of other executive officers and incentive compensation and equity-based plans that are subject to board approval and producing a report on executive compensation to be included in an annual proxy statement or Form 10-K filed with the SEC;. • the requirement that we conduct an annual performance evaluation of the nominating, corporate governance and compensation committees; and. • the requirement that we have written charters for the nominating, corporate governance and compensation committees addressing the committees' responsibilities and annual performance evaluations.. For so long as we remain a controlled company, we will not be required to have a majority of independent directors or nominating, corporate governance or compensation committees. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.. Our cash flow consists almost exclusively of distributions from ENLK.. Currently, our only cash-generating assets are our partnership interests in ENLK and our 16.1% limited partner interest in EnLink Oklahoma T.O. Although EnLink Oklahoma T.O. generates positive cash flows from operating activities, our capital contributions exceeded distributions received during 2017, and estimated capital contributions during 2018 will exceed its cash flows from operating activities. We have a $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the \"ENLC Credit Facility\") in place to fund our share of capital expenditures to the extent not funded by EnLink Oklahoma T.O.'s operating cash flows. See \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6\" for further discussion. If our borrowing capacity under the ENLC Credit Facility is not sufficient to fund our share of EnLink Oklahoma T.O.'s capital expenditures, we may have to use our cash flow from ENLK distributions to fund such costs. Our cash flow is therefore completely dependent upon the ability of ENLK to make distributions to its partners.. The amount of cash that ENLK can distribute to its partners, including us, each quarter principally depends upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:. • the amount of natural gas transported in its gathering and transmission pipelines;. • the level of ENLK's processing operations;. • the fees ENLK charges and the margins it realizes for its services;. • the prices of, levels of production of and demand for crude oil, condensate, NGLs and natural gas;. • the volume of natural gas ENLK gathers, compresses, processes, transports and sells, the volume of NGLs ENLK processes or fractionates and sells, the volume of crude oil ENLK handles at its crude terminals, the volume of crude oil and condensate ENLK gathers, transports, purchases and sells, the volumes of condensate stabilized and the volumes of brine ENLK disposes;. • the relationship between natural gas and NGL prices; and. • ENLK's level of operating costs.. 35. Table of Contents. In addition, the actual amount of cash ENLK will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, some of which are beyond its control, including:. • the level of capital expenditures ENLK makes;. • the cost of acquisitions, if any;. • ENLK's debt service requirements;. • fluctuations in its working capital needs;. • ENLK's ability to make working capital borrowings under its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility (the \"ENLK Credit Facility\") to pay distributions;. • prevailing economic conditions; and. • the amount of cash reserves established by the General Partner in its sole discretion for the proper conduct of business.. Because of these factors, we and ENLK may not be able, or may not have sufficient available cash to pay distributions to unitholders each quarter. Furthermore, you should also be aware that the amount of cash ENLK has available for distribution depends primarily upon its cash flows, including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings, and is not solely a function of profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, ENLK may make cash distributions during periods when it records losses and may not make cash distributions during periods when it records net income.. Although we control ENLK, the General Partner owes fiduciary duties to ENLK and its unitholders.. Conflicts of interest exist and may arise in the future as a result of the relationship between us and our affiliates, including the General Partner, on the one hand, and ENLK and its limited partners, on the other hand. The directors and officers of EnLink Midstream GP, LLC have fiduciary duties to manage the General Partner in a manner beneficial to us, its owner. At the same time, the General Partner has a fiduciary duty to manage ENLK in a manner beneficial to ENLK and its limited partners. The board of directors of EnLink Midstream GP, LLC will resolve any such conflict and has broad latitude to consider the interests of all parties to the conflict. The resolution of these conflicts may not always be in our best interest or that of our unitholders.. For example, conflicts of interest may arise in the following situations:. • the allocation of shared overhead expenses to ENLK and us;. • the interpretation and enforcement of contractual obligations between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and ENLK, on the other hand;. • the determination of the amount of cash to be distributed to ENLK's partners and the amount of cash to be reserved for the future conduct of ENLK's business;. • the determination whether to make borrowings under the ENLK Credit Facility to pay distributions to partners; and. • any decision we make in the future to engage in activities in competition with ENLK.. If the General Partner is not fully reimbursed or indemnified for obligations and liabilities it incurs in managing the business and affairs of ENLK, its value, and therefore the value of ENLC common units, could decline.. The General Partner may make expenditures on behalf of ENLK for which it will seek reimbursement from ENLK. In addition, under Delaware law, the General Partner, in its capacity as the General Partner of ENLK, has unlimited liability for the obligations of ENLK, such as its debts and environmental liabilities, except for those contractual obligations of ENLK that are expressly made without recourse to the General Partner. To the extent the General Partner incurs obligations on behalf of ENLK, it is entitled to be reimbursed or indemnified by ENLK. In the event that ENLK is unable or unwilling to reimburse or indemnify the General Partner, the General Partner may be unable to satisfy these liabilities or obligations, which would reduce its value and therefore the value of ENLC common units.. If in the future we cease to manage and control ENLK, we may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.. If we cease to manage and control ENLK and are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, we would either have to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, obtain exemptive relief from the SEC or modify our organizational structure or our contractual rights so as to fall outside the definition of an investment company. Registering as an investment company could, among other things, materially limit our ability to engage in transactions with affiliates, including the purchase and sale of certain securities or other property to or from our. 36. Table of Contents. affiliates, restrict our ability to borrow funds or engage in other transactions involving leverage and require us to add additional directors who are independent of us and our affiliates, and adversely affect the price of ENLC common units.. We are treated as a corporation subject to entity level federal and state income taxation. Any such entity level income taxes will reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to you.. We are treated as a corporation for tax purposes that is required to pay federal and state income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates. Historically, we have had net operating losses that eliminated substantially all of our taxable income and, thus, we historically have not had to pay material amounts of income taxes. We anticipate generating net operating losses for tax purposes during 2018, and as a result, do not expect to incur material amounts of federal and state income tax liabilities. In the event we do generate taxable income, federal and state income tax liabilities will reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders.. On December 22, 2017, tax legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\") was enacted. Among other things, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (i) reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% (beginning in 2018), (ii) generally will limit our annual deductions for interest expense to no more than 30% of our \"adjusted taxable income\" (plus 100% of our business interest income) for the year and (iii) will permit us to offset only 80% (rather than 100%) of our taxable income with any net operating losses (NOLs) we generate after 2017. Currently we do not expect the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, taken as a whole, to have any material adverse impact on our cash tax liabilities, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, it is possible in the future that the NOL and/or interest deductibility limitations could have the effect of causing us to incur income tax liability sooner than we otherwise would have incurred such liability or, in certain cases, could cause us to incur income tax liability that we might otherwise not have incurred, in the absence of these tax law changes.. The terms of the ENLC Credit Facility may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in business or to take certain actions.. Our credit agreement contains, and any future indebtedness we incur will likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best long-term interest. In addition, the ENLC Credit Facility requires us to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios and tests.. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the ENLC Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of such an event of default, all amounts outstanding under the ENLC Credit Facility could be declared to be immediately due and payable and all applicable commitments to extend further credit could be terminated. If we are unable to repay the accelerated debt under the ENLC Credit Facility, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged our ENLK common units and the 100% membership interest in the General Partner that are indirectly held by us and our 100% equity interest in each of our wholly-owned subsidiaries as collateral under the ENLC Credit Facility. If indebtedness under the ENLC Credit Facility is accelerated, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay the indebtedness. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the ENLC Credit Facility and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities.. Certain events of default under the ENLK Credit Facility, the occurrence of certain bankruptcy events affecting ENLK or our failure to continue to control ENLK could constitute an event of default under our credit facility.. Under the terms of the ENLC Credit Facility, certain events of default under the ENLK Credit Facility could constitute an event of default under the ENLC Credit Facility. Additionally, certain events of default under the ENLC Credit Facility relate specifically to events relating to ENLK, including certain bankruptcy events affecting ENLK or any event that causes us to no longer indirectly control ENLK. Additionally, any default by ENLK under the terms of the ENLK Credit Facility could limit its ability to make distributions to us.. 37. Table of Contents. Risks Inherent in our Business. We are dependent on Devon for a substantial portion of the natural gas that we gather, process and transport. The expiration of five-year MVCs from Devon in 2019 and 2020 could result in a material decline in our operating results and cash available for distribution because the volumes of natural gas that we gathered, processed and transported for Devon during 2017 have been below the MVC levels under certain of our contracts.. We are dependent on Devon for a substantial portion of our natural gas supply. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Devon represented approximately 46.8% of our gross operating margin. In order to minimize volumetric exposure, in March 2014, we obtained five-year MVCs from Devon at the Bridgeport processing facility, Bridgeport and East Johnson County gathering systems and the Central Oklahoma gathering system, and these MVCs expire on January 1, 2019. We also have a five-year MVC from Devon attributable to VEX, and this MVC expires on July 31, 2019. If the volumes of natural gas and crude oil that we gather and transport on our systems are below the MVC levels after the contracts expire, we could experience a material decline in our operating revenues and cash flow. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $59.2 million, $13.8 million and $8.9 million in MVC shortfall revenue from Devon attributable to our Texas, Oklahoma and Crude and Condensate segments, respectively, because volumes were below the minimum level. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $26.4 million, $10.8 million and $9.0 million in MVC shortfall revenue from Devon attributable to our Texas, Oklahoma and Crude and Condensate segments, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $3.8 million, $20.1 million, and $0.5 million in MVC shortfall revenue from Devon attributable to our Texas, Oklahoma and Crude and Condensate segments, respectively.. Because we are substantially dependent on Devon as one of our primary customers and through its indirect control of our general partner, any development that materially and adversely affects Devon's operations, financial condition or market reputation could have a material and adverse impact on us. Material adverse changes at Devon could restrict our access to capital, make it more expensive to access the capital markets or increase the costs of our borrowings.. We are substantially dependent on Devon as one of our primary customers and through its indirect control of our general partner, and we expect to derive a significant portion of our gross operating margin from Devon for the foreseeable future. As a result, any event, whether in our area of operations or otherwise, that adversely affects Devon's production, financial condition, leverage, market reputation, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows may adversely affect our revenues and cash available for distribution. Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to the business risks of Devon, some of which are the following:. • potential changes in the supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs and related products and services;. • risks relating to Devon's exploration and drilling programs, including potential environmental liabilities;. • adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation; and. • general economic and financial market conditions.. Further, we are subject to the risk of non-payment or non-performance by Devon, including with respect to our gathering and processing agreements. We cannot predict the extent to which Devon's business will be impacted by pricing conditions in the energy industry, nor can we estimate the impact such conditions would have on Devon's ability to perform under our gathering and processing agreements. Additionally, due to our relationship with Devon, our ability to access the capital markets, or the pricing or other terms of any capital markets transactions, may be adversely affected by any impairments to Devon's financial condition or adverse changes in its credit ratings. S&P Global Ratings (\"S&P\") and Moody's Investors Services (\"Moody's\") have currently assigned to Devon a BBB and Ba1 credit rating, respectively. Any material limitations on our ability to access capital as a result of such adverse changes at Devon could limit our ability to obtain future financing under favorable terms, or at all, or could result in increased financing costs in the future. Similarly, material adverse changes at Devon could negatively impact our unit price, limiting our ability to raise capital through equity issuances or debt financing or our ability to engage in, expand or pursue our business activities and could also prevent us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us.. Please see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in Devon's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for a full discussion of the risks associated with Devon's business.. Adverse developments in our gathering, transmission, processing, crude oil, condensate, natural gas and NGL services businesses would reduce our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.. We rely exclusively on the revenues generated from our gathering, transmission, processing, fractionation, crude oil, natural gas, condensate and NGL services businesses, and as a result, our financial condition depends upon prices of, and. 38. Table of Contents. continued demand for, natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate. An adverse development in one of these businesses may have a significant impact on our financial condition and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.. A significant portion of our operations are located in the Barnett Shale, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having revenue-producing operations concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas.. Our revenue-producing operations are geographically concentrated in the Barnett Shale, causing us to be exposed to risks associated with regional factors. Specifically, our operations in the Barnett Shale accounted for approximately 11.9% of our consolidated revenues and approximately 34.1% of our consolidated gross operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2017. The concentration of our operations in this region also increases exposure to unexpected events that may occur in this region such as natural disasters or labor difficulties. Any one of these events has the potential to have a relatively significant impact on our operations and growth plans, decrease cash flows, increase operating and capital costs and prevent development within originally anticipated time frames. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.. We must continually compete for crude oil, condensate, natural gas and NGL supplies, and any decrease in supplies of such commodities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.. In order to maintain or increase throughput levels in our gathering systems and asset utilization rates at our processing plants and fractionators, we must continually contract for new product supplies. We may not be able to obtain additional contracts for crude oil, condensate, natural gas and NGL supplies. The primary factors affecting our ability to connect new wells to our gathering facilities include our success in contracting for existing supplies that are not committed to other systems and the level of drilling activity near our gathering systems. If we are unable to maintain or increase the volumes on our systems by accessing new supplies to offset the natural decline in reserves, our business and financial results could be materially, adversely affected. In addition, our future growth will depend in part upon whether we can contract for additional supplies at a greater rate than the rate of natural decline in our current supplies.. Fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new crude oil, condensate and natural gas reserves. During 2015 and 2016, we saw suppressed drilling activity due to low commodity prices. Although drilling activity has improved during 2017 in some of the most economic basins, we could see downward pressure on future drilling activity in these basins if commodity prices decline below current levels, which may result in lower volumes. Tax policy changes or additional regulatory restrictions on development could also have a negative impact on drilling activity, reducing supplies of product available to our systems and assets. Additional governmental regulation of, or delays in issuance of permits for, the offshore exploration and production industry may negatively impact current and future volumes from offshore pipelines supplying our processing plants. We have no control over producers and depend on them to maintain sufficient levels of drilling activity. A continued decrease in the level of drilling activity or a material decrease in production in our principal geographic areas for a prolonged period, as a result of unfavorable commodity prices or otherwise, likely would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. Any decrease in the volumes that we gather, process, fractionate or transport would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.. Our financial performance depends to a large extent on the volumes of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs gathered, processed, fractionated and transported on our assets. Decreases in the volumes of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs we gather, process, fractionate or transport would directly and adversely affect our financial condition. These volumes can be influenced by factors beyond our control, including:. • environmental or other governmental regulations;. • weather conditions;. • increases in storage levels of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate;. • increased use of alternative energy sources;. • decreased demand for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate;. • continued fluctuations in commodity prices, including the prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate;. • economic conditions;. • supply disruptions;. • availability of supply connected to our systems; and. • availability and adequacy of infrastructure to gather and process supply into and out of our systems.. 39. Table of Contents. The volumes of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs gathered, processed, fractionated and transported on our assets also depend on the production from the regions that supply our systems. Supply of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs can be affected by many of the factors listed above, including commodity prices and weather. In order to maintain or increase throughput levels on our systems, we must obtain new sources of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs. The primary factors affecting our ability to obtain non-dedicated sources of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs include (i) the level of successful leasing, permitting and drilling activity in our areas of operation, (ii) our ability to compete for volumes from new wells and (iii) our ability to compete successfully for volumes from sources connected to other pipelines. We have no control over the level of drilling activity in our areas of operation, the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to our systems or the rate at which production from a well declines. In addition, we have no control over producers or their drilling or production decisions, which are affected by, among other things, the availability and cost of capital, levels of reserves, availability of drilling rigs and other costs of production and equipment.. An impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, including intangible assets and equity method investments, could reduce our earnings.. GAAP requires us to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For the investments we account for under the equity method, the impairment test considers whether the fair value of the unconsolidated affiliate investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary. If we determine that an impairment is indicated, we would be required to take an immediate non-cash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized impairments on property and equipment of $12.1 million, an intangible asset impairment of $223.1 million and a goodwill impairment of $1,328.2 million. In the first quarter of 2016, we recognized an additional goodwill impairment of $873.3 million, which consisted of $566.3 million at ENLK and $307.0 million at ENLC. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized impairments on property and equipment of $17.1 million. Additional impairment of the value of our existing goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results.. Our construction of new assets may be more expensive than anticipated, may not result in revenue increases and may be subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic risks that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.. The construction of additions or modifications to our existing systems and the construction of new midstream assets involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties beyond our control including potential protests or legal actions by interested third parties, and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. Financing may not be available on economically acceptable terms or at all. If we undertake these projects, we may not be able to complete them on schedule, at the budgeted cost or at all. Moreover, our revenues may not increase due to the successful construction of a particular project. For instance, if we expand a pipeline or construct a new pipeline, the construction may occur over an extended period of time, and we may not receive any material increases in revenues promptly following completion of a project or at all. Moreover, we may construct facilities to capture anticipated future production growth in a region in which such growth does not materialize. As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the construction of additions to our existing gathering and processing assets will generally require us to obtain new rights-of-way and permits prior to constructing new pipelines or facilities. We may be unable to timely obtain such rights-of-way or permits to connect new product supplies to our existing gathering lines or capitalize on other attractive expansion opportunities. Additionally, it may become more expensive for us to obtain new rights-of-way or to expand or renew existing rights-of-way. If the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights-of-way increases, our cash flows could be adversely affected.. Construction of our major development projects subjects us to risks of construction delays, cost over-runs, limitations on our growth and negative effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.. We are engaged in the planning and construction of several major development projects, some of which will take a number of months before commercial operation. These projects are complex and subject to a number of factors beyond our control, including delays from vendors, suppliers and third-party landowners, the permitting process, changes in laws, unavailability of materials, labor disruptions, environmental hazards, financing, accidents, weather and other factors. Any delay in the completion of these projects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.. 40. Table of Contents. The construction of pipelines and gathering and processing and fractionation facilities requires the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, which may exceed our estimated costs. Estimating the timing and expenditures related to these development projects is very complex and subject to variables that can significantly increase expected costs. Should the actual costs of these projects exceed our estimates, our liquidity and capital position could be adversely affected. This level of development activity requires significant effort from our management and technical personnel and places additional requirements on our financial resources. We may not have the ability to attract and/or retain the necessary number of personnel with the skills required to bring complicated projects to successful conclusions.. Our operations are dependent on our rights and ability to receive or renew the required permits and other approvals from governmental authorities and other third parties.. Performance of our operations requires that we obtain and maintain numerous environmental and land use permits and other approvals authorizing our business activities. A decision by a governmental authority or other third party to deny, delay or restrictively condition the issuance of a new or renewed permit or other approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or other approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to initiate or continue operations at the affected location or facility. Expansion of our existing operations is also predicated on securing the necessary environmental or land use permits and other approvals, which we may not receive in a timely manner or at all.. In order to obtain permits and renewals of permits and other approvals in the future, we may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the potential adverse impact that any proposed activities may have on the environment, individually or in the aggregate, including on public and Indian lands. Certain approval procedures may require preparation of archaeological surveys, endangered species studies and other studies to assess the environmental impact of new sites or the expansion of existing sites. Compliance with these regulatory requirements is expensive and significantly lengthens the time needed to develop a site or pipeline alignment. Also, obtaining or renewing required permits or other approvals is sometimes delayed or prevented due to community opposition and other factors beyond our control. The denial of a permit or other approvals essential to our operations or the imposition of restrictive conditions with which it is not practicable or feasible to comply could impact our operations or prevent our ability to expand our operations or obtain rights-of-way. Significant opposition to a permit or other approvals by neighboring property owners, members of the public or non-governmental organizations, or other third parties or delays in the environmental review and permitting process also could impact our operations or prevent our ability to expand our operations or obtain rights-of-way.. We conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures, which subjects us to additional risks that could have a material adverse effect on the success of these operations, our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.. We participate in several joint ventures, and we may enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future. The nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties. If our joint venture partners do not fulfill their contractual and other obligations, the affected joint venture may be unable to operate according to its business plan, and we may be required to increase our level of commitment. If we do not timely meet our financial commitments or otherwise comply with our joint venture agreements, our ownership of and rights with respect to the applicable joint venture may be reduced or otherwise adversely affected. Differences in views among joint venture participants could also result in delays in business decisions or otherwise, failures to agree on major issues, operational inefficiencies and impasses, litigation or other issues. Third parties may also seek to hold us liable for the joint ventures' liabilities. These issues or any other difficulties that cause a joint venture to deviate from its original business plan could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.. Any reductions in ENLK's credit ratings could increase our financing costs, the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships and reduce ENLK's and, consequently, ENLC's cash available for distribution.. We cannot guarantee that our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. S&P and Moody's have currently assigned to ENLK a BBB- and Ba1 credit rating, respectively. Any future downgrade could increase the cost of borrowings under the ENLK Credit Facility. Any downgrade could also lead to higher borrowing costs for future borrowings and, if below investment grade, could require:. • additional or more restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on ENLK and its subsidiaries;. • ENLK's subsidiaries to guarantee such debt and certain other debt;. • ENLK and its subsidiaries to provide collateral to secure such debt; and. 41. Table of Contents. • ENLK and its subsidiaries to post cash collateral or letters of credit under our hedging arrangements or in order to purchase commodities or obtain trade credit.. Any increase in our financing costs or additional or more restrictive covenants resulting from a credit rating downgrade could adversely affect our ability to finance future operations and make cash distributions to unitholders. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant collateral requirement were to occur at a time when we were experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, our results of operations and our ability to make cash distributions to unitholders could be adversely affected.. We typically do not obtain independent evaluations of hydrocarbon reserves; therefore, volumes we service in the future could be less than we anticipate.. We typically do not obtain, on a regular basis, independent evaluations of hydrocarbon reserves connected to our gathering systems or that we otherwise service due to the unwillingness of producers to provide reserve information as well as the cost of such evaluations. Accordingly, we do not have independent estimates of total reserves serviced by our assets or the anticipated life of such reserves. If the total reserves or estimated life of the reserves is less than we anticipate and we are unable to secure additional sources, then the volumes transported on our gathering systems or that we otherwise service in the future could be less than anticipated. A decline in the volumes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.. We may not be successful in balancing our purchases and sales.. We are a party to certain long-term gas, NGL and condensate sales commitments that we satisfy through supplies purchased under long-term gas, NGL and condensate purchase agreements. When we enter into those arrangements, our sales obligations generally match our purchase obligations. However, over time, the supplies that we have under contract may decline due to reduced drilling or other causes, and we may be required to satisfy the sales obligations by purchasing additional gas at prices that may exceed the prices received under the sales commitments. In addition, a producer could fail to deliver contracted volumes or deliver in excess of contracted volumes, or a consumer could purchase more or less than contracted volumes. Any of these actions could cause our purchases and sales not to be balanced. If our purchases and sales are not balanced, we will face increased exposure to commodity price risks and could have increased volatility in our operating income.. We have made commitments to purchase natural gas in production areas based on production-area indices and to sell the natural gas into market areas based on market-area indices, pay the costs to transport the natural gas between the two points and capture the difference between the indices as margin. Changes in the index prices relative to each other (also referred to as basis spread) can significantly affect our margins or even result in losses. For example, we are a party to one contract associated with our North Texas operations with a term to July 2019 to supply approximately 150,000 MMBtu/d of gas. We buy gas for this contract on several different production-area indices and sell the gas into a different market area index. We realize a loss on the delivery of gas under this contract each month based on current prices. As of December 31, 2017, the balance sheet reflected a liability of $26.9 million related to this performance obligation based on forecasted discounted cash obligations in excess of market under this gas delivery contract. Reduced supplies and narrower basis spreads in recent periods have increased the losses on this contract, and greater losses on this contract could occur in future periods if these conditions persist or become worse.. Our profitability is dependent upon prices and market demand for crude oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs that are beyond our control and have been volatile. A depressed commodity price environment could result in financial losses and reduce our cash available for distribution.. We are subject to significant risks due to fluctuations in commodity prices. We are directly exposed to these risks primarily in the gas processing and NGL fractionation components of our business. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 3.4% of our total gross operating margin was generated under percent of liquids contracts and percent of proceeds contracts, with most of these contracts relating to our processing plants in the Permian Basin. Under percent of liquids contracts, we receive a fee in the form of a percentage of the liquids recovered, and the producer bears all the cost of the natural gas shrink. Accordingly, our revenues under percent of liquids contracts are directly impacted by the market price of NGLs. Gross operating margin under percent of proceeds contracts is impacted only by the value of the natural gas or liquids produced with margins higher during periods of higher natural gas and liquids prices.. We also realize gross operating margins under processing margin contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 1.3% of our total gross operating margin was generated under processing margin contracts. We have a number of. 42. Table of Contents. processing margin contracts for activities at our Plaquemine and Pelican processing plants. Under this type of contract, we pay the producer for the full amount of inlet gas to the plant, and we make a margin based on the difference between the value of liquids recovered from the processed natural gas as compared to the value of the natural gas volumes lost (\"shrink\") and the cost of fuel used in processing. The shrink and fuel losses are referred to as plant thermal reduction (\"PTR\"). Our margins from these contracts can be greatly reduced or eliminated during periods of high natural gas prices relative to liquids prices.. We are also indirectly exposed to commodity prices due to the negative impacts of low commodity prices on production and the development of production of crude oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs connected to or near our assets and on our margins for transportation between certain market centers. Low prices for these products have reduced the demand for our services and volumes on our systems, and continued low prices may reduce such demand even further.. Although the majority of our NGL fractionation business is under fee-based arrangements, a portion of our business is exposed to commodity price risk because we realize a margin due to product upgrades associated with our Louisiana fractionation business. For the year ended December 31, 2017, gross operating margin realized associated with product upgrades represented approximately 1.3% of our gross operating margin.. The prices of crude oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs were volatile during 2017. Crude oil and weighted average NGL prices increased 15% and 21%, while natural gas prices decreased 11%, from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, respectively. We expect this volatility to continue. For example, crude oil prices (based on the NYMEX futures daily close prices for the prompt month) in 2017 ranged from a high of $60.42 per Bbl in December 2017 to a low of $42.53 per Bbl in June 2017. Weighted average NGL prices in 2017 (based on the Oil Price Information Service (\"OPIS\") Napoleonville daily average spot liquids prices) ranged from a high of $0.78 per gallon in February 2017 to a low of $0.41 per gallon in January 2017. Natural gas prices (based on Gas Daily Henry Hub closing prices) during 2017 ranged from a high of $3.42 per MMBtu in May 2017 to a low of $2.56 per MMBtu in February 2017.. The markets and prices for crude oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs depend upon factors beyond our control that make it difficult to predict future commodity price movements with any certainty. These factors include the supply and demand for crude oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs, which fluctuate with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors, including:. • the impact of weather on the supply and demand for crude oil and natural gas;. • the level of domestic crude oil, condensate and natural gas production;. • technology, including improved production techniques (particularly with respect to shale development);. • the level of domestic industrial and manufacturing activity;. • the availability of imported crude oil, natural gas and NGLs;. • international demand for crude oil and NGLs;. • actions taken by foreign crude oil and gas producing nations;. • the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military action and civil unrest;. • the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems;. • the availability of downstream NGL fractionation facilities;. • the availability and marketing of competitive fuels;. • the impact of energy conservation efforts; and. • the extent of governmental regulation and taxation, including the regulation of hydraulic fracturing and \"greenhouse gases.\". Changes in commodity prices also indirectly impact our profitability by influencing drilling activity and well operations, and thus the volume of gas, crude oil and condensate we gather and process and NGLs we fractionate. Volatility in commodity prices may cause our gross operating margin and cash flows to vary widely from period to period. Our hedging strategies may not be sufficient to offset price volatility risk and, in any event, do not cover all of our throughput volumes. Moreover, hedges are subject to inherent risks, which we describe in \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk.\" Our use of derivative financial instruments does not eliminate our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates and has (in the past) resulted and could (in the future) result in financial losses or reductions in our income.. 43. Table of Contents. If third-party pipelines or other midstream facilities interconnected to our gathering or transportation systems become partially or fully unavailable, or if the volumes we gather, process or transport do not meet the quality requirements of the pipelines or facilities to which we connect, our gross operating margin and cash flow could be adversely affected.. Our gathering, processing and transportation assets connect to other pipelines or facilities owned and operated by unaffiliated third parties. The continuing operation of, and our continuing access to, such third-party pipelines, processing facilities and other midstream facilities is not within our control. These pipelines, plants and other midstream facilities may become unavailable because of testing, turnarounds, line repair, maintenance, reduced operating pressure, lack of operating capacity, regulatory requirements and curtailments of receipt or deliveries due to insufficient capacity or because of damage from severe weather conditions or other operational issues. Further, these pipelines and facilities connected to our assets impose product quality specifications. We may be unable to access such facilities or transport product along interconnected pipelines if the volumes we gather or transport do not meet their product quality requirements. In addition, if our costs to access and transport on these third-party pipelines significantly increase, our profitability could be reduced. If any such increase in costs occurs, if any of these pipelines or other midstream facilities become unable to receive, transport or process product, or if the volumes we gather or transport do not meet the product quality requirements of such pipelines or facilities, our operating margin and cash flow could be adversely affected.. Our debt levels could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial health or limit our flexibility to obtain financing and to pursue other business opportunities.. We continue to have the ability to incur debt, subject to limitations in the ENLC Credit Facility and the ENLK Credit Facility. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including the following:. • our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;. • our funds available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions to unitholders will be reduced by that portion of our cash flows required to make interest payments on our debt;. • our debt level will make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;. • our ability to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and. • our risk that we, or ENLK, may default on our debt obligations.. In addition, our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions, many of which are beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital. We may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all.. The terms of the ENLC Credit Facility and the ENLK Credit Facility and ENLK's indentures may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in business or to take certain actions.. The agreements governing the ENLC Credit Facility and the ENLK Credit Facility and the indentures governing ENLK's senior notes contain, and any future indebtedness we incur will likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best long-term interest. One or more of these agreements include covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:. • incur indebtedness through ENLC;. • engage in transactions with our affiliates;. • consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of our assets;. • incur liens;. • enter into sale and lease back transactions; and. • change business activities we conduct.. In addition, the ENLK Credit Facility requires us to satisfy and maintain a specified financial ratio. Our ability to meet that financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will continue to meet that ratio.. 44. Table of Contents. Our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the ENLC Credit Facility, the ENLK Credit Facility and indentures may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the ENLC Credit Facility, the ENLK Credit Facility and indentures. Upon the occurrence of such an event of default, all amounts outstanding under the applicable debt agreements could be declared to be immediately due and payable, and all applicable commitments to extend further credit could be terminated. If indebtedness under the ENLC Credit Facility, the ENLK Credit Facility or indentures is accelerated, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay the indebtedness. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in these debt agreements and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities.. Increases in interest rates could adversely impact the price of ENLC's or ENLK's common units, ENLC's or ENLK's ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and ENLC's or ENLK's ability to make cash distributions.. Interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. As with other yield-oriented securities, ENLC's and ENLK's unit price is impacted by ENLC's and ENLK's respective level of cash distributions and implied distribution yield. The distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in ENLC's or ENLK's units, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on the price of ENLC's or ENLK's common units, ENLC's or ENLK's ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and ENLC's or ENLK's ability to make cash distributions at our intended levels or at all.. We are vulnerable to operational, regulatory and other risks due to our significant assets in South Louisiana and the Texas Gulf Coast, including the effects of adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes.. Our operations and revenues could be significantly impacted by conditions in South Louisiana and the Texas Gulf Coast because we have significant assets located in these two areas. Our concentration of activity in Louisiana and the Texas Gulf Coast makes us more vulnerable than many of our competitors to the risks associated with these areas, including:. • adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes and tropical storms;. • delays or decreases in production, the availability of equipment, facilities or services; and. • changes in the regulatory environment.. Because a significant portion of our operations could experience the same condition at the same time, these conditions could have a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other midstream companies that have operations in more diversified geographic areas.. Our business is subject to a number of weather-related risks. These weather conditions can cause significant damage and disruption to our operations and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.. Virtually all of our operations are exposed to potential natural disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes, storms, floods, fires, severe temperatures and earthquakes. In particular, South Louisiana and the Texas Gulf Coast experience hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions on a frequent basis. The location of our significant assets and concentration of activity in these regions make us particularly vulnerable to weather risks in these areas.. High winds, storm surge, flooding and other natural disasters can cause significant damage and curtail our operations for extended periods during and after such weather conditions, which may result in decreased revenues and otherwise adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. These interruptions could involve significant damage to people, property or the environment, and repair time and costs could be extensive. Any such event that interrupts the revenues generated by our operations, or which causes us to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could reduce our cash available for paying distributions to our partners and, accordingly, adversely affect our financial condition and the market price of our securities.. In addition, we rely on the volumes of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs gathered, processed, fractionated and transported on our assets. These volumes are influenced by the production from the regions that supply our systems. Adverse weather conditions can cause direct or indirect disruptions to the operations of, and otherwise negatively affect, producers,. 45. Table of Contents. suppliers, customers and other third parties to which our assets are connected, even if our assets are not damaged. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.. We may also suffer reputational damage as a result of a natural disaster or other similar event. The occurrence of such an event, or a series of such events, especially if one or more of them occurs in a highly populated or sensitive area, could negatively impact public perception of our operations and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain the approvals, permits, licenses, rights-of-way or real property interests we need in order to operate our assets or complete planned growth projects.. A reduction in demand for NGL products by the petrochemical, refining or other industries or by the fuel markets could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.. The NGL products we produce have a variety of applications, including as heating fuels, petrochemical feedstocks and refining blend stocks. A reduction in demand for NGL products, whether because of general or industry specific economic conditions, new government regulations, global competition, reduced demand by consumers for products made with NGL products (for example, reduced petrochemical demand observed due to lower activity in the automobile and construction industries), increased competition from petroleum-based feedstocks due to pricing differences, mild winter weather for some NGL applications or other reasons could result in a decline in the volume of NGL products we handle or reduce the fees we charge for our services. Our NGL products and the demand for these products are affected as follows:. • Ethane. Ethane is typically supplied as purity ethane or as part of ethane-propane mix. Ethane is primarily used in the petrochemical industry as feedstock for ethylene, one of the basic building blocks for a wide range of plastics and other chemical products. Although ethane is typically extracted as part of the mixed NGL stream at gas processing plants, if natural gas prices increase significantly in relation to NGL product prices or if the demand for ethylene falls, it may be more profitable for natural gas processors to leave the ethane in the natural gas stream. Such \"ethane rejection\" reduces the volume of NGLs delivered for fractionation and marketing.. • Propane. Propane is used as a petrochemical feedstock in the production of ethylene and propylene, as a heating, engine and industrial fuel, and in agricultural applications such as crop drying. Changes in demand for ethylene and propylene could adversely affect demand for propane. The demand for propane as a heating fuel is significantly affected by weather conditions. The volume of propane sold is at its highest during the six-month peak heating season of October through March. Demand for our propane may be reduced during periods of warmer-than-normal weather.. • Normal Butane. Normal butane is used in the production of isobutane, as a refined product blending component, as a fuel gas, and in the production of ethylene and propylene. Changes in the composition of refined products resulting from governmental regulation, changes in feedstocks, products and economics, demand for heating fuel and for ethylene and propylene could adversely affect demand for normal butane.. • Isobutane. Isobutane is predominantly used in refineries to produce alkylates to enhance octane levels. Accordingly, any action that reduces demand for motor gasoline or demand for isobutane to produce alkylates for octane enhancement might reduce demand for isobutane.. • Natural Gasoline. Natural gasoline is used as a blending component for certain refined products and as a feedstock used in the production of ethylene and propylene. Changes in the mandated composition resulting from governmental regulation of motor gasoline and in demand for ethylene and propylene could adversely affect demand for natural gasoline.. NGLs and products produced from NGLs are sold in competitive global markets. Any reduced demand for ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane or natural gasoline in the markets we access for any of the reasons stated above could adversely affect demand for the services we provide as well as NGL prices, which would negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.. We expect to encounter significant competition in any new geographic areas into which we seek to expand, and our ability to enter such markets may be limited.. If we expand our operations into new geographic areas, we expect to encounter significant competition for natural gas, condensate, NGLs and crude oil supplies and markets. Competitors in these new markets will include companies larger than us, which have both lower cost of capital and greater geographic coverage, as well as smaller companies, which have lower total. 46. Table of Contents. cost structures. As a result, we may not be able to successfully develop greenfield or acquire assets located in new geographic areas and our results of operations could be adversely affected.. We do not own most of the land on which our pipelines, compression and plant facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations.. We do not own most of the land on which our pipelines, compression and plant facilities are located, and we are therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if we do not have valid rights-of-way or leases or if such rights-of-way or leases lapse or terminate. We sometimes obtain the rights to land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. Our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts, leases or otherwise, could cause us to cease operations on the affected land, increase costs related to continuing operations elsewhere and reduce our revenue.. We offer pipeline, truck, rail and barge services. Significant delays, inclement weather or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our results of operations.. We offer pipeline, truck, rail and barge services. The costs of conducting these services could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control, including rail service interruptions, new laws and regulations, rate increases, tariffs, rising fuel costs or capacity constraints. Inclement weather, including hurricanes, tornadoes, snow, ice and other weather events, can negatively impact our distribution network. In addition, rail, truck or barge accidents involving the transportation of hazardous materials could result in significant environmental penalties and remediation, claims arising from personal injury and property damage.. We could experience increased severity or frequency of trucking accidents and other claims, which could materially affect our results of operations.. Potential liability associated with accidents in the trucking industry is severe and occurrences are unpredictable. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents or workers' compensation claims or the unfavorable development of existing claims could materially adversely affect our results of operations. In the event that accidents occur, we may be unable to obtain desired contractual indemnities, and our insurance may be inadequate in certain cases. The occurrence of an event not fully insured or indemnified against, or the failure or inability of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses.. Changes in trucking regulations may increase our costs and negatively impact our results of operations.. Our trucking services are subject to regulation as motor carriers by the DOT and by various state agencies, whose regulations include certain permit requirements of state highway and safety authorities. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers over our trucking operations, generally governing such matters as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety, equipment testing and specifications and insurance requirements. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may impact our operations and affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for or the cost of providing trucking services. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent fuel emission limits, changes in the regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period, limits on vehicle weight and size and other matters, including safety requirements.. If we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or efficiently and effectively integrate the acquired assets with our asset base, our future growth will be limited.. Our ability to grow depends, in part, on our ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in cash generated from operations on a per unit basis. If we are unable to make accretive acquisitions either because we are (1) unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with them, (2) unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or at all or (3) outbid by competitors, then our future growth and our ability to increase distributions will be limited.. 47. Table of Contents. From time to time, we may evaluate and seek to acquire assets or businesses that we believe complement our existing business and related assets. We may acquire assets or businesses that we plan to use in a manner materially different from their prior owner's use. Any acquisition involves potential risks, including:. • the inability to integrate the operations of recently acquired businesses or assets, especially if the assets acquired are in a new business segment or geographic area;. • the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;. • the failure to realize expected volumes, revenues, profitability or growth;. • the failure to realize any expected synergies and cost savings;. • the coordination of geographically disparate organizations, systems and facilities;. • the assumption of unknown liabilities;. • the loss of customers or key employees from the acquired businesses;. • a significant increase in our indebtedness; and. • potential environmental or regulatory liabilities and title problems.. Management's assessment of these risks is inexact and may not reveal or resolve all existing or potential problems associated with an acquisition. Realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our operations and cash flows. If we consummate any future acquisition, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and you will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources.. We may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers, which would reduce our revenues and limit our future profitability.. The renewal or replacement of existing contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the price of, and demand for, crude oil, condensate, NGLs and natural gas in the markets we serve and competition from other midstream service providers. Our competitors include companies larger than we are, which could have both a lower cost of capital and a greater geographic coverage, as well as companies smaller than we are, which could have lower total cost structures. In addition, competition is increasing in some markets that have been overbuilt, resulting in an excess of midstream energy infrastructure capacity, or where new market entrants are willing to provide services at a discount in order to establish relationships and gain a foothold. The inability of our management to renew or replace our current contracts as they expire and to respond appropriately to changing market conditions could have a negative effect on our profitability.. In particular, our ability to renew or replace our existing contracts with industrial end-users and utilities impacts our profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 53.9% of our sales of gas transported using our physical facilities were to industrial end-users and utilities. As a consequence of the increase in competition in the industry and volatility of natural gas prices, industrial end-users and utilities may be reluctant to enter into long-term purchase contracts. Many industrial end-users purchase natural gas from more than one natural gas company and have the ability to change providers at any time. Some of these industrial end-users also have the ability to switch between gas and alternate fuels in response to relative price fluctuations in the market. Because there are numerous companies of greatly varying size and financial capacity that compete with us in marketing natural gas, we often compete in the industrial end-user and utilities markets primarily on the basis of price.. We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, and a general increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by our customers could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.. Risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by our customers are a major concern in our business. We are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers and other counterparties, such as our lenders and hedging counterparties. Any increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by our customers could adversely affect our results of operations and reduce our ability to make distributions to our unitholders. Additionally, equity values for many of our customers continue to be low. The combination of a reduction in cash flow from lower commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in our customers' liquidity and ability to make payment or perform on their obligations to us. Furthermore, some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to us.. 48. Table of Contents. Increased federal, state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives, as well as government reviews relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and reductions or delays in natural gas production by our customers, which could adversely impact our revenues.. A portion of our suppliers' and customers' natural gas production is developed from unconventional sources, such as deep gas shales, that require hydraulic fracturing as part of the completion process. State legislatures and agencies have enacted legislation and promulgated rules to regulate hydraulic fracturing, require disclosure of hydraulic fracturing chemicals, temporarily or permanently ban hydraulic fracturing and impose additional permit requirements and operational restrictions in certain jurisdictions or in environmentally sensitive areas. EPA and the BLM have also issued rules, conducted studies and made proposals that, if implemented, could either restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to further regulation. For instance, the EPA has issued final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act establishing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing, and adopted rules prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Although the EPA has announced its intention to reconsider the regulations relating to the capture of air emissions in April 2017 and has sought to stay its requirements, the rule remains in effect along with the restriction on discharges to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The BLM also adopted new rules, effective on January 17, 2017, to reduce venting, flaring and leaks during oil and natural gas production activities on onshore federal and Indian leases. Certain provisions of the BLM rule went into effect in January 2017, while others were scheduled to go into effect in January 2018. In December 2017, BLM published a final rule delaying the 2018 provisions until 2019. State and federal regulatory agencies also have recently focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste waters and an observed increase in induced seismicity, which has resulted in some regulation at the state level. For instance, in December 2016 the Oklahoma Corporation Commission released well completion seismicity guidelines for operators in the STACK play that call for hydraulic fracturing operations to be suspended following earthquakes of certain magnitudes in the vicinity. As regulatory agencies continue to study induced seismicity, additional legislative and regulatory initiatives could affect our customers' injection well operations as well as our brine disposal operations.. We cannot predict whether any additional legislation or regulations will be enacted and, if so, what the provisions would be. If additional levels of regulation and permits were required through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal or state level, that could lead to delays, increased operating costs and process prohibitions for our suppliers and customers that could reduce the volumes of natural gas that move through our gathering systems which could materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.. Transportation on certain of our natural gas pipelines is subject to federal and state rate and service regulation, which could limit the revenues we collect from our customers and adversely affect the cash available for distribution to our unitholders. The imposition of regulation on our currently unregulated natural gas pipelines also could increase our operating costs and adversely affect the cash available for distribution to our unitholders.. The rates, terms and conditions of service under which we transport natural gas in our pipeline systems in interstate commerce are subject to regulation by FERC under the NGA and Section 311 of the NGPA and the rules and regulations promulgated under those statutes. Under the NGA, FERC regulation requires that interstate natural gas pipeline rates be filed with FERC and that these rates be \"just and reasonable,\" not unduly preferential and not unduly discriminatory, although negotiated or settlement rates may be accepted in certain circumstances. Interested persons may challenge proposed new or changed rates, and FERC is authorized to suspend the effectiveness of such rates pending an investigation or hearing. FERC may also investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order a pipeline to change its rates prospectively. Accordingly, action by FERC could adversely affect our ability to establish rates that cover operating costs and allow for a reasonable return. An adverse determination in any future rate proceeding brought by or against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash available for distribution. Under the NGPA, we are required to justify our rates for interstate transportation service on a cost-of-service basis every five years. In addition, our intrastate natural gas pipeline operations are subject to regulation by various agencies of the states in which they are located. Should FERC or any of these state agencies determine that our rates for transportation service should be lowered, our business could be adversely affected.. The rates charged by our natural gas pipelines may also be affected by the ongoing uncertainty regarding FERC's income tax allowance policy as a result of ongoing proceedings at FERC related to third parties or general FERC policies. The ultimate outcome of these proceedings, which may not be definitively resolved for some time, is not certain and could result in changes to FERC's general treatment of income tax allowances in the cost of service or to the discounted cash flow return on equity. Additionally, recently enacted legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\"). 49. Table of Contents. includes a reduction in the highest marginal U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. At this time, it is uncertain how and when FERC will require this reduction in corporate tax rates to be reflected in the income tax allowance of regulated entities for rate-making purposes.  Depending upon the resolution of these issues, the cost of service rates of our interstate natural gas pipelines could be affected to the extent FERC proposes new rates or changes to our existing rates or if our rates are subject to compliance or challenged by FERC.. Our natural gas gathering and processing activities generally are exempt from FERC regulation under the Natural Gas Act. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of substantial, ongoing litigation, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC and the courts. Natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at both the state and federal levels since FERC has less extensively regulated the gathering activities of interstate pipeline transmission companies and a number of such companies have transferred gathering facilities to unregulated affiliates. Application of FERC jurisdiction to our gathering facilities could increase our operating costs, decrease our rates and adversely affect our business. Our gathering operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of gathering facilities. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on our operations, but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.. If we fail to comply with all the applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. Under the EPAct 2005, FERC has civil penalty authority to impose penalties for current violations of the NGA or NGPA of up to $1.0 million per day for each violation. The maximum penalty authority established by statute has been adjusted to $1.2 million and will continue to be adjusted periodically for inflation. FERC also has the power to order disgorgement of profits from transactions deemed to violate the NGA and EPAct 2005.. Other state and local regulations also affect our business. We are subject to some ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states where we operate. Ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes have the effect of restricting our right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to purchase or transport natural gas. Federal law leaves any economic regulation of natural gas gathering to the states, and some of the states in which we operate have adopted complaint-based or other limited economic regulation of natural gas gathering activities. States in which we operate that have adopted some form of complaint-based regulation, like Texas, generally allow natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to natural gas gathering access and rate discrimination.. Transportation on our liquids pipelines is subject to federal and state rate and service regulation, which could limit the revenues we collect from our customers and adversely affect the cash available for distribution to our unitholders. The imposition of regulation on our currently unregulated liquids pipeline operations also could increase our operating costs and adversely affect the cash available for distribution to our unitholders.. Our interstate liquids transportation pipelines are subject to regulation by FERC under the ICA, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. If, upon completion of an investigation, FERC finds that new or changed rates are unlawful, it is authorized to require the pipeline to refund revenues collected in excess of the just and reasonable rates during the term of the investigation. FERC may also investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively if it determines that the rates are unjust and unreasonable or unduly discriminatory or preferential. Under certain circumstances, FERC could limit our recovery of costs or could require us to reduce our rates and the payment of reparations to complaining shippers for up to two years prior to the date of the complaint. In particular, ongoing uncertainty surrounding FERC's current income tax allowance policy could affect our rates going forward, as could proposed changes to FERC's annual indexing methodology, including adoption of a policy that would deny proposed index increases for pipelines under certain circumstances where revenues exceed cost-of-service numbers by a certain percentage or where the proposed index increases exceed certain annual cost changes, all of which could have a material impact on our business. Such changes, if accepted, could decrease our rates and adversely affect our business.. As we acquire, construct and operate new liquids assets and expand our liquids transportation business, the classification and regulation of our liquids transportation services, including services that our marketing companies provide on our FERC-regulated liquids pipelines, are subject to ongoing assessment and change based on the services we provide and determinations. 50. Table of Contents. by FERC and the courts. Such changes may subject additional services we provide to regulation by FERC, which could increase our operating costs, decrease our rates and adversely affect our business.. We may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from compliance with pipeline safety regulations.. The pipelines we own and operate are subject to stringent and complex regulation related to pipeline safety and integrity management. For instance, the Department of Transportation, through PHMSA, has established a series of rules that require pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for hazardous liquid (including oil) pipeline segments that, in the event of a leak or rupture, could affect HCAs. PHMSA also recently proposed rules that would expand existing integrity management requirements to natural gas transmission and gathering lines in areas with medium population densities. Additional action by PHMSA with respect to pipeline integrity management requirements may occur in the future. At this time, we cannot predict the cost of such requirements, but they could be significant. Moreover, violations of pipeline safety regulations can result in the imposition of significant penalties.. Several states have also passed legislation or promulgated rules to address pipeline safety. Compliance with pipeline integrity laws and other pipeline safety regulations issued by state agencies such as the TRRC could result in substantial expenditures for testing, repairs and replacement. For example, TRRC regulations require periodic testing of all intrastate pipelines meeting certain size and location requirements. Our costs relating to compliance with the required testing under the TRRC regulations were approximately $2.3 million, $3.3 million and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. If our pipelines fail to meet the safety standards mandated by the TRRC or PHMSA regulations, then we may be required to repair or replace sections of such pipelines or operate the pipelines at a reduced operating pressure, the cost of which actions cannot be estimated at this time.. Due to the possibility of new or amended laws and regulations or reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that future compliance with PHMSA or state requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial positions. Moreover, because certain of our operations are located around urban or more populated areas, such as the Barnett Shale, we may incur additional expenses from compliance with municipal and other local or state regulations that impose various obligations including, among other things, regulating the locations of our facilities; limiting the noise, odor, or light levels of our facilities; and requiring certain other improvements, including to the appearance of our facilities, that result in increased costs for our facilities. We are also subject to claims by neighboring landowners for nuisance related to the construction and operation of our facilities, which could subject us to damages for declines in neighboring property values due to our construction and operation activities.. Failure to comply with existing or new environmental laws or regulations or an accidental release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or wastes into the environment may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities.. Many of the operations and activities of our pipelines, gathering systems, processing plants, fractionators, brine disposal operations and other facilities are subject to significant federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which can result in administrative, civil and criminal penalties, including civil fines, injunctions or both. The obligations imposed by these laws and regulations include obligations related to air emissions and discharge of pollutants from our pipelines and other facilities and the cleanup of hazardous substances and other wastes that are or may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or locations to which we have sent wastes for treatment or disposal. These laws impose strict, joint and several liability for the remediation of contaminated areas. Private parties, including the owners of properties near our facilities or upon or through which our gathering systems traverse, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance and to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws for releases of contaminants or for personal injury or property damage.. Our business may be adversely affected by increased costs due to stricter pollution control requirements or liabilities resulting from non-compliance with required operating or other regulatory permits. New environmental laws or regulations, including, for example, legislation relating to the control of greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in existing environmental laws or regulations might adversely affect our products and activities, including processing, storage and transportation, as well as waste management and air emissions. Federal and state agencies could also impose additional safety requirements, any of which could affect our profitability. Changes in laws or regulations could also limit our production or the operation of our assets or adversely affect our ability to comply with applicable legal requirements or the demand for crude oil, brine disposal services or natural gas, which could adversely affect our business and our profitability.. 51. Table of Contents. Recent rules under the Clean Air Act imposing more stringent requirements on the oil and gas industry could cause our customers and us to incur increased capital expenditures and operating costs as well as reduce the demand for our services.. We are subject to stringent and complex regulation under the federal Clean Air Act, implementing regulations, and state and local equivalents, including regulations related to controls for oil and natural gas production, pipelines, and processing operations. For instance, the EPA finalized new rules, effective August 2, 2016, to regulate emissions of methane and volatile organic compounds from new and modified sources in the oil and gas sector. The EPA announced its intention to reconsider those regulations in April 2017 and has sought to stay its requirements. However, the rule remains in effect. The EPA also finalized a rule regarding the alternative criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air quality permitting purposes. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source if within one quarter-mile of one another, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements across the oil and gas industry. In addition, on November 10, 2016, the EPA issued a final Information Collection Request (\"ICR\") that requires numerous oil and gas companies to provide information regarding methane emissions from existing oil and gas facilities, a step used to provide a basis for future rulemaking. The EPA withdrew this ICR in March of 2017. The BLM also adopted new rules on November 15, 2016, effective January 17, 2017, to reduce venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and natural gas production activities on onshore federal and Indian leases. Certain provisions of the BLM rule went into effect in January 2017, while others were scheduled to go into effect in January 2018. In December 2017, BLM published a final rule delaying the 2018 provisions until 2019.. Additional regulation of GHG emissions from the oil and gas industry remains a possibility. These regulations could require a number of modifications to our operations, and our natural gas exploration and production suppliers' and customers' operations, including the installation of new equipment, which could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs. The incurrence of such expenditures and costs by our suppliers and customers could result in reduced production by those suppliers and customers and thus translate into reduced demand for our services. Responding to rule challenges, the EPA has since revised certain aspects of its April 2012 rules and has indicated that it may reconsider other aspects of the rules.. Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the natural gas and NGL services we provide.. The United States Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation. In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues. In 2015, the United States participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the adoption of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement became effective November 4, 2016 and requires countries to review and \"represent a progression\" in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. Although the Trump Administration has announced its intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, the earliest effective date of this withdrawal pursuant to the terms of the Paris Agreement is November 2020. At the federal regulatory level, both the EPA and the BLM have adopted regulations for the control of methane emissions, which also include leak detection and repair requirements, from the oil and gas industry.. In addition, many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and NGL fractionation plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved.. Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether future legislation or new regulations may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions or how such measures would impact our business, the adoption of legislation or regulations imposing reporting or permitting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur additional costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations, could adversely affect our performance of operations in the absence of any permits that may be required to regulate emission of GHGs or could adversely affect demand for the natural gas we gather, process or otherwise handle in connection with our services.. 52. Table of Contents. The ESA and MBTA govern our operations and additional restrictions may be imposed in the future, which could have an adverse impact on our operations.. The ESA and analogous state laws restrict activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the MBTA. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and state agencies may designate critical or suitable habitat areas that they believe are necessary for the survival of threatened or endangered species, which could materially restrict use of or access to federal, state and private lands. Some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species or that may attract migratory birds. In these areas, we may be obligated to develop and implement plans to avoid potential adverse impacts to protected species, and we may be prohibited from conducting operations in certain locations or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons, when our operations could have an adverse effect on the species. It is also possible that a federal or state agency could order a complete halt to our activities in certain locations if it is determined that such activities may have a serious adverse effect on a protected species. In addition, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and state agencies regularly review species that are listing candidates, and designations of additional endangered or threatened species, or critical or suitable habitat, under the ESA could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas.. Our business involves many hazards and operational risks, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance. The occurrence of a significant accident or other event that is not fully insured could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.. Our operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in the gathering, compressing, processing, transporting, fractionating, disposing and storage of natural gas, NGLs, condensate, crude oil and brine, including:. • damage to pipelines, facilities, storage caverns, equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, floods, sink holes, fires and other natural disasters and acts of terrorism;. • inadvertent damage to our assets from construction or farm equipment;. • leaks of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, condensate and other hydrocarbons;. • induced seismicity;. • rail accidents, barge accidents and truck accidents;. • equipment failure; and. • fires and explosions.. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage and may result in curtailment or suspension of our related operations. We are not fully insured against all risks incident to our business. In accordance with typical industry practice, we have appropriate levels of business interruption and property insurance on our underground pipeline systems. We are not insured against all environmental accidents that might occur. If a significant accident or event occurs that is not fully insured, it could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.. The adoption of derivatives legislation by the United States Congress and promulgation of related regulations could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.. Comprehensive financial reform legislation was signed into law by the President on July 21, 2010. The legislation calls for the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (\"CFTC\") to regulate certain markets for derivative products, including over-the-counter (\"OTC\") derivatives. The CFTC has issued several new relevant regulations and other rulemakings are pending at the CFTC, the product of which would be rules that implement the mandates in the new legislation to cause significant portions of derivatives markets to clear through clearinghouses. While some of these rules have been finalized, some have not and, as a result, the final form and timing of the implementation of the new regulatory regime affecting commodity derivatives remains uncertain.. In particular, on October 18, 2011, the CFTC adopted final rules under the Dodd-Frank Act establishing position limits for certain energy commodity futures and options contracts and economically equivalent swaps, futures and options. The position limit levels set the maximum amount of covered contracts that a trader may own or control separately or in combination, net long or short. The final rules also contained limited exemptions from position limits which would be phased in over time for certain bona fide hedging transactions and positions. The CFTC's original position limits rule was challenged in court by two industry associations and was vacated and remanded by a federal district court. However, the CFTC proposed and revised new rules in November 2013 and December 2016, respectively, that would place limits on positions in certain core futures and. 53. Table of Contents. equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. The CFTC has sought comment on the position limits rule as reproposed, but these new position limit rules are not yet final and the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time. The CFTC has withdrawn its appeal of the court order vacating the original position limits rule.. The legislation and new regulations may also require counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties. The new legislation and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures and to generate sufficient cash flow to pay quarterly distributions at current levels or at all. Our revenues could be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material, adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations.. Our use of derivative financial instruments does not eliminate our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates and has in the past and could in the future result in financial losses or reduce our income.. Our operations expose us to fluctuations in commodity prices, and the ENLK Credit Facility and ENLC Credit Facility expose us to fluctuations in interest rates. We use over-the-counter price and basis swaps with other natural gas merchants and financial institutions. Use of these instruments is intended to reduce our exposure to short-term volatility in commodity prices. As of December 31, 2017, we have hedged only portions of our expected exposures to commodity price risk. In addition, to the extent we hedge our commodity price risk using swap instruments, we will forego the benefits of favorable changes in commodity prices. Although we do not currently have any financial instruments to eliminate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations, we may use financial instruments in the future to offset our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.. Even though monitored by management, our hedging activities may fail to protect us and could reduce our earnings and cash flow. Our hedging activity may be ineffective or adversely affect cash flow and earnings because, among other factors:. • hedging can be expensive, particularly during periods of volatile prices;. • our counterparty in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay or otherwise fail to perform; and. • available hedges may not correspond directly with the risks against which we seek protection. For example:. • the duration of a hedge may not match the duration of the risk against which we seek protection;. • variations in the index we use to price a commodity hedge may not adequately correlate with variations in the index we use to sell the physical commodity (known as basis risk); and. • we may not produce or process sufficient volumes to cover swap arrangements we enter into for a given period. If our actual volumes are lower than the volumes we estimated when entering into a swap for the period, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative obligation without the benefit of cash flow from our sale or purchase of the underlying physical commodity, which could adversely affect our liquidity.. A failure in our computer systems or a terrorist or cyber-attack on us, or third parties with whom we have a relationship, may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.. We are reliant on technology to conduct our business. Our business is dependent upon our operational and financial computer systems to process the data necessary to conduct almost all aspects of our business, including operating our pipelines, truck fleet and storage facilities, recording and reporting commercial and financial transactions and receiving and making payments. Any failure of our computer systems, or those of our customers, suppliers or others with whom we do business, could materially disrupt our ability to operate our business. Unknown entities or groups have mounted so-called \"cyber-attacks\" on businesses to disable or disrupt computer systems, disrupt operations and steal funds or data. Cyber-attacks could also result in the loss of confidential or proprietary data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt our operations and critical business functions. In addition, our pipeline systems may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to conduct our business and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Strategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be at greater risk of future terrorist or cyber-attacks than other targets in the United States. Our insurance may not protect us against such occurrences. Any such terrorist or cyber-attack that affects us or our customers, suppliers or others with whom we do business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause us to incur a material financial loss, subject us to possible legal claims and liability and/or damage our reputation.. 54. Table of Contents. Moreover, as the sophistication of cyber attacks continues to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance our digital security or to remediate vulnerabilities. In addition, cyber-attacks against us or others in our industry could result in additional regulations, which could lead to increased regulatory compliance costs, insurance coverage cost or capital expenditures. We cannot predict the potential impact to our business or the energy industry resulting from additional regulations.. Our success depends on key members of our management, the loss or replacement of whom could disrupt our business operations.. We depend on the continued employment and performance of the officers of our general partner and key operational personnel. If any of these officers or other key personnel resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and are not adequately replaced, our business operations could be materially adversely affected. We do not maintain any \"key man\" life insurance for any officers.. Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could reduce labor productivity and increase labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. Gathering and compression services require laborers skilled in multiple disciplines, such as equipment operators, mechanics and engineers, among others. Our business is dependent on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. Certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skill sets to future needs, competition for skilled labor or the unavailability of contract resources, may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Our costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations could be negatively affected.. Subsidence and coastal erosion could damage our pipelines along the Gulf Coast and offshore and the facilities of our customers, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.. Our pipeline operations along the Gulf Coast and offshore could be impacted by subsidence and coastal erosion. Such processes could cause serious damage to our pipelines, which could affect our ability to provide transportation services. Additionally, such processes could impact our customers who operate along the Gulf Coast, and they may be unable to utilize our services. Subsidence and coastal erosion could also expose our operations to increased risks associated with severe weather conditions, such as hurricanes, flooding and rising sea levels. As a result, we may incur significant costs to repair and preserve our pipeline infrastructure. Such costs could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.. Our assets were constructed over many decades using varying construction and coating techniques, which may cause our inspection, maintenance or repair costs to increase in the future. In addition, there could be service interruptions due to unknown events or conditions or increased downtime associated with our pipelines that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.. Our pipelines were constructed over many decades. Pipelines are generally long-lived assets, and pipeline construction and coating techniques have varied over time and can vary for individual pipelines. Depending on the construction era and quality, some assets will require more frequent inspections or repairs, which could result in increased maintenance or repair expenditures in the future. Any significant increase in these expenditures could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows."
