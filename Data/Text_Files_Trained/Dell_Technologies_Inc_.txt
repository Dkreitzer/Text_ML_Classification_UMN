[1] "ITEM 1A  -  RISK FACTORS. Our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects are subject to a variety of significant risks, many of which are beyond our control.  The following is a description of some of the important risk factors that may cause our actual results in future periods to differ substantially from those we currently expect or seek.  The risks described below are not the only risks facing us.  There are additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that also may materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, or prospects.. Risk Factors Relating to Our Business. Competitive pressures may adversely affect Dell Technologies' industry unit share position, revenue, and profitability.. Dell Technologies operates in an industry in which there are rapid technological advances in hardware, software, and services offerings.  As a result, Dell Technologies faces aggressive product and price competition from both branded and generic competitors.  Dell Technologies competes based on its ability to offer to its customers competitive integrated solutions that provide the most current and desired product and services features.  There is a risk that Dell Technologies' competitors may provide products that are less costly, perform better or include additional features that are not available with Dell Technologies' products.  There also is a risk that Dell Technologies' product portfolios may quickly become outdated or that Dell Technologies' market share may quickly erode.  Further, efforts to balance the mix of products and services in order to optimize profitability, liquidity, and growth may put pressure on Dell Technologies' industry position.. As the technology industry continues to expand globally, there may be new and increased competition in different geographic regions.  The generally low barriers to entry in the technology industry increase the potential for challenges from new industry competitors.  There also may be increased competition from new types of products as the options for mobile and cloud computing solutions increase.  In addition, companies with which Dell Technologies has strategic alliances may become competitors in other product areas or current competitors may enter into new strategic relationships with new or existing competitors, all of which may further increase the competitive pressures on Dell Technologies.. Reliance on vendors for products and components, many of which are single-source or limited-source suppliers, could harm Dell Technologies' business by adversely affecting product availability, delivery, reliability, and cost.. Dell Technologies maintains several single-source or limited-source supplier relationships, including relationships with third-party software providers, either because multiple sources are not readily available or because the relationships are advantageous due to performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity, or price considerations.  A delay in the supply of a critical single- or limited-source product or component may prevent the timely shipment of the related product in desired quantities or configurations.  In addition, Dell Technologies may not be able to replace the functionality provided by third-party software currently offered with its products if that software becomes obsolete, defective, or incompatible with future product versions or is not adequately maintained or updated.  Even where multiple sources of supply are available, qualification of the alternative suppliers and establishment of reliable supplies could result in delays and a possible loss of sales, which could harm Dell Technologies' operating results.. Dell Technologies obtains many of its products and all of its components from third-party vendors, many of which are located outside of the United States.  In addition, significant portions of Dell Technologies' products are assembled by contract manufacturers, primarily in various locations in Asia.  A significant concentration of such outsourced manufacturing is currently performed by only a few of Dell Technologies' contract manufacturers, often in single locations.  Dell Technologies sells components to these contract manufacturers and generates large non-trade accounts receivables, an arrangement that would present a risk of uncollectibility if the financial condition of a contract manufacturer should deteriorate.. Although these relationships generate cost efficiencies, they limit Dell Technologies' direct control over production.  The increasing reliance on vendors subjects Dell Technologies to a greater risk of shortages and reduced control over delivery schedules of components and products, as well as a greater risk of increases in product and component costs.  Because Dell Technologies maintains minimal levels of component and product inventories, a disruption in component or product availability could harm Dell Technologies' ability to satisfy customer needs.  In addition, defective parts and products from these vendors could reduce product reliability and harm Dell Technologies' reputation.. 16. Table of Contents. If Dell Technologies fails to achieve favorable pricing from vendors, its profitability could be adversely affected.. Dell Technologies' profitability is affected by its ability to achieve favorable pricing from vendors and contract manufacturers, including through negotiations for vendor rebates, marketing funds, and other vendor funding received in the normal course of business.  Because these supplier negotiations are continuous and reflect the evolving competitive environment, the variability in timing and amount of incremental vendor discounts and rebates can affect Dell Technologies' profitability.  The vendor programs may change periodically, potentially resulting in adverse profitability trends if Dell Technologies cannot adjust pricing or variable costs.  An inability to establish a cost and product advantage, or determine alternative means to deliver value to customers, may adversely affect Dell Technologies' revenue and profitability.. Adverse global economic conditions and instability in financial markets may harm Dell Technologies' business and result in reduced net revenue and profitability.. As a global company with customers operating in a broad range of businesses and industries, Dell Technologies' performance is affected by global economic conditions.  Adverse economic conditions may negatively affect customer demand for Dell Technologies' products and services.  Such economic conditions could result in postponed or decreased spending amid customer concerns over unemployment, reduced asset values, volatile energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, and the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial markets, businesses, local and state governments, and sovereign nations.  Weak global economic conditions also could harm Dell Technologies' business by contributing to product shortages or delays, insolvency of key suppliers, customer and counterparty insolvencies, and increased challenges in managing Dell Technologies' treasury operations.  Any such effects could have a negative impact on Dell Technologies' net revenue and profitability.. Dell Technologies' results of operations may be adversely affected if it fails to successfully execute its growth strategy.. Dell Technologies' growth strategy involves reaching more customers through direct sales, new distribution channels, expanding relationships with resellers, and augmenting select business areas through targeted acquisitions and other commercial arrangements.  As more customers are reached through new distribution channels and expanded reseller relationships, Dell Technologies may fail to manage effectively the increasingly difficult tasks of inventory management and demand forecasting.  The ability to implement this growth strategy depends on a successful transitioning of sales capabilities, the successful addition to the breadth of Dell Technologies' solutions capabilities through selective acquisitions of other businesses, and the effective management of the consequences of these strategic initiatives.  If Dell Technologies is unable to meet these challenges, its results of operations could be adversely affected.. Dell Technologies faces risks and challenges in connection with its transformation to an essential infrastructure solutions provider and its business strategy.. Dell Technologies expects its strategic transformation to an essential infrastructure solutions provider to take more time and investment, and the investments it must make are likely to result in lower gross margins and raise its operating expenses and capital expenditures.. For Fiscal 2018, Dell Technologies' Client Solutions business generated approximately 50% of Dell Technologies' net revenue, and largely relied on PC sales.  Revenue from Client Solutions absorbs Dell Technologies' significant overhead costs and allows for scaled procurement.  As a result, Client Solutions remains an important component in Dell Technologies' broad transformation strategy.  While Dell Technologies continues to rely on Client Solutions as a critical element of its business, Dell Technologies also anticipates an increasingly challenging demand environment in Client Solutions and intensifying market competition.  Current challenges in Client Solutions stem from fundamental changes in the PC market, including a decline in worldwide revenues for desktop and laptop PCs, and lower shipment forecasts for PC products due to a general lengthening of the replacement cycle for PC products and increasing interest in alternative mobile solutions.  PC shipments worldwide declined during calendar year 2017, and further deterioration in the PC market may occur.  Other challenges include declining margins as demand for PC products shifts from higher-margin premium products to lower-cost and lower-margin products, particularly in emerging markets, and significant and increasing competition from efficient and low-cost manufacturers and from manufacturers of innovative and higher-margin PC products.. The challenges Dell Technologies faces in its transformation include low operating margins for the Infrastructure Solutions Group, referred to as ISG, and, although Client Solutions drives pull-through revenue and cross-selling of ISG solutions, the potential for further margin erosion remains due to intense competition, including emerging competitive pressure from cloud services.  Improving the integration of Dell Technologies' product and service offerings as well as its ability to cross-sell remain. 17. Table of Contents. a work in progress, as Dell Technologies is in the early stages of integrating its products into solutions and thus far has limited overlap in the base of large customers for the Client Solutions business and the ISG business.  In addition, returns from Dell Technologies' prior acquisitions have been mixed and will require additional investments to reposition the business for growth, while cross-selling synergies have not been achieved as anticipated.  As a result of the foregoing challenges, Dell Technologies' business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.. Dell Technologies may not successfully implement its acquisition strategy, which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and increased costs.. Dell Technologies makes strategic acquisitions of other companies as part of its growth strategy.  Dell Technologies could experience unforeseen operating difficulties in assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, services, products, personnel, or operations of acquired companies, especially if Dell Technologies is unable to retain the key personnel of an acquired company.  Further, future acquisitions may result in a delay or reduction of sales for both Dell Technologies and the acquired company because of customer uncertainty about the continuity and effectiveness of solutions offered by either company and may disrupt Dell Technologies' existing business by diverting resources and significant management attention that otherwise would be focused on development of the existing business.  Acquisitions also may negatively affect Dell Technologies' relationships with strategic partners if the acquisitions are seen as bringing Dell Technologies into competition with such partners.. To complete an acquisition, Dell Technologies may be required to use substantial amounts of cash, engage in equity or debt financings, or enter into credit agreements to secure additional funds.  Such debt financings could involve restrictive covenants that might limit Dell Technologies' capital-raising activities and operating flexibility.  Further, an acquisition may negatively affect Dell Technologies' results of operations because it may expose Dell Technologies to unexpected liabilities, require the incurrence of charges and substantial indebtedness or other liabilities, have adverse tax consequences, result in acquired in-process research and development expenses, or in the future require the amortization, write-down or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation, goodwill, and other intangible assets, or fail to generate a financial return sufficient to offset acquisition costs.. In addition, Dell Technologies periodically divests businesses, including businesses that are no longer a part of its strategic plan.  These divestitures similarly require significant investment of time and resources, may disrupt Dell Technologies' business and distract management from other responsibilities, and may result in losses on disposition or continued financial involvement in the divested business, including through indemnification or other financial arrangements, for a period following the transaction, which could adversely affect Dell Technologies' financial results.. If its cost efficiency measures are not successful, Dell Technologies may become less competitive.. Dell Technologies continues to focus on minimizing operating expenses through cost improvements and simplification of its corporate structure.  Certain factors may prevent the achievement of these goals, which may negatively affect Dell Technologies' competitive position.  For example, Dell Technologies may experience delays or unanticipated costs in implementing its cost efficiency plans, which could prevent the timely or full achievement of expected cost efficiencies.. Dell Technologies' inability to manage solutions and product and services transitions in an effective manner could reduce the demand for Dell Technologies' solutions, products, and services, and the profitability of Dell Technologies' operations.. Continuing improvements in technology result in the frequent introduction of new solutions, products, and services, improvements in product performance characteristics, and short product life cycles.  If Dell Technologies fails to manage in an effective manner transitions to new solutions and offerings, the products and services associated with such offerings and customer demand for Dell Technologies' solutions, products, and services could diminish, and Dell Technologies' profitability could suffer.. Dell Technologies is increasingly sourcing new products and transitioning existing products through its contract manufacturers and manufacturing outsourcing relationships in order to generate cost efficiencies and better serve its customers.  The success of product transitions depends on a number of factors, including the availability of sufficient quantities of components at attractive costs.  Product transitions also present execution challenges and risks, including the risk that new or upgraded products may have quality issues or other defects.. 18. Table of Contents. Failure to deliver high-quality hardware, software, and services could lead to loss of customers and diminished profitability.. Dell Technologies must identify and address quality issues associated with its hardware, software, and services, many of which include third-party components.  Although quality testing is performed regularly to detect quality problems and implement required solutions, failure to identify and correct significant product quality issues before the sale of such products to customers could result in lower sales, increased warranty or replacement expenses, and reduced customer confidence, which could harm Dell Technologies' operating results.. Dell Technologies' ability to generate substantial non-U.S. net revenue is subject to additional risks and uncertainties.. Sales outside the United States accounted for approximately 51% of Dell Technologies' consolidated net revenue for Fiscal 2018.  Dell Technologies' future growth rates and success are substantially dependent on the continued growth of Dell Technologies' business outside of the United States.  Dell Technologies' international operations face many risks and uncertainties, including varied local economic and labor conditions, political instability, changes in the U.S. and international regulatory environments, and the impacts of trade protection measures, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign operations), copyright levies, and foreign currency exchange rates.  Any of these factors could negatively affect Dell Technologies' international business results and prospects for growth.. Dell Technologies' profitability may be adversely affected by product, customer, and geographic sales mix, and seasonal sales trends.. Dell Technologies' overall profitability for any period may be adversely affected by changes in the mix of products, customers, and geographic markets reflected in sales for that period, and by seasonal trends.  Profit margins vary among products, services, customers, and geographic markets.  For instance, services offerings generally have a higher profit margin than consumer products.  In addition, parts of Dell Technologies' business are subject to seasonal sales trends.  Among the trends with the most significant impact on Dell Technologies' operating results, sales to government customers (particularly the U.S. federal government) are typically stronger in Dell Technologies' third fiscal quarter, sales in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa are often weaker in Dell Technologies' third fiscal quarter, and sales to consumers are typically strongest during Dell Technologies' fourth fiscal quarter.. Dell Technologies may lose revenue opportunities and experience gross margin pressure if sales channel participants fail to perform as expected.. Dell Technologies relies on third-party value-added resellers, system integrators, distributors, retailers, and other sales channels to complement its direct sales organization in order to reach more end-users globally.  Future operating results  depend on the performance of sales channel participants and on Dell Technologies' success in maintaining and developing these relationships.  Revenue and gross margins could be negatively affected if the financial condition or operations of channel participants weaken as a result of adverse economic conditions or other business challenges, or if uncertainty regarding the demand for Dell Technologies' products causes channel participants to reduce their orders for these products.  Further, some channel participants may consider the expansion of Dell Technologies' direct sales initiatives to conflict with their business interests as distributors or resellers of Dell Technologies' products, which could lead them to reduce their investment in the distribution and sale of such products, or to cease all sales of Dell Technologies' products.. Dell Technologies' financial performance could suffer from reduced access to the capital markets by Dell Technologies or some of its customers.. Dell Technologies may access debt and capital sources to provide financing for customers and to obtain funds for general corporate purposes, including working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and funding of customer receivables.  In addition, Dell Technologies maintains customer financing relationships with some companies that rely on access to the debt and capital markets to meet significant funding needs.  Any inability of these companies to access such markets could compel Dell Technologies to self-fund transactions with such companies or to forgo customer financing opportunities, which could harm Dell Technologies' financial performance.  The debt and capital markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption from time to time in the future, which could result in higher credit spreads in such markets and higher funding costs for Dell Technologies.  Deterioration in Dell Technologies' business performance, a credit rating downgrade, volatility in the securitization markets, changes in financial services regulation, or adverse changes in the economy could lead to reductions in the availability of debt financing.  In addition, these events could limit Dell Technologies' ability to continue asset securitizations or other forms of financing from debt or capital sources, reduce the amount of financing receivables that Dell. 19. Table of Contents. Technologies originates, or negatively affect the costs or terms on which Dell Technologies may be able to obtain capital.  Any of these developments could adversely affect Dell Technologies' net revenue, profitability, and cash flows.. Weak economic conditions and additional regulation could harm Dell Technologies' financial services activities.. Dell Technologies' financial services activities are negatively affected by adverse economic conditions that contribute to loan delinquencies and defaults.  An increase in loan delinquencies and defaults would result in greater net credit losses, which may require Dell Technologies to increase its reserves for customer receivables.  In addition, the implementation of new financial services regulation, or the application of existing financial services regulation in countries where Dell Technologies expands its financial services and related supporting activities, could unfavorably affect the profitability and cash flows of Dell Technologies' consumer financing activities.. Dell Technologies is subject to counterparty default risks.. Dell Technologies has numerous arrangements with financial institutions that include cash and investment deposits, interest rate swap contracts, foreign currency option contracts, and forward contracts.  As a result, Dell Technologies is subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default, either voluntarily or involuntarily, on its performance under the terms of the arrangement.  In times of market distress, a counterparty may default rapidly and without notice, and Dell Technologies may be unable to take action to cover its exposure, either because of lack of contractual ability to do so or because market conditions make it difficult to take effective action.  If one of Dell Technologies' counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, Dell Technologies' ability eventually to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty's default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable legal regime governing the bankruptcy proceeding.  In the event of such a default, Dell Technologies could incur significant losses, which could harm Dell Technologies' business and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.. The exercise by customers of certain rights under their services contracts with Dell Technologies, or Dell Technologies' failure to perform as it anticipates at the time it enters into services contracts, could adversely affect Dell Technologies' revenue and profitability.. Many of Dell Technologies' services contracts allow customers to take actions that may adversely affect Dell Technologies' revenue and profitability.  These actions include terminating a contract if Dell Technologies' performance does not meet specified service levels, requesting rate reductions or contract termination, reducing the use of Dell Technologies' services, or terminating a contract early upon payment of agreed fees.  In addition, Dell Technologies estimates the costs of delivering the services at the outset of the contract.  If Dell Technologies fails to estimate such costs accurately and actual costs significantly exceed estimates, Dell Technologies may incur losses on the services contracts.. Loss of government contracts could harm Dell Technologies' business.. Contracts with U.S. federal, state, and local governments and with foreign governments are subject to future funding that may affect the extension or termination of programs and to the right of such governments to terminate contracts for convenience or non-appropriation.  There is pressure on governments, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending.  Funding reductions or delays could adversely affect public sector demand for Dell Technologies' products and services.  In addition, if Dell Technologies violates legal or regulatory requirements, the applicable government could suspend or disbar Dell Technologies as a contractor, which would unfavorably affect Dell Technologies' net revenue and profitability.. Dell Technologies' business could suffer if Dell Technologies does not develop and protect its proprietary intellectual property or obtain or protect licenses to intellectual property developed by others on commercially reasonable and competitive terms.. If Dell Technologies or its suppliers are unable to develop or protect desirable technology or technology licenses, Dell Technologies may be prevented from marketing products, may have to market products without desirable features, or may incur substantial costs to redesign products.  Dell Technologies also may have to defend or enforce legal actions or pay damages if Dell Technologies is found to have violated the intellectual property of other parties.  Although Dell Technologies' suppliers might be contractually obligated to obtain or protect such licenses and indemnify Dell Technologies against related expenses, those suppliers could be unable to meet their obligations.  Although Dell Technologies invests in research and development and obtains additional intellectual property through acquisitions, those activities do not guarantee that Dell Technologies will develop or obtain intellectual property necessary for profitable operations.  Costs involved in developing and protecting rights in intellectual property may have a negative impact on Dell Technologies' business.  In addition, Dell Technologies' operating. 20. Table of Contents. costs could increase because of copyright levies or similar fees by rights holders and collection agencies in European and other countries.. Infrastructure disruptions could harm Dell Technologies' business.. Dell Technologies depends on its information technology and manufacturing infrastructure to achieve its business objectives.  Natural disasters, manufacturing failures, telecommunications system failures, or defective or improperly installed new or upgraded business management systems could lead to disruptions in this infrastructure.  Portions of Dell Technologies' IT infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service, or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work.  Such disruptions may adversely affect Dell Technologies' ability to receive or process orders, manufacture and ship products in a timely manner or otherwise conduct business in the normal course.  Further, portions of Dell Technologies' services business involve the processing, storage, and transmission of data, which also would be negatively affected by such an event.  Disruptions in Dell Technologies' infrastructure could lead to loss of customers and revenue, particularly during a period of heavy demand for Dell Technologies' products and services.  Dell Technologies also could incur significant expense in repairing system damage and taking other remedial measures.. Cyber attacks or other data security incidents that disrupt Dell Technologies' operations or result in the breach or other compromise of proprietary or confidential information about Dell Technologies or Dell Technologies' workforce, customers, or other third parties could disrupt Dell Technologies' business, harm its reputation, cause Dell Technologies to lose clients, and expose Dell Technologies to costly regulatory enforcement and litigation.. Dell Technologies manages, stores, and otherwise processes various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to its operations.  In addition, Dell Technologies' cloud computing businesses routinely process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including sensitive and personally identifiable information, for Dell Technologies' customers.  Dell Technologies may experience breaches or other compromise of the information technology systems it uses for these purposes, as criminal or other actors may be able to penetrate Dell Technologies' network security and misappropriate or compromise Dell Technologies' confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns.  Further, hardware and operating system software and applications that Dell Technologies produces or procures from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \"bugs\" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of such systems.. The costs to address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant.  Remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede Dell Technologies' sales, manufacturing, distribution, or other critical functions.  Dell Technologies could lose existing or potential customers for outsourcing services or other information technology solutions in connection with any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in Dell Technologies' products.  In addition, breaches of Dell Technologies' security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about Dell Technologies or its customers or other third parties could expose Dell Technologies, its customers, or other third parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in regulatory enforcement, litigation and potential liability for Dell Technologies, damage Dell Technologies' brand and reputation, or otherwise harm Dell Technologies' business.  Further, Dell Technologies relies in certain limited capacities on third-party data management providers and other vendors whose possible security problems and security vulnerabilities may have similar effects on Dell Technologies.. Dell Technologies is subject to laws, rules, and regulations in the United States and other countries relating to the collection, use, and security of user and other data.  Dell Technologies' ability to execute transactions and to possess and use personal information and data in conducting its business subjects it to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require Dell Technologies to notify regulators and customers, employees, or other individuals of a data security breach, including in the European Union when the EU General Data Protection Regulation takes effect in May 2018.  Dell Technologies has incurred, and will continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards, or contractual obligations, but despite such expenditures may face regulatory and other legal actions in the event of a data breach or perceived or actual non-compliance with such requirements.. 21. Table of Contents. Failure to hedge effectively Dell Technologies' exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could adversely affect Dell Technologies' financial condition and results of operations.. Dell Technologies utilizes derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.  Some of these instruments and contracts may involve elements of market and credit risk in excess of the amounts recognized in Dell Technologies' financial statements.  If Dell Technologies is not successful in monitoring its foreign exchange exposures and conducting an effective hedging program, Dell Technologies' foreign currency hedging activities may not offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its future results of operations and financial position.. The expiration of tax holidays or favorable tax rate structures, unfavorable outcomes in tax audits and other tax compliance matters, or adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes could result in an increase in Dell Technologies' tax expense or Dell Technologies' effective income tax rate.. Portions of Dell Technologies' operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays that expire in whole or in part from time to time.  Many of these holidays may be extended when certain conditions are met, or may be terminated if certain conditions are not met.  If the tax holidays are not extended, or if Dell Technologies fails to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate, its effective tax rate would be impacted.  Dell Technologies' effective tax rate also could be impacted if Dell Technologies' geographic sales mix changes.  In addition, any actions by Dell Technologies to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which it has not previously provided for U.S. taxes may affect the effective tax rate.. The application of tax laws to Dell Technologies' operations and past transactions involves some inherent uncertainty.  Dell Technologies is continually under audit in various tax jurisdictions.  Although Dell Technologies believes its tax positions are appropriate, Dell Technologies may not be successful in resolving potential tax claims that arise from these audits.  An unfavorable outcome in certain of these matters could result in a substantial increase in Dell Technologies' tax expense.  In addition, Dell Technologies' provision for income taxes could be affected by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets.. Changes in tax laws (including any future Treasury notices or regulations related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017) could adversely affect Dell Technologies' operations and profitability.  In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial, and administrative changes have been made to tax laws applicable to Dell Technologies and companies similar to Dell Technologies.  Additional changes to tax laws are likely to occur, and such changes may adversely affect Dell Technologies' tax liability.. Dell Technologies' profitability could suffer from any impairment of its portfolio investments.. Dell Technologies invests a significant portion of its available funds in a portfolio consisting primarily of debt securities of various types and maturities pending the deployment of these funds in Dell Technologies' business.  Dell Technologies' earnings performance could suffer from any impairment of its investments.  Dell Technologies' portfolio securities generally are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded in Dell Technologies' financial statements at fair value.  If any such investments experience declines in market price and it is determined that such declines are other than temporary, Dell Technologies may have to recognize in earnings the decline in the fair market value of such investments below their cost or carrying value.. Unfavorable results of legal proceedings could harm Dell Technologies' business and result in substantial costs.. Dell Technologies is involved in various claims, suits, investigations, and legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business, as well as those that arose in connection with Dell's going-private transaction and the EMC merger transaction, including those described elsewhere in this report.  Additional legal claims or regulatory matters may arise in the future and could involve stockholder, consumer, regulatory, compliance, intellectual property, antitrust, tax, and other issues on a global basis.  Litigation is inherently unpredictable.  Regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to Dell Technologies' business.  Dell Technologies could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could adversely affect its operating results or cash flows in a particular period.  In addition, Dell Technologies' business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against it by any third party is successful, or if Dell Technologies fails to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions.. 22. Table of Contents. Dell Technologies is incurring increased costs and is subject to additional regulations and requirements as a public company, and Dell Technologies' management is required to devote substantial time to compliance matters, which could lower Dell Technologies' profits or make it more difficult to run its business.. Since it became a public company in June 2016, Dell Technologies has been incurring significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that it had not incurred as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements and costs of recruiting and retaining non-executive directors.  Dell Technologies also is incurring costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules implemented by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\"), on which its Class V Common Stock is listed.  The expenses incurred by public companies generally for financial reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing.  The increased Dell Technologies' legal and financial compliance costs have made some activities more time-consuming and costly.  Dell Technologies' management has to devote substantial time to ensuring that it complies with all of these requirements.  Laws and regulations affecting public company directors and executive officers could make it more difficult for Dell Technologies to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on its board of directors or its board committees or as its executive officers.  Further, if Dell Technologies is unable to satisfy its obligations as a public company, the Class V Common Stock could be subject to delisting from the NYSE and Dell Technologies could be subject to fines, sanctions, and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.. Dell Technologies is obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting and any failure to do so may adversely affect investor confidence in Dell Technologies and, as a result, the value of the Class V Common Stock.. Dell Technologies is required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to furnish an annual report by management on, among other matters, its assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting.  The assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by Dell Technologies' management in its report.  Dell Technologies also is required to disclose significant changes made in its internal control over financial reporting.  In addition, Dell Technologies' independent registered public accounting firm is required to express an opinion each year as to the effectiveness of Dell Technologies' internal control over financial reporting.  The process of designing, implementing, and testing internal control over financial reporting is time-consuming, costly, and complicated.. During the evaluation and testing process of its internal controls, if Dell Technologies identifies one or more material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, Dell Technologies will be unable to assert that its internal control over financial reporting is effective.  Dell Technologies may experience material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting in the future.  Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit Dell Technologies' ability to issue accurate reports of its financial condition or results of operations.  If Dell Technologies is unable to conclude that its internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if Dell Technologies' independent registered public accounting firm determines that Dell Technologies has a material weakness or significant deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of Dell Technologies' financial reports, the market price of the Class V Common Stock could decline, and Dell Technologies could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities.  Failure to remedy any material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, also could restrict future access to the capital markets by Dell Technologies or its subsidiaries.. Compliance requirements of current or future environmental and safety laws, or other laws, may increase costs, expose Dell Technologies to potential liability and otherwise harm Dell Technologies' business.. Dell Technologies' operations are subject to environmental and safety regulations in all areas in which Dell Technologies conducts business.  Product design and procurement operations must comply with new and future requirements relating to climate change laws and regulations, materials composition, sourcing, energy efficiency and collection, recycling, treatment, transportation, and disposal of electronics products, including restrictions on mercury, lead, cadmium, lithium metal, lithium ion, and other substances.  If Dell Technologies fails to comply with applicable rules and regulations regarding the transportation, source, use, and sale of such regulated substances, Dell Technologies could be subject to liability.  The costs and timing of costs under environmental and safety laws are difficult to predict, but could have an adverse impact on Dell Technologies' business.. In addition, Dell Technologies and its subsidiaries are subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and are also subject to export controls, customs, and economic sanctions laws and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government.  Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other anti-corruption laws or export control, customs, or economic sanctions laws may. 23. Table of Contents. result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, and Dell Technologies and its subsidiaries may be subject to other liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on their business, results of operations, and financial condition.. Dell Technologies also is subject to provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act intended to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries.  Dell Technologies will incur costs to comply with the disclosure requirements of this law and may realize other costs relating to the sourcing and availability of minerals used in Dell Technologies' products.  Further, Dell Technologies may face reputational harm if its customers or other Dell Technologies stakeholders conclude that Dell Technologies is unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals used in its products.. Armed hostilities, terrorism, natural disasters, or public health issues could harm Dell Technologies' business.. Armed hostilities, terrorism, natural disasters, or public health issues, whether in the United States or abroad, could cause damage or disruption to Dell Technologies or Dell Technologies' suppliers and customers, or could create political or economic instability, any of which could harm Dell Technologies' business.  For example, the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and severe flooding in Thailand which occurred during fiscal year 2012 caused damage to infrastructure and factories that disrupted the supply chain for a variety of components used in Dell's products.  Any such future events could cause a decrease in demand for Dell Technologies' products, make it difficult or impossible to deliver products or for suppliers to deliver components, and create delays and inefficiencies in Dell Technologies' supply chain.. Dell Technologies is highly dependent on the services of Michael S. Dell, its Chief Executive Officer, and its success depends on the ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees.. Dell Technologies is highly dependent on the services of Michael S. Dell, its Chief Executive Officer and largest stockholder.  If Dell Technologies loses the services of Mr. Dell, Dell Technologies may not be able to locate a suitable or qualified replacement, and Dell Technologies may incur additional expenses to recruit a replacement, which could severely disrupt Dell Technologies' business and growth.  Further, Dell Technologies relies on key personnel, including other members of its executive leadership team, to support its business and increasingly complex product and services offerings.  Dell Technologies may not be able to attract, retain, and motivate the key professional, technical, marketing, and staff resources needed.. Dell Technologies' substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect its financial condition.. Dell Technologies and its subsidiaries have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which require significant interest and other debt service payments.  As of February 2, 2018, Dell Technologies and its subsidiaries had approximately $51.9 billion of short-term and long-term indebtedness.  As of the same date, Dell Technologies and its subsidiaries also had an additional $4.9 billion available for borrowing under its revolving credit facilities.. Dell Technologies' substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:. • Dell Technologies must use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on its senior credit facilities, its senior secured and senior unsecured notes, and its other indebtedness, which reduces funds available to Dell Technologies for other purposes such as working capital, capital expenditures, other general corporate purposes, and potential acquisitions;. • Dell Technologies' ability to refinance such indebtedness or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes may be impaired;. • Dell Technologies is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates because Dell Technologies' senior credit facilities have variable rates of interest;. • Dell Technologies' leverage may be greater than that of some of its competitors, which may put Dell Technologies at a competitive disadvantage and reduce Dell Technologies' flexibility in responding to current and changing industry and financial market conditions; and. • Dell Technologies may be unable to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants in its senior credit facilities, the notes, and other indebtedness that limit Dell Technologies' ability to incur additional debt, make investments, and sell assets, which could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, would have an adverse effect on Dell Technologies' business and prospects and could force it into bankruptcy or liquidation.. 24. Table of Contents. Dell Technologies and its subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in Dell Technologies' and its subsidiaries' credit facilities and the indentures that govern the notes.  If new indebtedness is added to the debt levels of Dell Technologies and its subsidiaries, the related risks that Dell Technologies now faces could intensify.  Dell Technologies' ability to access additional funding under its revolving credit facilities will depend upon, among other factors, the absence of a default under either such facility, including any default arising from a failure to comply with the related covenants.  If Dell Technologies is unable to comply with its covenants under its revolving credit facilities, Dell Technologies' liquidity may be adversely affected.. From time to time, when it believes it is advantageous to do so, Dell Technologies may seek to reduce its leverage by repaying certain of its indebtedness before the maturity dates of such indebtedness.   Dell Technologies may be unable to generate operating cash flows and other cash necessary to achieve a level of debt reduction that will significantly enhance the company's credit quality and reduce the risks associated with its substantial indebtedness.. As of February 2, 2018, approximately $12.6 billion of Dell Technologies' debt was variable-rate debt and a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an increase of approximately $126 million in annual interest expense on such debt.  Dell Technologies' ability to meet its expenses, to remain in compliance with its covenants under its debt instruments and to make future principal and interest payments in respect of its debt depends on, among other factors, Dell Technologies' operating performance, competitive developments, and financial market conditions, all of which are significantly affected by financial, business, economic, and other factors.  Dell Technologies is not able to control many of these factors.  Given current industry and economic conditions, Dell Technologies' cash flow may not be sufficient to allow Dell Technologies to pay principal and interest on its debt and meet its other obligations.. The financial performance of Dell Technologies is affected by the financial performance of VMware, Inc... Because Dell Technologies consolidates the financial results of VMware, Inc. in its results of operations, its financial performance is affected by the financial performance of VMware, Inc.  VMware, Inc.'s financial performance may be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:. • fluctuations in demand, adoption rates, sales cycles (which have been increasing in length), and pricing levels for VMware, Inc.'s products and services;. • changes in customers' budgets for information technology purchases and in the timing of its purchasing decisions;. • the timing of recognizing revenues in any given quarter, which can be affected by a number of factors, including product announcements, beta programs, and product promotions that can cause revenue recognition of certain orders to be deferred until future products to which customers are entitled become available;. • the timing of announcements or releases of new or upgraded products and services by VMware, Inc. or by its competitors;. • the timing and size of business realignment plans and restructuring charges;. • VMware, Inc.'s ability to maintain scalable internal systems for reporting, order processing, license fulfillment, product delivery, purchasing, billing, and general accounting, among other functions;. • VMware, Inc.'s ability to control costs, including its operating expenses;. • credit risks of VMware, Inc.'s distributors, who account for a significant portion of VMware, Inc.'s product revenues and accounts receivable;. • VMware, Inc.'s ability to process sales at the end of the quarter;. • seasonal factors, such as the end of fiscal period budget expenditures by VMware, Inc.'s customers and the timing of holiday and vacation periods;. • renewal rates and the amounts of the renewals for enterprise agreements, as the original terms of such agreements expire;. 25. Table of Contents. • the timing and amount of software development costs that may be capitalized;. • unplanned events that could affect market perception of the quality or cost-effectiveness of VMware, Inc.'s products and solutions; and. • VMware, Inc.'s ability to predict accurately the degree to which customers will elect to purchase its subscription-based offerings in place of licenses to its on-premises offerings.. Dell Technologies' pension plan assets are subject to market volatility.. Through the EMC merger transaction, Dell Technologies assumed a noncontributory defined pension plan, which was originally part of the EMC legacy acquisition of Data General.  The plan's assets are invested in common stocks, bonds, and cash.  As of February 2, 2018 the expected long-term rate of return on the plan's assets was 6.5%, which represented the average of the expected long-term rates of return weighted by the plan's assets as of February 2, 2018.  As market conditions permit, Dell Technologies expects to continue to shift the asset allocation to lower the percentage of investments in equities and increase the percentage of investments in long-duration fixed-income securities.  The effect of such a change could result in a reduction in the long-term rate of return on plan assets and an increase in future pension expense.  As of February 2, 2018, the ten-year historical rate of return on plan assets was 7.38%, and the inception-to-date return on plan assets was 9.74%.  Should Dell Technologies not achieve the expected rate of return on the plan's assets or if the plan experiences a decline in the fair value of its assets, Dell Technologies may be required to contribute assets to the plan, which could materially adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition.. Risk Factors Relating to Ownership of Dell Technologies. The MD stockholders and the SLP stockholders have the ability to elect all of the directors of Dell Technologies, and such stockholders' interests may differ from the interests of the holders of Class V Common Stock.. By reason of their ownership of substantially all of Dell Technologies' Class A Common Stock, Michael S. Dell and a separate property trust for the benefit of his wife (the \"MD stockholders\") have the ability to elect all of the Group I Directors, who have an aggregate of 3 of the 13 total votes on the Dell Technologies board of directors, and all of the Group II Directors, who have an aggregate of 7 of the 13 total votes on the Dell Technologies board of directors.  By reason of their ownership of all of the Class B Common Stock, investment funds affiliated with Silver Lake Partners (the \"SLP stockholders\") have the ability to elect all of the Group III Directors, who have an aggregate of 3 of the 13 total votes on the Dell Technologies board of directors.  Michael S. Dell is the sole Group II Director and therefore is entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by all Dell Technologies directors and thereby approve any matter submitted to the Dell Technologies board of directors other than any matter that also requires the separate approval of the Capital Stock Committee or the audit committee.  Egon Durban and Simon Patterson are the sole Group III Directors.  Dell Technologies' directors owe fiduciary duties to Dell Technologies as a whole and to all of Dell Technologies' stockholders and not just to holders of a particular class of shares.. Dell Technologies is controlled by the MD stockholders and the SLP stockholders, whose interests may differ from the interests of the holders of Class V Common Stock.. By reason of their ownership of Class A Common Stock possessing a majority of the aggregate votes entitled to be cast by holders of Dell Technologies' Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock, Class C Common Stock, and Class V Common Stock, voting together as a single class, the MD stockholders have the ability to approve any matter submitted to the vote of all of the outstanding shares of Dell Technologies common stock voting together as a single class.. Through their control of Dell Technologies, subject to certain special voting rights of the Class V Common Stock related to actions that affect the Class V Common Stock and certain consent rights of the SLP stockholders, the MD stockholders and the MSD Partners stockholders are able to control actions to be taken by Dell Technologies, including the election of directors of Dell Technologies' subsidiaries (including VMware, Inc. and its subsidiaries), amendments to Dell Technologies' organizational documents and the approval of significant corporate transactions, including mergers, sales of substantially all of Dell Technologies' assets, distributions of Dell Technologies' assets, the incurrence of indebtedness, and any incurrence of liens on Dell Technologies' assets.. 26. Table of Contents. The Dell Technologies board of directors has formed an executive committee of the board consisting entirely of directors designated by the MD stockholders and the SLP stockholders, and has delegated a substantial portion of the power and authority of the Dell Technologies board of directors to the executive committee.. The Dell Technologies board of directors has formed an executive committee of the board consisting entirely of Group II Directors and Group III Directors (none of whom are independent directors under NYSE rules), and has delegated a substantial portion of the power and authority of the Dell Technologies board of directors to the executive committee.  Among other matters, the executive committee has been delegated the board's power and authority, subject to specified limits, to review and approve, with respect to Dell Technologies and its subsidiaries, acquisitions and dispositions, the annual budget and business plan, the incurrence of indebtedness, entry into material commercial agreements, joint ventures and strategic alliances, and the commencement and settlement of material litigation.  In addition, the executive committee acts as the compensation committee of Dell Technologies' board of directors.  The interests of the MD stockholders, who have the ability to elect all of the Group II Directors, and the SLP stockholders, who have the ability to elect all of the Group III Directors may differ materially from the interests of the holders of Class V Common Stock and Dell Technologies' other stakeholders.. The MD stockholders and the SLP stockholders will be able to continue to strongly influence or effectively control decisions made by the Dell Technologies board of directors even if they own less than 50% of Dell Technologies' combined voting power.. So long as the MD stockholders and the SLP stockholders continue to own a significant amount of Dell Technologies' combined voting power, even if such amount is less than 50%, they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control decisions made by the Dell Technologies board of directors.  For example, before an initial public offering of DHI Group Common Stock, so long as the MD stockholders and the SLP stockholders each continue to beneficially own an aggregate number of shares of DHI Group Common Stock equal to 9,818,182 or more shares of DHI Group Common Stock, as adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split, or similar event, they will be jointly entitled to nominate for election as directors up to three Group I Directors, the MD stockholders will be entitled to nominate for election as directors up to three Group II Directors, and the SLP stockholders will be entitled to nominate for election as directors up to three Group III Directors.  Following an initial public offering of DHI Group Common Stock, so long as each of the MD stockholders and the SLP stockholders beneficially own at least 5% of all outstanding shares of Dell Technologies stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, each of the MD stockholders and the SLP stockholders will be entitled to nominate at least one individual for election to the board, with each of the MD stockholders and the SLP stockholders having the right to nominate a number of directors equal to the percentage of the total voting power for the regular election of directors of Dell Technologies beneficially owned by the MD stockholders or by the SLP stockholders, as the case may be, multiplied by the number of directors then on the Dell Technologies board.. The MD Stockholders, the MSD Partners stockholders, and the SLP stockholders and their respective affiliates may have interests that conflict with the interests of other stockholders or those of Dell Technologies.. In the ordinary course of their business activities, the MD stockholders, investment funds affiliated with MSD Partners, L.P. (the \"MSD Partners stockholders\"), and the SLP stockholders and their respective affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with interests of other stockholders or those of the company.  The Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation provides that none of the MD stockholders, the MSD Partners stockholders, and the SLP stockholders, any of their respective affiliates or any director who is not employed by Dell Technologies (including any non-employee director who serves as one of Dell Technologies' officers in both his director and officer capacities) or his or her affiliates have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which Dell Technologies operates.  The MD stockholders, the MSD Partners stockholders, and the SLP stockholders also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to Dell Technologies' business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to Dell Technologies.  In addition, such stockholders may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance the value of their investment in Dell Technologies, even though such transactions might involve risks to other stockholders.. Dell Technologies is a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of NYSE rules and, as a result, qualifies for, and relies on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements, as a result of which holders of Class V Common Stock do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.. As of February 2, 2018, for any matter submitted to a vote of the holders of Dell Technologies common stock voting together as a single class:. 27. Table of Contents. • the number of votes to which holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled represent approximately 72% of the total number of votes to which all holders of Dell Technologies common stock are entitled;. • the number of votes to which holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled represent approximately 24% of the total number of votes to which all holders of Dell Technologies common stock are entitled;. • the number of votes to which holders of Class C Common Stock are entitled represent less than 1% of the total number of votes to which all holders of Dell Technologies common stock are entitled; and. • the number of votes to which holders of Class V Common Stock are entitled represent approximately 4% of the total number of votes to which all holders of Dell Technologies common stock are entitled.. Accordingly, the MD stockholders and the SLP stockholders control a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of Dell Technologies stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.. Dell Technologies is a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of NYSE rules.  Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power in the election of directors is held by an individual, group, or another company is a \"controlled company\" and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:. • Dell Technologies have a board that is composed of a majority of \"independent directors,\" as defined under the rules of the NYSE;. • Dell Technologies have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and. • Dell Technologies have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.. Dell Technologies is utilizing these exemptions.  As a result, a majority of the directors on the Dell Technologies board of directors are not independent directors and none of the committees of the Dell Technologies board of directors consists entirely of independent directors, other than the audit committee and the Capital Stock Committee.  Accordingly, holders of Class V Common Stock do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.. The Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation designates a state court of the State of Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by Dell Technologies' stockholders, which could limit the ability of the holders of Class V Common Stock to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with Dell Technologies or with directors, officers, or the controlling stockholders of Dell Technologies.. Under the Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation, unless Dell Technologies consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum will be a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) for:. • any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of Dell Technologies;. • any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or stockholder of Dell Technologies to Dell Technologies or Dell Technologies' stockholders;. • any action asserting a claim against Dell Technologies or any director or officer or stockholder of Dell Technologies arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or Dell Technologies' certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or. • any action asserting a claim against Dell Technologies or any director or officer or stockholder of Dell Technologies governed by the internal affairs doctrine.. These provisions of the Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation could limit the ability of the holders of the Class V Common Stock to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with Dell Technologies or with directors, officers, or the controlling stockholders of Dell Technologies, which may discourage such lawsuits against Dell Technologies and its directors,. 28. Table of Contents. officers, and stockholders.  Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of its constituent documents inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, Dell Technologies may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations.. Risk Factors Relating to the Class V Common Stock. Holders of Class V Common Stock are common stockholders of Dell Technologies and, therefore, are subject to risks associated with an investment in Dell Technologies as a whole.. Even though Dell Technologies attributes, for financial reporting purposes, all of Dell Technologies' consolidated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses to either the DHI Group or the Class V Group in order to determine the DHI Group and Class V Common Stock earnings and earnings per share and to prepare the unaudited financial information for the Class V Group, Dell Technologies retains legal title to all of Dell Technologies' assets, and Dell Technologies' tracking stock capitalization does not limit Dell Technologies' legal responsibility, or that of Dell Technologies' subsidiaries, for their debts and liabilities.  The DHI Group generally refers to the direct and indirect interest of Dell Technologies in all of Dell Technologies' business, assets, properties, liabilities, and preferred stock other than those attributable to the Class V Group, as well as the DHI Group's retained interest in the Class V Group equal to approximately 39% of Dell Technologies' economic interest in the Class V Group as of February 2, 2018.  The Class V Common Stock is intended to track the economic performance of approximately 61% of Dell Technologies' economic interest in the Class V Group as of February 2, 2018.  The Class V Group consists solely of VMware, Inc. common stock held by Dell Technologies.  As of February 2, 2018, the Class V Group consisted of approximately 331 million shares of VMware, Inc. common stock.. Although Dell Technologies' tracking stock policy provides that reallocations of assets between groups may result in the creation of inter-group debt or an increase or decrease of the DHI Group's inter-group interest in the Class V Group or in an offsetting reallocation of cash or other assets, Dell Technologies' creditors are not limited by Dell Technologies' tracking stock capitalization from proceeding against any assets against which they could have proceeded if Dell Technologies did not have a tracking stock capitalization.  The DHI Group and the Class V Group are not separate legal entities and cannot own assets, and, as a result, holders of Class V Common Stock do not have special legal rights related to specific assets attributed to the Class V Group and, in any liquidation, holders of DHI Group Common Stock and holders of Class V Common Stock will be entitled to their proportionate interests in assets of Dell Technologies after payment or provision for payment of the debts and liabilities of Dell Technologies and payment or provision for payment of any preferential amount due to the holders of any other class or series of stock based on their respective numbers of liquidation units.. The Dell Technologies board of directors may not reallocate assets and liabilities between the DHI Group and the Class V Group without the approval of the Capital Stock Committee, which currently consists solely of independent directors, but any such reallocation of assets and liabilities may make it difficult to assess the future prospects of either group based on its past performance.. The Dell Technologies board of directors may not allocate or reallocate assets and liabilities to one group or the other without the approval of the Capital Stock Committee, which must consist of a majority of independent directors and currently consists solely of independent directors.  Any such allocation or reallocation may be made without the approval of any of Dell Technologies' stockholders in accordance with the Dell Technologies tracking stock policy and the Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation.  Any such reallocation made by the Dell Technologies board of directors, as well as the existence of the right in and of itself to effect a reallocation, may affect the ability of investors to assess the future prospects of either group, including its liquidity and capital resource needs, based on its past performance.  Stockholders also may have difficulty evaluating the liquidity and capital resources of each group based on past performance, as the Dell Technologies board of directors may use one group's liquidity to fund the other group's liquidity and capital expenditure requirements through the use of inter-group loans or other inter-group arrangements.. Any allocation or reallocation of assets and liabilities to one group or the other that results in the Class V Common Stock ceasing to track the performance of the Class A common stock of VMware, Inc. could result in the delisting of the Class V Common Stock from the NYSE, as discussed below, which would materially adversely affect the liquidity and value of the Class V Common Stock.. The listing standards of the NYSE include certain requirements to maintain the listing of an Equity Investment Tracking Stock, and if the Class V Common Stock were delisted because of the failure to meet any of such requirements, the liquidity and value of the Class V Common Stock would be materially adversely affected.. 29. Table of Contents. The NYSE has listing standards for a tracking stock, which the NYSE refers to as an \"Equity Investment Tracking Stock,\" that tracks the performance of an investment by the issuer in the common equity of another company listed on the NYSE, such as VMware, Inc.  The listing standards of the NYSE provide that the Class V Common Stock could be delisted from the NYSE if:. • the Class A common stock of VMware, Inc. ceases to be listed on the NYSE;. • Dell Technologies ceases to own, directly or indirectly, at least 50% of either the economic interest or the voting power of all of the outstanding classes of common equity of VMware, Inc.; or. • the Class V Common Stock ceases to track the performance of the Class A common stock of VMware, Inc.. If any of the foregoing conditions were no longer met at any time, the NYSE would determine whether the Class V Common Stock could meet any other applicable initial listing standard in place at that time.  If the Class V Common Stock did not qualify for initial listing at that time under another applicable listing standard, the NYSE would commence delisting proceedings.  Further, if trading in the Class A common stock of VMware, Inc. were suspended or delisting proceedings were commenced with respect to such Class A common stock, trading in the Class V Common Stock would be suspended or delisting proceedings would be commenced with respect to the Class V Common Stock at the same time.  Any delisting of the Class V Common Stock would materially adversely affect the liquidity and value of the Class V Common Stock.. The market price of Class V Common Stock may not reflect the performance of the Class V Group as Dell Technologies intends.. The market price of the Class V Common Stock may not reflect the performance of Dell Technologies' interest in VMware, Inc. and any other businesses, assets, and liabilities that may be attributed to the Class V Group at any time.  Holders of Class V Common Stock are common stockholders of Dell Technologies as a whole and, as such, are subject to all risks associated with an investment in Dell Technologies and all of Dell Technologies' businesses, assets, and liabilities, including the approximately $51.9 billion of short-term and long-term indebtedness that Dell Technologies has outstanding as of February 2, 2018.  In addition, investors may discount the value of the Class V Common Stock because it is part of a common enterprise rather than of a stand-alone entity.  As a result of the characteristics of tracking stocks, tracking stocks often trade at a discount to the estimated value of the assets or businesses they are intended to track.. The market price of Class V Common Stock may be volatile, could fluctuate substantially, and could be affected by factors that do not affect traditional common stock.. The market price of Class V Common Stock may be materially affected by, among other factors:. • actual or anticipated fluctuations in VMware, Inc.'s operating results or in the operating results of any other businesses attributable to the Class V Group from time to time;. • potential acquisition activity by Dell Technologies or the companies in which Dell Technologies invests;. • adverse changes in the credit rating or credit quality of Dell Technologies and its subsidiaries;. • issuances of additional debt or equity securities to raise capital by Dell Technologies or the companies in which Dell Technologies invests and the manner in which that debt or the proceeds of an equity issuance are attributed to each of the groups;. • changes in financial estimates by securities analysts regarding Class V Common Stock or the companies attributable to either of Dell Technologies' groups;. • changes in market valuations of other companies engaged in similar lines of business;. • the complex nature and the potential difficulties investors may have in understanding the terms of the Class V Common Stock, as well as concerns regarding the possible effect of certain of those terms on an investment in Dell Technologies' stock; and. • general market conditions.. 30. Table of Contents. The market price of Class V Common Stock may fluctuate significantly as a result of these and other factors.  The market price of the Class V Common Stock may decline from time to time and you may not be able to sell your shares of Class V Common Stock at an attractive price or at all.. Dell Technologies may not pay dividends equally or at all on the Class V Common Stock.. VMware, Inc. does not currently pay dividends on its common stock, and any decisions regarding dividends on the VMware, Inc. common stock would be a decision of VMware, Inc.'s board of directors.  Dell Technologies does not presently intend to pay cash dividends on the Class V Common Stock.  If VMware, Inc. were to pay a dividend on the VMware, Inc. common stock owned by Dell Technologies that is attributable to the Class V Group, Dell Technologies could, but would not be required to, distribute some or all of that amount to the holders of Class V Common Stock.  Dell Technologies has the right to pay dividends on the shares of common stock of each group in equal or unequal amounts, and Dell Technologies may pay dividends on the shares of common stock of one group and not pay dividends on shares of common stock of the other group.  In addition, any dividends or distributions on, or repurchases of, shares relating to either group will reduce Dell Technologies' assets legally available to be paid as dividends on the shares relating to the other group.. Dell Technologies' operations are conducted almost entirely through its subsidiaries and its ability to generate cash to make future dividend payments, if any, is highly dependent on the cash flows and the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries via dividends or intercompany loans.  To the extent that Dell Technologies determines in the future to pay dividends on the DHI Group Common Stock or the Class V Common Stock, the terms of certain agreements governing Dell Technologies' or its subsidiaries' indebtedness, including the revolving credit facilities of Dell Technologies and any credit facilities of VMware, Inc., may significantly restrict the ability of Dell Technologies' subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer assets to Dell Technologies, as well as the ability of Dell Technologies to pay dividends to holders of its common stock.  In addition, Delaware law imposes requirements that may restrict Dell Technologies' ability to pay dividends to holders of its common stock.. Dell Technologies' tracking stock capital structure could create conflicts of interest, and the Dell Technologies board of directors might make decisions that could adversely affect only some holders of Dell Technologies' common stock.. Dell Technologies' tracking stock capital structure could give rise to circumstances in which the interests of holders of stock of one group might diverge or appear to diverge from the interests of holders of stock of the other group.  In addition, given the nature of their businesses, there may be inherent conflicts of interests between the DHI Group and the Class V Group.  Dell Technologies' groups are not separate entities and thus holders of DHI Group Common Stock and Class V Common Stock do not have the right to elect separate boards of directors.  As a result, Dell Technologies' officers and directors owe fiduciary duties to Dell Technologies as a whole and all of Dell Technologies' stockholders as opposed to only holders of a particular group.  Decisions deemed to be in the best interest of Dell Technologies and all of Dell Technologies' stockholders may not be in the best interest of a particular group when considered independently, such as:. • decisions as to the terms of any business relationships that may be created between the DHI Group and the Class V Group or the terms of any reallocations of assets between the groups;. • decisions as to the allocation of corporate opportunities between the groups, especially where the opportunities might meet the strategic business objectives of both groups;. • decisions as to operational and financial matters that could be considered detrimental to one group but beneficial to the other;. • decisions as to the conversion of Class V Common Stock into Class C Common Stock, which the Dell Technologies board of directors may make in its sole discretion, so long as the Class C Common Stock is then traded on a U.S. securities exchange;. • decisions regarding the increase or decrease of the inter-group interest that the DHI Group may own in the Class V Group from time to time;. • decisions as to the internal or external financing attributable to businesses or assets attributed to either of Dell Technologies' groups;. • decisions as to the dispositions of assets of either of Dell Technologies' groups; and. 31. Table of Contents. • decisions as to the payment of dividends on the stock relating to either of Dell Technologies' groups.. Ownership of DHI Group Common Stock and Class V Common Stock by Dell Technologies' directors or officers may create or appear to create conflicts of interest.. With the exception of the three independent directors who serve as Group I Directors (whose equity compensation by Dell Technologies must be approximately half in the form of Class V Common Stock or options to acquire Class V Common Stock based on value at the time of grant), it is expected that all or substantially all of the direct and indirect equity ownership in Dell Technologies of Dell Technologies' directors and officers will continue to consist of DHI Group Common Stock.  Such ownership of DHI Group Common Stock by Dell Technologies' directors and officers could create or appear to create conflicts of interest when they are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the holders of DHI Group Common Stock or Class V Common Stock.. The Dell Technologies board of directors may not change the Dell Technologies tracking stock policy without the approval of the Capital Stock Committee, which currently consists solely of independent directors, but any such change may be made to the detriment of either group without stockholder approval.. The Dell Technologies board of directors has adopted the Dell Technologies tracking stock policy described in this report to serve as guidelines in making decisions regarding the relationships between the DHI Group and the Class V Group with respect to matters such as tax liabilities and benefits, inter-group debt, inter-group interests, allocation and reallocation of assets, financing alternatives, corporate opportunities, payment of dividends, and similar items.  These policies also set forth the initial allocation of Dell Technologies' businesses, assets, and liabilities between the groups.  These policies are not included in the Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation.  The Dell Technologies board of directors may not change or make exceptions to these policies without the approval of the Capital Stock Committee, which must consist of a majority of independent directors and which currently consists solely of independent directors.  Because these policies relate to matters concerning the day-to-day management of Dell Technologies as opposed to significant corporate actions, such as a merger involving Dell Technologies or a sale of substantially all of Dell Technologies' assets, no stockholder approval is required with respect to their adoption or amendment.  A decision to change, or make exceptions to, these policies or adopt additional policies could disadvantage one group while conferring an advantage on the other.. Holders of shares of stock relating to a particular group may not have any remedies if any action by Dell Technologies' directors or officers has an adverse effect on only that stock.. Principles of Delaware law and the provisions of the Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation may protect decisions of the Dell Technologies board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of shares of stock relating to a particular group.  Under Delaware law, the Dell Technologies board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all stockholders.  Principles of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that, subject to any applicable provisions of the corporation's certificate of incorporation, a board of directors owes an equal duty to all stockholders and does not have separate or additional duties to holders of any class or series of stock.  Judicial opinions in Delaware involving tracking stocks have established that decisions by directors or officers involving differing treatment of holders of tracking stocks may be judged under the business judgment rule.  In some circumstances, Dell Technologies' directors or officers may be required to make a decision that is viewed as adverse to the holders of shares relating to a particular group.  Under the principles of Delaware law and the business judgment rule referred to above, Dell Technologies stockholders may not be able to successfully challenge decisions they believe have a disparate impact upon the stockholders of one of Dell Technologies' groups if a majority of the Dell Technologies board of directors is disinterested and independent with respect to the action taken, is adequately informed with respect to the action taken, and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that the Dell Technologies board of directors is acting in the best interests of Dell Technologies and all of Dell Technologies' stockholders.. Dell Technologies may dispose of assets of the Class V Group without the approval of holders of the Class V Common Stock.. Delaware law requires stockholder approval only for a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Dell Technologies taken as a whole, and the Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation does not require a separate class vote in the case of a sale of a significant amount of assets attributed to any of Dell Technologies' groups.  As long as the assets attributed to the Class V Group proposed to be disposed of represent less than substantially all of Dell Technologies' assets, Dell Technologies may approve sales and other dispositions of any amount of the assets attributed to such group without any stockholder approval.. 32. Table of Contents. If Dell Technologies disposes of all or substantially all of the assets attributed to the Class V Group (which means, for this purpose, assets representing 80% of the fair value of the total assets of the Class V Group as of such date, as determined by the Dell Technologies board of directors), Dell Technologies would be required, if the disposition is not an excluded transaction under the terms of the Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation, to choose one or more of the following three alternatives:. • declare and pay a dividend on the Class V Common Stock;. • redeem shares of the Class V Common Stock in exchange for cash, securities, or other property; or. • so long as the Class C Common Stock is then traded on a U.S. securities exchange, convert all or a portion of the outstanding Class V Common Stock into Class C Common Stock.. In this type of a transaction, holders of the Class V Common Stock may receive less value than the value that a third-party buyer might pay for all or substantially all of the assets of the Class V Group.. The Dell Technologies board of directors will decide, in its sole discretion, how to proceed and is not required to select the option that would result in the highest value to holders of any group of Dell Technologies' common stock.. Holders of Class V Common Stock may receive less consideration upon a sale of the assets attributed to the Class V Group than if such group were a separate company.. If the Class V Group were a separate, independent company and its shares were acquired by another person, certain costs of that sale, including corporate level taxes, might not be payable in connection with that acquisition.  As a result, stockholders of a separate, independent company with the same assets might receive a greater amount of proceeds than the holders of Class V Common Stock would receive upon a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Class V Group.  In addition, in the event of such a sale, the per share consideration to be paid to holders of Class V Common Stock may not be equal to or more than the per share value before or after the announcement of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Class V Group.  Further, there is no requirement that the consideration paid be tax-free to the holders of Class V Common Stock.  Accordingly, if Dell Technologies sells all or substantially all of the assets attributed to the Class V Group, the value of Dell Technologies' stockholders' investment in Dell Technologies could decrease.. In the event of a liquidation of Dell Technologies, holders of Class V Common Stock will not have a priority with respect to the assets attributed to the Class V Group remaining for distribution to stockholders.. Under the Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation, upon Dell Technologies' liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up, holders of the Class V Common Stock will be entitled to receive, in respect of their shares of such stock, their proportionate interest in all of Dell Technologies' assets, if any, remaining for distribution to holders of common stock in proportion to their respective number of \"liquidation units\" per share.  Relative liquidation units will be based on the volume-weighted average price of the Class V Common Stock over the period of ten trading days commencing shortly after the initial filing of the Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation and the determination of the Dell Technologies board of directors of the value of the DHI Group Common Stock at such time.  Hence, the assets to be distributed to a holder of Class V Common Stock upon a liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of Dell Technologies will not be linked to the relative value of the assets attributed to the Class V Group at that time or to changes in the relative value of the DHI Group Common Stock and the Class V Common Stock over time.. The Dell Technologies board of directors in its sole discretion may elect to convert the Class V Common Stock into Class C Common Stock, thereby changing the nature of the investment.. The Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation permits the Dell Technologies board of directors, in its sole discretion, to convert all of the outstanding shares of Class V Common Stock into Class C Common Stock at such time as the Class C Common Stock is already traded on a U.S. securities exchange and the shares are converted at a ratio that provides the holders of the Class V Common Stock with the applicable conversion premium to which they are entitled.  A conversion would preclude the holders of Class V Common Stock from retaining their investment in a security that is intended to reflect separately the performance of the Class V Group.  Dell Technologies cannot predict the impact on the market value of Dell Technologies' stock of (1) the Dell Technologies board of directors' ability to effect any such conversion or (2) the exercise of this conversion right by Dell Technologies.. 33. Table of Contents. If Dell Technologies exercises its option to convert all outstanding shares of Class V Common Stock into shares of Class C Common Stock, such conversion would effectively eliminate Dell Technologies' tracking stock structure because, upon conversion, the holders of Class V Common Stock would hold one of four series of DHI Group Common Stock, none of which, after such conversion, would be intended to track the performance of any distinct tracking groups.  Upon any such conversion, for example, holders would no longer have special class voting rights or be subject to certain redemption or conversion provisions related to the Class V Group.  In addition, there would no longer be a Capital Stock Committee or a tracking stock policy.. Holders of DHI Group Common Stock and Class V Common Stock generally vote together and holders of Class V Common Stock have limited separate voting rights.. Holders of DHI Group Common Stock and Class V Common Stock vote together as a single class, except in certain limited circumstances prescribed by the Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation and under Delaware law.  Each share of Class V Common Stock and Class C Common Stock has one vote per share.  Each share of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock has ten votes per share.  Holders of Class D Common Stock do not vote on any matters except to the extent required under Delaware law.  In addition, the Group II Directors are elected solely by the holders of Class A Common Stock voting as a separate class and the Group III Directors are elected solely by the holders of Class B Common Stock voting as a separate class.. As of February 2, 2018, the number of votes to which holders of Class V Common Stock are entitled represent approximately 4% of the total number of votes to which all holders of Dell Technologies common stock are entitled, the number of votes to which holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled represent approximately 72% of the total number of votes to which all holders of Dell Technologies common stock are entitled, the number of votes to which holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled represent approximately 24% of the total number of votes to which all holders of Dell Technologies common stock are entitled, and the number of votes to which holders of Class C Common Stock are entitled represent less than 1% of the total number of votes to which all holders of Dell Technologies common stock are entitled.  As a result, when holders of DHI Group Common Stock and Class V Common Stock vote together as a single class, holders of DHI Group Common Stock will be in a position to control the outcome of the vote even if the matter involves a conflict of interest among Dell Technologies' stockholders or has a greater impact on one group than the other.. Certain restrictions provided in the Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation will lapse on the two-year anniversary of the closing of the EMC merger transaction, which would allow Dell Technologies to cause VMware, Inc. Class A common stock to cease to be publicly listed and would prevent investors who may view the market price of VMware, Inc. Class A common stock as relevant to a valuation of the VMware business from accessing sale information.. Certain restrictions in the Dell Technologies, Inc. certificate of incorporation prohibit Dell Technologies from acquiring shares of VMware, Inc. common stock for two years after the closing of the EMC merger transaction in September 2016 in circumstances in which the VMware, Inc. Class A common stock would cease to be listed on a U.S. national securities exchange, subject to certain exceptions related to tax consolidation.  While investors may view the market price of VMware, Inc. Class A common stock as relevant to a valuation of the VMware business, the Class V Common Stock and the VMware, Inc. Class A common stock have different characteristics, which Dell Technologies believes may affect their respective market prices in distinct ways.  If Dell Technologies determined to take such actions following the expiration of such restrictions in the Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation and the VMware, Inc. Class A common stock ceased to trade publicly, such action could cause the Class V Common Stock to be delisted from the NYSE, as discussed above, which would materially adversely affect the liquidity and value of the Class V Common Stock.. Holders of Class V Common Stock may not benefit from any potential premiums paid to the public holders of VMware, Inc. Class A common stock.. Dell Technologies or other persons may choose to purchase shares of VMware, Inc. Class A common stock at a premium, and holders of Class V Common Stock would not be entitled to a similar premium for their shares of Class V Common Stock in such circumstances.. 34. Table of Contents. Dell Technologies' capital structure, as well as the fact that the Class V Group is not an independent company, may inhibit or prevent acquisition bids for the Class V Group and may make it difficult for a third party to acquire Dell Technologies, even if doing so may be beneficial to Dell Technologies' stockholders.. If the Class V Group were a separate, independent company, any person interested in acquiring the Class V Group without negotiating with management could seek control of the group by obtaining control of its outstanding voting stock by means of a tender offer or a proxy contest.  Although Dell Technologies intends the Class V Common Stock to reflect the separate economic performance of the Class V Group, the group is not a separate entity and a person interested in acquiring only the Class V Group without negotiation with Dell Technologies' management could obtain control of the group only by obtaining control of a majority in voting power of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Dell Technologies.  Even if the MD stockholders and the SLP stockholders approved such an acquisition, the existence of shares of common stock relating to different groups could present complexities and in certain circumstances pose obstacles, financial and otherwise, to an acquiring person that are not present in companies that do not have capital structures similar to the Dell Technologies capital structure.. Certain provisions of the Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation and the Dell Technologies bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of Dell Technologies that a stockholder may consider favorable.  These provisions include:. • limitations on who may call special meetings of stockholders;. • advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to the Dell Technologies board of directors and for proposals for other businesses; and. • the existence of authorized and unissued stock, including \"blank check\" preferred stock, which could be issued by the Dell Technologies board of directors without approval of the holders of Dell Technologies common stock to persons friendly to Dell Technologies' then-current management, thereby protecting the continuity of Dell Technologies' management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of Dell Technologies.. Further, as a Delaware corporation, Dell Technologies is subject to provisions of Delaware law that may deter a takeover attempt that its stockholders may find beneficial.  These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of Dell Technologies, including actions that its stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of its common stock, including the Class V Common Stock.  These provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for Dell Technologies' stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause Dell Technologies to take other corporate actions that may be desired by its stockholders.. The Dell Technologies board of directors is authorized to issue and designate shares of preferred stock in additional series without stockholder approval.. The Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation authorizes the Dell Technologies board of directors, without the approval of its stockholders, to issue 1 million shares of preferred stock, subject to limitations prescribed by applicable law, rules, and regulations and the provisions of the Dell Technologies certificate of incorporation, as shares of preferred stock in series, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences, and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof.  The powers, preferences, and rights of these additional series of preferred stock may be senior to or on parity with Dell Technologies' classes of common stock, including the Class V Common Stock, which may reduce the value of the Class V Common Stock.. Future sales, or the perception of future sales, by Dell Technologies or holders of Class V Common Stock in the public market could cause the market price for the Class V Common Stock to decline.. The sale of substantial amounts of shares of the Class V Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of the Class V Common Stock.  These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for Dell Technologies to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that it deems appropriate.. 35.
