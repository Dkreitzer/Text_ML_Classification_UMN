[1] "ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS. IN GENERAL. You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision concerning our securities.. If any of the following risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline substantially. This Annual Report also contains forward - looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward - looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See \"Forward Looking Statements\" under Item 7 of this report for a discussion of forward looking statements.. RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE WHOLESALE BUSINESS.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRegulation of Cigarette and Tobacco Products by the FDA May Negatively Impact Our Operations.. In 2009, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act was signed into law which granted the FDA the authority to regulate the production, distribution, and marketing of tobacco products in the United States. Specifically, the legislation established an FDA office to regulate changes to nicotine yields, chemicals, flavors, ingredients, and the labeling. 7. Table of Contents. used to produce and market tobacco products. The FDA office is financed through user fees paid by tobacco companies, which is passed on to wholesale distributors and end consumers in the form of higher costs.. To date, most of the regulatory and compliance burden related to this legislation has fallen upon product manufacturers. However, if the FDA were to impose new regulations impacting wholesale distributors that we are not able to comply with, we could face remedial actions such as fines, suspension of product distribution rights, and/or termination of operations. Further, if the FDA were to issue product bans or product restrictions, our future revenue stream could materially decrease. If any of these items were to occur, our results from operations, cash flow, business, and overall financial condition could be negatively impacted..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur Sales Volume Is Largely Dependent upon the Distribution of Cigarette Products, Which is a Declining Sales Category.. The distribution of cigarettes represents a significant portion of our business. During fiscal 2017, approximately 71% of our consolidated revenues came from the distribution of cigarettes which generated approximately 20% of our consolidated gross profit. Due to manufacturer price increases, restrictions on advertising and promotions, regulation, higher excise and other taxes, health concerns, smoking bans, and other factors, the demand for cigarettes may continue to decline.  If this occurs, our results from operations, cash flow, business, and overall financial condition could be negatively impacted..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Are Subject to Substantial Excise Taxes and If These Taxes Are Increased, Our Sales of Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Could Decline.. Cigarette and tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes. Significant increases in cigarette - related taxes and fees have been imposed by city, state, and federal governments in recent years. Further, the evolving regulatory responsibilities of the FDA are being funded by fees imposed on tobacco companies. These fees have been passed on to wholesale distributors and end consumers in the form of higher prices for cigarette and tobacco products.. Increases in excise taxes and fees imposed by the FDA may reduce the long - term demand for cigarette and tobacco products and/or result in a sales shift from higher margin premium cigarette and tobacco products to lower margin deep - discount brands, while at the same time increasing the Company's accounts receivable risk and inventory carrying costs. If any of these events were to occur, our results from operations, cash flow, liquidity position, and overall financial condition could be negatively impacted..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDivestiture and Consolidation Trends Within the Convenience Store Industry May Negatively Impact Our Operations.. Divestitures and consolidations within the convenience store industry reflect a trend that may result in customer losses for us if the acquiring entity is served by another wholesale distributor and we are unable to retain the business. If we were to lose a substantial volume of business because of these trends, our results from operations, cash flow, business, and overall financial condition could be negatively impacted..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tVolatility in Fuel Prices Could Reduce Profit Margins and Adversely Affect Our Business.. Increases or decreases in fuel prices can and do have an impact on our profit margins. If we are not able to meaningfully pass on these costs to customers, it could adversely impact our results of operations, business, cash flow, and financial condition..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe Wholesale Distribution of Convenience Store Products Is Significantly Affected by Pricing Decisions and Promotional Programs Offered by Manufacturers and State Taxing Authorities.. We receive payments from the manufacturers of the products we distribute including allowances, discounts, volume rebates, and other merchandising incentives in connection with various incentive programs. In addition, we receive discounts from states in connection with the purchase of excise stamps for cigarettes. If the manufacturers or states change or discontinue these programs or we are unable to maintain the volume of our sales, our results of operations, business,. 8. Table of Contents. cash flow, and financial condition could be negatively affected. There are no assurances that the manufacturers or states will maintain these programs..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCompetition Within The Wholesale Distribution Industry May Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business.. The wholesale distribution industry is highly competitive. There are many distribution companies operating in the same geographical regions as our Company. Our Company's principal competitors are national and regional wholesalers, along with a host of smaller grocery and tobacco wholesalers. Most of these competitors generally offer a wide range of products at prices comparable to those offered by our Company. Some of our competitors have substantial financial resources and long - standing customer relationships. This competition may reduce our margins and/or cause a loss in market share, adversely impacting our results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition. Most recently, Amazon entered the grocery and natural foods business with its acquisition of Whole Foods Market which enhances their competitive position in the food and grocery category posing a threat not only to food and grocery retailers, but also to wholesale distribution companies should they decide to compete in that portion of the industry's supply chain, including the distribution of products to convenience stores..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe Occasionally Purchase Cigarettes From Manufacturers Not Covered by The Tobacco Industry's Master Settlement Agreement (\"MSA\"), Which May Expose Us to Certain Potential Liabilities and Financial Risks for Which We Are Not Indemnified.. In 1994, the Mississippi attorney general brought an action against various tobacco industry members on behalf of the state to recover state funds paid for health - care costs related to tobacco use. Subsequently, most other states sued the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers based on similar theories. The cigarette manufacturer defendants settled the first four of these cases with Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota by separate agreements. These states are referred to as non - MSA states. In November 1998, the major U.S. tobacco product manufacturers entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories. The MSA and the other state settlement agreements settled health - care cost recovery actions and monetary claims relating to future conduct arising out of the use of, or exposure to, tobacco products, imposed a stream of future payment obligations on major U.S. cigarette manufacturers and placed significant restrictions on the ability to market and sell cigarettes. The payments required under the MSA resulted in the products sold by the participating manufacturers being priced at higher levels than the products sold by non - MSA manufacturers.. In order to limit our potential tobacco related liabilities, we try to limit our purchases of cigarettes from non - MSA manufacturers for sale in MSA states. The benefits of liability limitations and indemnities we are entitled to under the MSA do not apply to sales of cigarettes manufactured by non - MSA manufacturers. From time - to - time, however, we find it necessary to purchase a limited amount of cigarettes from non - MSA manufacturers. For example, during a transition period while integrating distribution operations from an acquisition we may need to purchase and distribute cigarettes manufactured by non - MSA manufacturers to satisfy the demands of customers of the acquired business. With respect to sales of such non - MSA cigarettes, we could be subject to litigation that could expose us to liabilities for which we would not be indemnified..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIf the Tobacco Industry's Master Settlement Agreement Is Invalidated, or Tobacco Manufacturers Cannot Meet Their Obligations to Indemnify Us, We Could Be Subject to Substantial Litigation Liability.. In connection with the MSA, we are indemnified by many of the tobacco product manufacturers from whom we purchase cigarettes and other tobacco products for liabilities arising from the sale of the tobacco products that they supply to us. However, if litigation challenging the validity of the MSA were to be successful and all or part of the MSA is invalidated, we could be subject to substantial litigation due to the sales of cigarettes and other tobacco products, and we may not be indemnified for such costs by the tobacco product manufacturers in the future. In addition, even if we continue to be indemnified by cigarette manufacturers that are parties to the MSA, future litigation awards against such cigarette manufacturers could be so large as to eliminate the ability of the manufacturers to satisfy their indemnification obligations. Our results of operations, business, cash flow, and overall financial condition could be negatively impacted due to increased litigation costs and potential adverse rulings against us.. 9. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe Face Competition From Sales of Deep - Discount Brands and Illicit and Other Low Priced Sales of Cigarettes.. Increased selling prices for cigarettes and higher cigarette taxes have resulted in the growth of deep - discount cigarette brands. Deep - discount cigarette brands are brands generally manufactured by companies that are not original participants to the MSA, and accordingly do not have cost structures burdened by the MSA. Since the MSA was signed, the category of deep - discount brands manufactured by smaller manufacturers or supplied by importers has grown substantially. If this growth continues, our results of operations, business cash flows, and overall financial condition would be negatively impacted.. RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE RETAIL BUSINESS.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIncreased Competition in the Retail Health Food Industry May Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business.. In our retail health food business, we compete with a wide range of well financed regional and national competitors such as Whole Foods Markets, Trader Joe's, Sprouts Farmers Market, Natural Grocers, Luck's Market, Fresh Thyme Farmers Market, General Nutrition Centers (\"GNC\"), and Vitamin World, and other online competitors such as Amazon all who have embarked on aggressive expansion strategies. Additionally, we compete with specialty supermarkets, other and independent natural foods stores chains, small specialty stores, and restaurants. Conventional supermarkets and mass market outlets such Krogers, Albertsons, Walmart, and Costco have also significantly increased their offerings of organic and natural products providing another layer of competition. Finally, if online shopping continues to grow in popularity and further disrupts traditional sales channels, it may present a significant direct risk to brick and mortar retailers. Most recently, Amazon entered the grocery and natural foods business with its acquisition of Whole Foods Market which enhances their competitive position in the food and grocery category posing a threat to all food and grocery retailers. Most of these competitors may have greater financial and marketing resources than our Company and may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting, and selling their products. In response to heightened competition, the Company is in the process of implementing a repositioning strategy for our retail business. This repositioning strategy calls for a wide range of initiatives including the possible addition of one or more of our new retail store prototypes per year into the foreseeable future. If our repositioning strategy in response to this increase in competition is not successful, it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business, cash flow, and financial condition, and could potentially result in the impairment of assets within this business segment..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in the Availability of Quality Natural and Organic Products Could Impact Our Business.. There is no assurance that quality natural and organic products including dietary supplements, fresh and processed foods and vitamins will be available to meet our stores future needs. If conventional supermarkets increase their natural and organic product offerings or if new laws require the reformulation of certain products to meet tougher standards, the supply of these products may be constrained. Any significant disruption in the supply of quality natural and organic products could have a material adverse impact on our overall sales and product costs..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPerishable Food Product Losses Could Materially Impact Our Results.. Our retail stores carry many perishable products which may result in significant product inventory losses in the event of extended power outages, natural disasters, or other catastrophic occurrences..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tA Reduction in Traffic to Anchor Stores in the Shopping Areas in Close Proximity to Our Stores Could Significantly Reduce Our Sales and Leave Us With Unsold Inventory, Which Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations.. Many of our stores are located in close proximity to shopping areas that also accommodate other well - known anchor stores. Sales at our stores are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic generated by the other anchor stores in the shopping areas where our stores are located. Customer traffic may be adversely affected by regional economic downturns, a general downturn in the local area where our store is located, long - term nearby road construction projects, the closing of nearby anchor stores or other nearby stores or the decline of the shopping environment in a particular shopping area. Any of these events would reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory, which could have a material adverse impact on our. 10. Table of Contents. business, financial condition, and results of operation. In response to such events, we may be required to increase markdowns or initiate marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory, which would further decrease our gross profits and net income..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIf We Are Unable to Successfully Identify Market Trends and React to Changing Consumer Preferences in a Timely Manner, Our Sales May Decrease.. We believe our success depends, in substantial part, on our ability to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tanticipate, identify and react to natural and organic grocery and dietary supplement trends and changing consumer preferences in a timely manner;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttranslate market trends into appropriate, saleable product and service offerings in our stores before our competitors; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelop and maintain vendor relationships that provide us access to the newest merchandise on reasonable terms.. If we are unable to anticipate and satisfy consumer merchandise preferences in the regions where we operate, our sales may decrease, and we may be forced to increase markdowns of slow - moving merchandise, either of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIf We or Our Third - Party Suppliers Fail to Comply With Regulatory Requirements, or are Unable to Provide Products that Meet Our Specifications, Our Business and Our Reputation Could be Negatively Impacted.. If we or our third - party suppliers, including suppliers of our private label products, fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or to meet our specifications for quality, we could be required to take costly corrective action and our reputation could be negatively impacted. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities, and therefore depend upon independent third - party vendors to produce our private label branded products, such as vitamins, minerals, dietary supplements, body care products, food products and bottled water. Third - party suppliers of our private label products may not maintain adequate controls with respect to product specifications and quality. Such suppliers may be unable to produce products on a timely basis or in a manner consistent with regulatory requirements. Additionally, there are no assurances that we would be successful in finding new third - party suppliers that meet our quality guidelines if needed. If any of these events were to occur, our results from operations, cash flow, liquidity position, and overall financial condition could be negatively impacted.. RISK FACTORS RELATED TO ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tEmployee Healthcare Benefits Represent a Significant Expense for Our Company and May Negatively Affect Our Profitability.. Healthcare represents a significant expense item for our Company and has been increasing in recent years similar to that of the general upward trend in healthcare costs nationwide. While we strive to control these costs through modifications to insurance coverage, including increasing co - pays and deductibles, there can be no assurance that we will be as successful in controlling such costs in the future. Continued increases in healthcare costs, as well as changes in laws, regulations, and assumptions used to calculate health and benefit expenses, may adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. In particular, changes mandated under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and its overall impact on the healthcare industry may increase our healthcare costs and negatively impact our cost structure, cash flow, profitability, and overall financial condition..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe May Be Subject to Product Liability Claims Which Could Adversely Affect Our Business.. We may face exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by us is alleged to cause injury or illness. With respect to product liability claims, we believe that we have sufficient liability insurance coverage and. 11. Table of Contents. indemnities from manufacturers. However, product liability insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost, or, if available, may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities. We generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying the products we sell, but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited, as a practical matter, to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insurance limits of any insurance provided by suppliers. If we do not have adequate insurance or if contractual indemnification is not available or if the counterparty cannot fulfill its indemnification obligation, product liability relating to allegedly defective products could materially adversely impact our results of operations, cash flow, business, and overall financial condition could be negatively impacted..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk Associated with Insurance Plans Claims. The Company uses a combination of insurance and self - insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers' compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers' liability insurance, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated by the Company, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other assumptions. Our results could be materially impacted by claims and other expenses related to such insurance plans if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tA Deterioration in Economic Conditions May Negatively Impact Sales in Both Our Business Segments. Our results of operations and financial condition are particularly sensitive to changes in the overall economy, including the level of consumer spending. Changes in discretionary spending patterns may decrease demand from our convenience store customers and/or impact the demand for natural food products in our retail health food stores as customers purchase cheaper product alternatives.. Additionally, many of our wholesale segment customers are thinly capitalized and their access to credit in the current business environment may be impacted by their ability to operate as a going concern, presenting additional credit risk for the Company. In a period of economic downturn or if the economy deteriorates, it could result in lower sales and profitability as well as customer credit defaults..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPeriods of Significant or Prolonged Inflation or Deflation Affect Our Product Costs and Profitability. Volatile product costs have a direct impact on our business. Prolonged periods of product cost inflation may have a negative impact on our profit margins and earnings to the extent that we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers, which may have a negative impact on our business and our profitability. In addition, product cost inflation may negatively impact consumer spending decisions, which could adversely impact our sales. Conversely, our business may be adversely impacted by periods of prolonged product cost deflation because we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage markup. As a result, our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation, even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe Rely Heavily on Our Information Technology Systems to Operate Our Business. Any Disruptions to These Technology Systems Including Security Breaches, Cyber - Attacks, Malware, or Other Methods by Which Our Information Systems Could Be Compromised, May Have A Material Negative Impact on Our Business.. We rely extensively on our information technology systems to run all aspects of our business. If any of our information technology systems are damaged or made unavailable due to a wide range of issues such as power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, malware, or compromised by any other method, it could have a material negative impact on our operations and profits..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAdverse Publicity About Us or Lack of Confidence in The Products We Carry Could Negatively Impact Our Reputation and Reduce Earnings. 12. Table of Contents. Maintaining a good reputation and public confidence in the products we distribute is critical to our business. Anything that damages that reputation or the public's confidence in our products, whether or not justified, including adverse publicity about the quality, safety or integrity of our products, could quickly and adversely affect our revenues and profits. In addition, such adverse publicity may result in product liability claims, a loss of reputation, and product recalls which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operations..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tImpairment Charges for Goodwill or Other Intangible Assets Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations.. We are required to test annually goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to determine if impairment has occurred. Additionally, interim reviews must be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non - cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or other intangible assets in the period the determination is made.. The testing of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment requires management to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including potential changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations, changes in competition or changes in our stock price and market capitalization. Changes in these factors, or changes in actual performance compared with estimates of our future performance, may affect the fair value of goodwill or other intangible assets, which may result in an impairment charge. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCapital Needed for Expansion May Not Be Available.. The acquisition of other distributors or existing retail stores, the opening of new retail stores, and the development of new or expansion of existing production and distribution facilities requires significant amounts of capital. In the past, our growth has been funded primarily through proceeds from bank debt, private placements of equity and debt and internally generated cash flow. These and other sources of capital may not be available to us in the future, which could impair our ability to further expand our business..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCovenants in Our Revolving Credit Facility May Restrict Our Ability to React to Changes Within Our Business or Industry.. Our revolving credit facility imposes certain restrictions on us that could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions by limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and industry. Specifically, these restrictions limit our ability, among other things, to incur additional indebtedness, make distributions, pay dividends, issue stock of subsidiaries, make investments, repurchase stock, create liens, enter into transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate, or transfer and sell our assets..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFailure to Meet Restrictive Covenants in Our Revolving Credit Facility Could Result in Acceleration of the Facility and We May not be Able to Find Alternative Financing.. Under our credit facility, we are required to maintain a minimum debt service ratio if our excess availability falls below 10% of the maximum loan limit as defined in our revolving credit agreement. Our ability to comply with this covenant may be affected by factors beyond our control. If we breach, or if our lender contends that we have breached this covenant or any other restrictions, it could result in an event of default under our revolving credit facility, which would permit our lenders to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable, and our lenders under our revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to make further extensions of credit under our revolving credit facility. Additionally, our real estate note payable includes a cross - default provision that would cause it to be in default and due immediately if our credit facility was deemed to be in default.. 13. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe May Not Be Able to Obtain Capital or Borrow Funds to Provide Us with Sufficient Liquidity and Capital Resources Necessary to Meet Our Future Financial Obligations.. We expect that our principal sources of funds will be cash generated from our operations and if necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. However, the current and future conditions in the credit markets may impact the availability of capital resources required to meet our future financial obligations, or to provide funds for our working capital, capital expenditures and other needs for the foreseeable future. We may require additional equity or debt financing to meet our working capital requirements or to fund our capital expenditures. We may not be able to obtain financing on terms satisfactory to us, or at all..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe Depend on Relatively Few Suppliers for a Large Portion of Our Products, and Any Interruptions in the Supply of the Products That We Sell Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition.. We do not have any long - term contracts with our suppliers committing them to provide products to us. Although our purchasing volume can provide leverage when dealing with suppliers, suppliers may not provide the products we sell in the quantities we request or on favorable terms. Because we do not control the actual production of the products we sell, we are also subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions beyond our control. These conditions include job actions or strikes by employees of suppliers, inclement weather, drought, transportation interruptions, and natural disasters or other catastrophic events. Our inability to obtain adequate supplies of the products we sell as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise, could cause us to fail to meet our obligations to our customers..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe Would Lose Business if Cigarette or Other Manufacturers That We Use Decide to Engage in Direct Distribution of Their Products.. In the past, some large manufacturers have decided to engage in direct distribution of their products and eliminate distributors such as our Company. If other manufacturers make similar product distribution decisions in the future, our revenues and profits would be adversely affected and there can be no assurance that we will be able to take action to compensate for such losses..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe Depend on Our Senior Management and Key Personnel.. We depend on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key personnel. While we have employment agreements with certain key personnel, the loss of service from any of our executive officers or key employees could harm our business..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe Operate in a Competitive Labor Market and Some of Our Employees Are Covered by Collective Bargaining Agreements.. We compete with other businesses in each of our markets with respect to attracting and retaining qualified employees. A shortage of qualified employees could require us to enhance our wage and benefits packages in order to compete effectively in the hiring and retention of qualified employees or to hire more expensive temporary employees.. In addition, at September 2017 approximately thirty of our delivery drivers in our Wholesale Segment are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with a labor organization, which expires in December 2017. If we were not able to renew our future labor agreements on similar terms, we may be unable to recover labor cost increases through increased prices or may suffer business interruptions as a result of strikes or other work stoppages..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe Are Subject to Significant Governmental Regulation and If We Are Unable to Comply with Regulations That Affect Our Business or If There Are Substantial Changes in These Regulations, Our Business Could Be Adversely Affected.. As a distributor and retailer of food products, we are subject to regulation by the FDA. Our operations are also subject to regulation by OSHA, the Department of Transportation and other federal, state and local agencies. Each of these regulatory authorities has broad administrative powers with respect to our operations. If we fail to adequately comply with government regulations or regulations become more stringent, we could experience increased inspections, regulatory authorities could take remedial action including imposing fines or shutting down our operations or we could be subject to increased audit. 14. Table of Contents. and compliance costs. If any of these events were to occur, our results of operations, business, cash flow, and financial condition would be adversely affected.. We cannot predict the impact that future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, the effect of additional government regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, or disparate federal, state and local regulatory schemes would have on our business in the future. They could, however, require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, the recall or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling and/or scientific substantiation. While we do not manufacture any products, any of the aforementioned items could disrupt the supply levels of inventory that we sell. Any or all of such requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, business, cash flow, and financial condition.. RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe Company Has Few Shareholders of Record And, If this Number Drops below 300, as was true as of September 30, 2017, the Company Will No Longer Be Obligated to Report under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and in Such Case We May Be Delisted from NYSE American, Reducing the Ability of Investors to Trade in Our Common Stock.. If the number of owners of record (including direct participants in the Depository Trust Company) of our common stock falls below 300, as was true as of September 30, 2017, our obligation to file reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 could be suspended. If we take advantage of this right we will likely reduce administrative costs of complying with public company rules, but periodic and current information updates about the Company would not be available to investors. In addition, the common stock of the Company would be removed from listing on NYSE American. This would likely impact investors' ability to trade in our common stock..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe Have Various Mechanisms in Place to Discourage Takeover Attempts, Which May Reduce or Eliminate Our Stockholders' Ability to Sell Their Shares for a Premium in a Change of Control Transaction.. Various provisions of our bylaws and of corporate law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control or takeover attempt of our company by a third party that is opposed by our management and Board of Directors. These anti - takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change of control or change in our management and Board of Directors. These provisions include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tclassification of our directors into three classes with respect to the time for which they hold office;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsupermajority voting requirements to amend the provision in our certificate of incorporation providing for the classification of our directors into three such classes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnon - cumulative voting for directors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontrol by our Board of Directors of the size of our Board of Directors;. 15. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadvance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by our stockholders at stockholder meetings."
