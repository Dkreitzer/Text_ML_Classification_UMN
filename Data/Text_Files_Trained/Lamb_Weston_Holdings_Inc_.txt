[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be material that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations in the future.. Increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits.. Our business, value-added frozen potato products, is highly competitive. Our principal competitors have substantial financial, sales and marketing, and other resources. A strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts could result in us reducing pricing, increasing promotional activity or losing market share. Competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other input cost increases or additional improvements in product quality. Our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume.. 10. Table of Contents. Increased industry capacity may result in reduced sales or profits.. In recent years, market demand for value-added frozen potato products has exceeded industry capacity to produce these products. As additional industry capacity comes online, or market demand otherwise decreases, we may face competitive pressures that would restrict our ability to increase or maintain prices. Our profits would decrease as a result of a reduction in prices or sales volume.. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations, including foreign currency risks and trade barriers.. We conduct a substantial and growing amount of business with customers located outside the United States and Canada, including through our joint ventures. During each of fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, net sales outside the United States and Canada, primarily in Japan, China, Korea, Mexico, and Taiwan, accounted for approximately 20% of our net sales. These amounts do not include any impact of unconsolidated net sales associated with our joint ventures, which are also subject to risks associated with international operations.. Many factors relating to our international sales and operations, many of which factors are outside of our control, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforeign exchange rates, foreign currency exchange and transfer restrictions, which may unpredictably and adversely impact our combined operating results, asset and liability balances, and cash flow in our combined and consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour combined and consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and we must translate the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and foreign governments, including modification or termination of existing trade agreements (e.g., the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\")) or treaties, creation of new trade agreements or treaties, trade regulations, and increased or new tariffs, quotas, import or export licensing requirements, and other trade barriers imposed by governments. In particular, changes in U.S. trade programs and trade relations with other countries, including the imposition of trade protection measures by foreign countries in favor of their local producers of competing products, such as governmental subsidies, tax benefits, and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over Lamb Weston, may adversely affect our business and results of operations in those countries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnegative economic developments in economies around the world and the instability of governments, including the threat of wars, terrorist attacks, epidemics or civil unrest;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpandemics, such as the flu, which may adversely affect our workforce as well as our local suppliers and customers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tearthquakes, tsunamis, floods or other major disasters that may limit the supply of raw materials that are purchased abroad for use in our international operations or domestically;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiffering labor standards in the international markets in which we operate;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiffering levels of protection of intellectual property across the international markets in which we operate;. 11. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties and costs associated with complying with U.S. laws and regulations applicable to entities with overseas operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe threat that our operations or property could be subject to nationalization and expropriation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvarying regulatory, tax, judicial and administrative practices in the international markets in which we operate;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties associated with operating under a wide variety of complex foreign laws, treaties and regulations; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotentially burdensome taxation.. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. Disruption of our access to export mechanisms could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. To serve our customers globally, we rely in part on our international joint venture partnerships, but also on exports from the United States. During fiscal 2018, export sales accounted for 19% of our total net sales. Circumstances beyond our control, such as a labor dispute at a port, could prevent us from exporting our products in sufficient quantities to meet customer opportunities. We have access to production overseas through our facility in China and joint venture in Europe, but we may be unsuccessful in mitigating any future disruption to export mechanisms. If this occurs, we may be unable to adequately supply all of our customer opportunities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. Our substantial debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations.. We incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with the Separation. As of May 27, 2018, we had $2,375.4 million of long-term debt, including current portion, recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We have the ability under our existing revolving credit facility to incur additional substantial debt. Our level of debt could have important consequences. For example, it could:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake it more difficult for us to make payments on our debt;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt.. 12. Table of Contents. The agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business.. The credit agreement governing our term loan and revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tborrow money or guarantee debt;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcreate liens;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake specified types of investments and acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into or permit to exist contractual limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into transactions with affiliates; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsell assets or merge with other companies.. These restrictions on our ability to operate our business could harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition, and other corporate opportunities. Various risks, uncertainties, and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.. Additionally, any failure to meet required payments on our debt, or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt, could result in a downgrade to our credit ratings. A downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs.. Our business relies on a potato crop that has a concentrated growing region.. Ideal growing conditions for the potatoes necessary for our value-added products (e.g., french fries) are concentrated in a few geographic regions globally. In the United States, most of the potato crop used in value-added products is grown in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. European growing regions for the necessary potatoes are concentrated in Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Recent agronomic developments have opened new growing regions, but the capital-intensive nature of our industry's production processes has kept production highly concentrated in the historical growing regions. Unfavorable crop conditions in any one region could lead to significant demand on the other regions for production. Our inability to mitigate any such conditions by leveraging our production capabilities in other regions could negatively impact our ability to meet customer opportunities and could decrease our profitability.. Our business is affected by potato crop performance.. Our primary input is potatoes and every year, we must procure potatoes that meet the quality standards for processing into value-added products. Environmental and climate conditions, such as soil quality, moisture, and. 13. Table of Contents. temperature, affect the quality of the potato crop on a year-to-year basis. As a result, we source potatoes from specific regions of the United States and specific countries abroad, including Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Canada, and China, where we believe the optimal potato growing conditions exist. However, severe weather conditions during the planting and growing season in these regions can significantly affect potato crop performance. Potatoes are also susceptible to pest diseases and insects that can cause crop failure, decreased yields, and negatively affect the physical appearance of the potatoes. We have deep experience in agronomy and actively work to monitor the potato crop. However, if a weather or pest-related event occurs in a particular crop year, and our agronomic programs are insufficient to mitigate the impacts thereof, we may have insufficient potatoes to meet our customer opportunities, and our competitiveness and profitability could decrease. Alternatively, overly favorable growing conditions can lead to high per acre yields and over-supply. An increased supply of potatoes could lead to overproduction of finished goods or destruction of unused potatoes at a loss.. Increases in commodity costs may have a negative impact on profits.. A significant portion of our cost of goods comes from commodities such as oil and energy. Commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, external conditions such as weather and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. Commodity price increases will increase our operating costs. We may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs; and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume and decreased profitability. There is currently no active derivatives market for potatoes in the United States. Although we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases, these practices and experience reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases. As a result, the risk management procedures that we use may not always work as we intend.. If we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive value-added frozen potato product category, our profitability could decrease.. Our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to maintain the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive value-added frozen potato product category. We continue to implement profit-enhancing initiatives that improve the efficiency of our supply chain and general and administrative functions. These initiatives are focused on cost-saving opportunities in procurement, manufacturing, logistics, and customer service, as well as general and administrative overhead levels. However, gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or the elimination of redundant costs could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position.. Changes in our relationships with our growers could adversely affect us.. We expend considerable resources to develop and maintain relationships with many potato growers. In some instances, we have entered into long-term agreements with growers; however, a portion of our potato needs are typically sourced on an annual basis. To the extent we are unable to maintain positive relationships with our long-term growers, contracted growers deliver less supply than we expect, or we are unable to secure sufficient potatoes from uncontracted growers in a given year, we may not have sufficient potato supply to satisfy our business opportunities. To obtain sufficient potato supply, we may be required to purchase potatoes at prices substantially higher than expected, or forgo sales to some market segments, which would reduce our profitability. If we forgo sales to such market segments, we may lose customers and may not be able to replace them later.. Changes in our relationships with significant customers could adversely affect us.. We maintain a diverse customer base across our four reporting segments. Customers include global, national and regional quick serve and fast casual restaurants as well as small, independently operated restaurants, multinational, broadline foodservice distributors, as well as regional foodservice distributors, and major food retailers. Some of these. 14. Table of Contents. customers independently represent a meaningful portion of our sales. While we contract annually or biannually with many of our foodservice customers, loss of a significant customer could materially impact the business. In addition, shelf space at food retailers is not guaranteed. During each of fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, our largest customer, McDonald's Corporation and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 11% of our net sales. There can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past. The loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. The sophistication and buying power of some of our customers could have a negative impact on profits.. Some of our customers are large and sophisticated, with buying power and negotiating strength. These customers may be more capable of resisting price increases and more likely to demand lower pricing, increased promotional programs, or specialty tailored products. In addition, some of these customers (e.g., larger distributors and supermarkets) have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own brands. We continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures, including efficiency programs and investments in innovation and quality. However, if we are unable to counteract the negotiating strength of these customers, our profitability could decline.. We must identify changing consumer preferences and consumption trends and develop and offer food products to our customers that help meet those preferences and trends.. Consumer preferences evolve over time and our success depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and offer products that appeal to those preferences. We need to continue to respond to these changing consumer preferences and support our customers in their efforts to evolve to meet those preferences. For example, as consumers focus on freshly prepared foods, some restaurants may choose to limit the frying capabilities of their kitchens. As a result, we would need to evolve our product offering to provide alternatives that work in such a preparation environment. In addition, our products contain carbohydrates, sodium, genetically modified ingredients, added sugars, saturated fats, and preservatives, the diet and health effects of which remain the subject of public scrutiny. We must continue to reformulate our products, introduce new products and create product extensions without a loss of the taste, texture, and appearance that consumers demand in value-added potato products. All of these efforts require significant research and development and marketing investments. If our products fail to meet consumer preferences or customer requirements, or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, then the return on those investments will be less than anticipated, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. A portion of our business is, and several of our growth strategies are, conducted through joint ventures that do not operate solely for our benefit.. We have built our company, in part, through the creation of joint ventures, some of which we do not control. In these relationships, we share ownership and management of a company that operates for the benefit of all owners, rather than our exclusive benefit. Through our extensive experience in operating a portion of our business through joint ventures, we understand that joint ventures often require additional resources and procedures for information sharing and decision-making. If our joint venture partners take actions that have negative impacts on the joint venture, or disagree with the strategies we have developed to grow these businesses, we may have limited ability to influence and mitigate those actions or decisions and our ability to achieve our growth strategies may be negatively impacted.. If we are unable to complete potential acquisitions that strategically fit our business objectives, integrate acquired businesses, or execute on large capital projects, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.. From time to time, we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives. Our acquisition activities may present financial, managerial, and operational risks. Those risks include: (i) diversion of. 15. Table of Contents. management attention from existing businesses, (ii) difficulties integrating personnel and financial and other systems, (iii) difficulties implementing effective control environment processes, (iv) adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, (v) inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets, which would reduce future reported earnings, (vi) potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses, and (vii) indemnities and potential disputes with the sellers. If we are unable to complete acquisitions we may identify or successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses or execute on large capital projects, such as new production lines, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.. New regulations imposed by the FDA or EFSA around acrylamide formation in french fried potato products could adversely affect us.. The regulation of food products, both within the United States and internationally, continues to be a focus for governmental scrutiny. The presence and/or formation of acrylamide in french fried potato products has become a global regulatory issue as both the FDA and the European Food Safety Authority (\"EFSA\") have issued guidance to the food processing industry to work to reduce conditions that favor the formation of this naturally occurring compound. Acrylamide formation is the result of heat processing reactions that give \"browned foods\" their desirable flavor. Acrylamide formation occurs in many food types in the human diet, including but not limited to breads, toast, cookies, coffee, crackers, potatoes, and olives. The regulatory approach to acrylamide has generally been to encourage the industry to achieve as low as reasonably achievable content levels through process control (temperature) and material testing (low sugar and low asparagine). However, limits for acrylamide content have been established for some food types in the State of California, and point of sale consumer warnings are required if products exceed those limits. In addition, the EFSA has recently promulgated regulations establishing specific mitigation measures, sampling and analysis procedures and benchmark levels for acrylamide in certain food products. If the global regulatory approach to acrylamide becomes more stringent and additional legal limits are established, our manufacturing costs could increase. In addition, if consumer perception regarding the safety of our products is negatively impacted due to regulation, sales of our products could decrease.. If we fail to comply with the many laws and regulations applicable to our business, we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties.. Our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the FDA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, quality, and safety of food products, the health and safety of our employees, and the protection of the environment. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products.. Our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, and comparable state agencies, which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes. Failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations for us, which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. Litigation could expose us to significant costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. We are, or may become, party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business, which may include lawsuits or claims relating to commercial liability, product recalls, product liability, product claims,. 16. Table of Contents. employment matters, environmental matters, or other aspects of our business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and although we may believe we have meaningful defenses in these matters, we may incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The costs of responding to or defending litigation may be significant and may divert the attention of management away from our strategic objectives. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that may decrease customer confidence in our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. We may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls, which could negatively impact our relationships with customers and harm our business.. We sell food products for human consumption, which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage, product tampering, other adulteration of food products, mislabeling, and misbranding. We may voluntarily recall or withdraw products from the market in certain circumstances, which would cause us to incur associated costs; those costs could be meaningful. We may also be subject to litigation, requests for indemnification from our customers, or liability if the consumption or inadequate preparation of any of our products causes injury, illness, or death. A significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on the costs of the recall, the destruction of product inventory, product availability, competitive reaction, customer reaction, and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image.. Additionally, as a manufacturer and marketer of food products, we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other national, state and local government agencies. The Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act and the Food Safety Modernization Act and their respective regulations govern, among other things, the manufacturing, composition and ingredients, packaging and safety of food products. Some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior; meaning that no intent is required to be established. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls, or seizures, as well as criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. Damage to our reputation as a trusted partner to customers and good corporate citizen could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. Our customers rely on us and our co-manufacturers to manufacture safe, high quality food products. Product contamination or tampering, the failure to maintain high standards for product quality, safety, and integrity, or allegations of product quality issues, mislabeling or contamination, even if untrue, may damage the reputation of our customers, and ultimately our reputation as a trusted industry partner. Damage to either could reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.. Our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following, or by adverse publicity (whether or not valid) relating thereto: the failure to maintain high ethical, social, and environmental standards for our operations and activities; our research and development efforts; our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, energy use, and waste management; our failure to comply with local laws and regulations; our failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls; or our failure to provide accurate and timely financial information. Damage to our reputation or loss of customer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.. 17. Table of Contents. Our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension, labor and people-related expenses.. Inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, including pension, health and welfare, and severance benefits. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations. Additionally, the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectively-bargained wage and benefit agreements.. We are significantly dependent on information technology, and we may be unable to protect our information systems against service interruption, misappropriation of data, or breaches of security.. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic and financial information, to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage, invasions, disruptions, or shutdowns due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer viruses, hackers, employee error or malfeasance, and other causes. Increased cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on those systems. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes, we could be subject to billing and collection errors, business disruptions, or damage resulting from security breaches. If any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results. Any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. In addition, if we are unable to prevent security breaches or unauthorized disclosure of non-public information, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, litigation or remediation costs, fines, or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers or suppliers.. Misuse, leakage, or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations, potentially significant fines and penalties, damage to our reputation and credibility, loss of strategic opportunities, and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts and, therefore, could have a negative impact on net sales. In addition, we may face business interruptions, litigation, and financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us, our current or former employees, or to our suppliers or customers, and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems.. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls.. We do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements. 18. Table of Contents. due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. If our controls become inadequate, we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, our reputation may be adversely affected, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected, and the market price of our stock could decline.. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be materially and adversely affected.. Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain personnel with professional and technical expertise, such as agricultural and food manufacturing experience, as well as finance, marketing, and other senior management professionals. The market for these employees is competitive, and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new high-quality employees, our business could be materially and adversely affected.. Climate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.. There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, the frequency and severity of extreme weather, and natural disasters. In the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as potatoes and oils. In addition, water is an important part of potato processing. We may be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water, which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases, as well as more stringent regulation of water rights. In the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions, improve our energy efficiency, and reduce and reuse water, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.. Deterioration of general economic conditions could harm our business and results of operations.. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions, including interest rates, access to capital markets, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges), and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions.. Volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in a variety of ways, including as follows:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdecreased demand in the restaurant business, particularly fast food and casual dining, which may adversely affect our business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvolatility in commodity and other input costs could substantially impact our results of operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvolatility in the financial markets or interest rates could substantially impact our pension costs and required pension contributions;. 19. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tit may become more costly or difficult to obtain debt or equity financing to fund operations or investment opportunities, or to refinance our debt in the future, in each case on terms and within a time period acceptable to us; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tit may become more costly to access funds internationally.. Impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth.. As of May 27, 2018, we had goodwill of $135.1 million and other intangibles of $35.4 million. The net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date (or subsequent impairment date, if applicable). The net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks, customer relationships, and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date (or subsequent impairment date, if applicable), net of accumulated amortization. Goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized, but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment. Amortized intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable. Impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control, such as increasing competitive pricing pressures, lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates, changes in industry earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") multiples, changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital (interest rates, etc.), or the bankruptcy of a significant customer, and could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth..

Table of Contents. We are subject to significant restrictions under a tax matters agreement.. In connection with the spinoff, we entered into a tax matters agreement with Conagra. The tax matters agreement generally prohibits us, during the two-year period following the spinoff, from taking certain actions that could cause the spinoff and certain related transactions to fail to qualify as tax-free transactions. These restrictions include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may not cause or permit certain business combinations or transactions to occur;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may not discontinue the active conduct of our business (within the meaning of Section 355(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\"Code\"));.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may not sell or otherwise issue our common stock, other than pursuant to issuances that satisfy certain regulatory safe harbors set forth in Treasury regulations related to stock issued to employees and retirement plans;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may not redeem or otherwise acquire any of our common stock, other than pursuant to certain open-market repurchases of less than 20% of our common stock (in the aggregate); and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may not amend our certificate of incorporation (or other organizational documents) or take any other action, whether through a stockholder vote or otherwise, affecting the voting rights of our common stock.. In addition, during the five-year period following the spinoff, we may not retire, repurchase, or significantly modify our senior notes. Further, more generally, we may not take any action that could reasonably be expected to cause the spinoff and certain related transactions to fail to qualify as tax-free transactions under Section 368(a)(1)(D) and Section 355 of the Code. If we take any of the actions above and the actions result in tax-related losses to Conagra, we generally will be required to indemnify Conagra for such tax-related losses under the tax matters agreement. Due to these restrictions and indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement, we may be limited in our ability to pursue strategic transactions, equity or convertible debt financings or other transactions that may otherwise be in our best interests. Also, our potential indemnity obligation to Conagra might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable.. If the spinoff is taxable to Conagra as a result of a breach by us of any covenant or representation made by us in the tax matters agreement, we will generally be required to indemnify Conagra; the obligation to make a payment on this indemnification obligation could have a material adverse effect on us.. It was intended that the spinoff, together with certain related transactions, would qualify as a tax-free \"reorganization\" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code and a tax-free distribution within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code. In connection with the spinoff, Conagra received an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that those transactions will qualify for their intended tax treatment. However, an opinion of tax counsel does not preclude the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") or the courts from adopting a contrary position. The tax opinion relied on certain representations, covenants, and assumptions, including those relating to our and Conagra's past and future conduct; if any of those representations, covenants or assumptions is inaccurate, the tax consequences of the spinoff could differ from the intended tax treatment. If the spinoff and/or certain related transactions fail to qualify for tax-free treatment, for any reason, Conagra and/or holders of its common stock would be subject to tax as a result of the spinoff and certain related transactions.. If the spinoff and/or the related transactions are not treated as tax-free transactions or are taxable to Conagra due to a breach by us (or any of our subsidiaries) of any covenant or representation made by us in the tax matters agreement, we will generally be required to indemnify Conagra for all tax-related losses suffered by Conagra in connection with the spinoff. In addition, we will not control the resolution of any tax contest relating to taxes suffered by Conagra in connection. 21. Table of Contents. with the spinoff, and we may not control the resolution of tax contests relating to any other taxes for which we may ultimately have an indemnity obligation under the tax matters agreement. In the event that Conagra suffers tax-related losses in connection with the spinoff that must be indemnified by us under the tax matters agreement, the indemnification liability could have a material adverse effect on us.. We are subject to continuing contingent liabilities following the spinoff, including potential indemnification liabilities to Conagra, and these liabilities could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. In connection with the spinoff, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with Conagra that provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions required to effect the spinoff, certain conditions to the spinoff, and provisions governing the relationship between our company and Conagra with respect to and resulting from the spinoff. Among other things, the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to the Lamb Weston business, whether incurred prior to or after the spinoff, and whether known or unknown at the time of the spinoff, as well as those obligations of Conagra assumed by us pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement. If we are required to indemnify Conagra under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement, or meaningful unknown liabilities surface, we may be subject to substantial liabilities.. In addition, under the Code and applicable Treasury regulations, each corporation that was a member of the Conagra consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the completion of the spinoff is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire Conagra consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period. Similar rules may apply for state, local, and non-U.S. tax purposes. In addition, the tax matters agreement with Conagra allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of any Conagra consolidated, combined, unitary or other tax reporting group between us and Conagra. However, if Conagra is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible under the tax matters agreement, we could be required to pay the entire amount of those taxes, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. In connection with the spinoff, Conagra agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Conagra's ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future.. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, Conagra agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Conagra has agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Conagra will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of those liabilities, or that Conagra will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Conagra any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. If Conagra is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations, the underlying liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.. Further, Conagra's insurers may deny coverage to us for liabilities associated with occurrences prior to the spinoff. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from such insurance providers, we may be required to temporarily bear such loss of coverage."
