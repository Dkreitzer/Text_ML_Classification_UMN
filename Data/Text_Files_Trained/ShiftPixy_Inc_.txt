[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. Some statements in this Report, including statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\". 13   Table of Contents. Risks Relating to Our Business. We have limited operating history, which makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those estimates of our future performance.. We are an emerging business and are in the process of developing our products and services. We have been in business for 26 months as of August 31, 2017. Although we have now generated gross billings of $50,672,129 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, and $126,391,207 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017, it is still difficult, if not impossible, to forecast our future results based upon our limited but now positive historical operating data. Because of the related uncertainties, we may be hindered in our ability to anticipate and timely adapt to increases or decreases in sales, revenues or expenses. If we make poor budgetary decisions as a result of unreliable data, our gross billings in the future may decline, which may result in a decline in our stock price.. There is uncertainty regarding our ability to implement our business plan and to grow our business to a greater extent than we can with our existing financial resources without additional financing. Except from the proceeds of our recent IPO, we have no binding agreements, commitments or understandings to secure additional financing at this time. We have no binding agreements, commitments or understandings to acquire any other businesses or assets. Our long-term future growth and success is dependent upon our ability to generate cash from operating activities. There is no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash from operations, to borrow additional funds or to raise additional equity capital. Our inability to obtain additional cash could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fully implement our business plan as described herein and grow our business to a greater extent than we can with our existing financial resources.. We may be subject to penalties and interest payable on taxes as a result of software or manual error.. Our input of data in the software must be effected properly in order to process the data and payments correctly with regard to clients, employees and applicable tax agencies. If we input incorrect data or input accurate data incorrectly, we could inadvertently overbill or underbill our clients or overpay or underpay applicable taxes, resulting in the loss of net income and/or clients and/or the incurrence of tax penalties and interest. Despite our efforts to reconcile taxes on a monthly basis, we may incur additional taxes, penalties and interest for which we may or may not bill the clients.. 14   Table of Contents. Our targeted customer base is diverse, and we face a challenge in adequately meeting each group's needs.. Because we will serve both employers and employees, we must work constantly to understand the needs, standards and requirements of each group and must devote significant resources to developing products and services for their interests. If we do not accurately predict our customers' needs and expectations, we may expend valuable resources in developing products and services that do not achieve broad acceptance across the markets, and we may fail to grow our business.. Our success depends on adoption of our products and services by our various types of customers, and if these potential customers do not accept and acquire our products and services then our revenue will be severely limited.. The major customer groups to whom we believe our products and services will appeal, both employers and employees, particularly related to shift work, may not embrace our products and services. Acceptance of our products and services will depend on several factors, including: cost, ease of use, familiarity of use, convenience, timeliness, strategic partnerships, and reliability. If we fail to adequately meet our customers' needs and expectations, our product offerings may not be competitive and our ability to commence or continue generating revenues could be reduced. We also cannot be sure that our business model will gain wide acceptance among all targeted customer groups. If the market fails to continue to develop, or develops more slowly than we expect, our ability to continue generating revenues could be reduced.. Competing forms of Gig Economy oriented staffing management products and services may be more desirable to consumers or may make our products and services obsolete.. There are currently several different competing Gig Economy oriented staffing management product and service technologies that are being marketed to our potential customers. Further development of any of these technologies may lead to advancements in technology that will make our products and services obsolete. Consumers may prefer alternative technologies and products and services. We cannot guarantee that users of Gig Economy oriented staffing management products and services who will be using our products and services will continue to grow within the industry as a whole. Any developments that contribute to the obsolescence of our products and services may substantially impact our business, reducing our ability to sustain generating revenues.. Damage claims against us as a result of actions of our employees could reduce our sales and revenues.. If any one of our employees is found to cause injury or damage through one or more negligent or wrongful acts, including sexual harassment and other employment related offenses, the Company could suffer financial damages as a result of claims by the injured party. We have not had significant claims for damages or losses from actions of our employee workers to date. The Company carries a staffing liability program commercial insurance policy, but the policy provides coverage only with respect to: 1. \"wrongful employment acts\" committed against our \"employees\" pursuant to our agreement with that client; and 2. A \"staffing services worker's\" acts committed while in the service of our client that result in a \"wrongful business environment.\" The insurer may seek to disclaim liability as not covered or for other reasons or the amount of judgment against us may exceed the policy limits. Any claims for damages against us as a result of actions of our work employees could damage our reputation, increase our expenses and reduce our profitability (or increase net losses) and revenues.. 15   Table of Contents. Lapses in our employee screening process may result in potential litigation, which may be costly and/or damage our reputation.. If we experience lapses in our employee screening process, we may face potential litigation from our clients or government regulators, which may be costly and/or damage our reputation.. If we are unable to secure or pay for the insurance coverage required for our business operations, or if we lose any existing coverage, we may not be able to offer some of our services and our revenues could be reduced.. We are required to obtain and maintain various types of insurance coverage for our business, in particular health and workers' compensation insurance related to our employees. Although we have contracts with all types of providers currently necessary for our business, if in the future we are unable to secure the insurance coverage required for our business operations, or if we lose any existing coverage, we may not be able to offer some of our services and our revenues could be reduced. In addition, any increases in the cost of insurance coverage we are required to maintain could reduce profitability (or increase net losses).. The Company assumes the obligation to make wage, tax, and regulatory payments for our shifter employees, and, as a result, is exposed to client credit risks.. The Company generally assumes responsibility for and manages the risks associated with shifter employees' payroll obligations, including liability for payment of salaries, wages, and certain taxes. These obligations are fixed, whether or not clients make payments as required by services contracts, which exposes the Company to credit risks of clients.. Workers' compensation costs for shifter employees may rise and reduce our margins and require more liquidity.. The Company is responsible for and pays workers' compensation costs for its shift workers. At times, these costs have risen substantially as a result of increased claims and claim trends, general economic conditions, changes in business mix, increases in healthcare costs, and government regulations. Although the Company carries insurance, unexpected changes in claim trends, including the severity and frequency of claims, actuarial estimates, and medical cost inflation could result in costs that are significantly different than initially reported. If future claims-related liabilities increase due to unforeseen circumstances, or if new laws, rules, or regulations are passed, costs could increase significantly. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase the fees charged to clients in a timely manner and in a sufficient amount to cover increased costs as a result of any changes in claims-related liabilities.. 16   Table of Contents. Failure to comply with, or changes in, laws and regulations applicable to our business, particularly potential changes to the ACA, could have a materially adverse effect on our marketing plan as well as our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences.. Our business is subject to a wide range of complex laws and regulations. For example, many states regulate entities offering the employment related services such as those offered by us directly or through our subsidiary and require licenses as a prerequisite to operation of such enterprises in their respective jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that either ShiftPixy or its subsidiary, ShiftableHR, will be successful in either securing or maintaining a license or licenses in compliance with a particular state's laws and regulations. Further, many states require variously that workers' compensation policies offered by employment related firms such as ours to be managed according to strict rules and/or that unemployment insurance filings be administered according to strict rules.. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of services, and the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties, including fines, that could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition.. In addition, changes in laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of laws or regulations by a regulatory authority, may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business. For example, a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities. Changes in taxation regulations could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income. Changes in laws that govern the co-employment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business. Healthcare reform under the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\"), as amended, related state laws, and the regulations adopted or to be adopted thereunder, have the potential to impact substantially the way that employers provide health insurance to employees and the health insurance market for the small and mid-sized businesses that constitute our business's clients and prospects. If the ACA is repealed or replaced, the elimination of employer mandates and similar employer requirements currently imposed by the ACA, and other regulatory changes could in the future reduce our revenues. Amendments to money transmitter statutes have required us to obtain licenses in some jurisdictions. The adoption of new money transmitter statutes in other jurisdictions, changes in regulators' interpretation of existing state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes or regulations, or disagreement by a regulatory authority with our interpretation of such existing statutes or regulations, could require additional registration or licensing, limit certain of our business activities until they are appropriately licensed, and expose us to financial penalties. These occurrences could also require changes to our compliance programs and to the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our money movement business or client funds investment strategy, which could adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted.. 17   Table of Contents. We collect, use, transmit and store with data services vendors personal and business information, and a security or privacy breach may damage or disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.. In connection with our business, we collect, use, transmit and store with data services vendors large amounts of personal and business information about our clients and shift employees, including payroll information, healthcare information, personal and limited business financial data, social security numbers, bank account numbers, tax information and other sensitive personal and business information. In addition, as we continue to grow the scale of our offering, we will process and store with data services vendors an increasing volume of personally identifiable information of our users. Our data services vendors include PrismHR, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft OneDrive, ShareFile, Dropbox, Smartsheet, MasterTax, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Office 365, and RightSignature; we believe these vendors implement industry standard or greater data security measures to protect the data that we transmit through and/or store with them. Despite our efforts to protect customer data, perceptions that the collection, use, and storage of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our services, and could limit adoption of our services. In addition, the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security.. We are focused on ensuring that our operating environments safeguard and protect personal and business information, and we will be required devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes. Despite our efforts to maintain security controls across our business, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer data we or our vendors store and manage. In addition, attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication, and the Company may be targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics, code and viruses.. We have third party contractors who monitor our activities in a manner designed to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third-parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data or our systems. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third-parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other methods of deceiving our employees, contractors, and temporary staff. As these threats continue to evolve, we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. In addition, while our operating environment is designed to safeguard and protect personal and business information, we do not have the ability to monitor the implementation of similar safeguards by our clients, vendors or their respective employees, and, in any event, third-parties may be able to circumvent those security measures.. 18   Table of Contents. Any cyber-attack, unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption, denial of service, corruption of data, or theft of non-public or other sensitive information, similar act by a malevolent party, or inadvertent acts by our own employees, could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, harm our reputation, and could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations, or that of our clients, create financial liability, regulatory sanction, or a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients or cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider, and subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Although we believe that through our third-party contractors we maintain a program of information security and controls and any threats that we might have encountered to date have not materially impacted us, the impact of a data security incident could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have insurance coverage for risks for exchanging and maintaining data electronically that is designed to address certain aspects of cyber-risks, such insurance coverage may be denied or be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber-risk. In addition, any further security measures we may undertake to address further protections, may cause higher operating expenses.. We are also subject to various federal and state laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use, transmission and security of personal and business information. In addition, the possession and use of personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to laws that may require notification to regulators, clients or employees in the event of a privacy breach and may impose liability on us for privacy deficiencies, including but not limited to liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and regulatory penalties. These laws continue to develop, the number of jurisdictions adopting such laws continues to increase, and these laws may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules or regulations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability. In addition, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase.. Some of the activities in which our shift workers could become involved could include health care information related responsibilities and could thereby invoke the need for compliance with HIPAA as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH. The United States Department of Health and Human Services issued regulations that establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic health care transactions and protecting the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by health care providers and other covered entities. Three principal regulations with which we are required to comply have been issued in final form under HIPAA: privacy regulations, security regulations, and standards for electronic transactions, which establish standards for common health care transactions. The privacy regulations cover the use and disclosure of protected health information by health care providers. They also set forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her protected health information maintained by a health care provider, including the right to access or amend certain records containing protected health information or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of protected health information. The security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. The HITECH Act, among other things, establishes certain health information security breach notification requirements. A covered entity must notify any individual whose protected health information is breached. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a uniform federal \"floor\" and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing protected health information. These laws contain significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information. Additionally, to the extent that we submit electronic health care claims and payment transactions that do not comply with the electronic data transmission standards established under HIPAA and HITECH, payments to us may be delayed or denied.. 19   Table of Contents. If we are unable to effectively manage growth and maintain low operating costs, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.. We have experienced rapid growth since our inception, and our plans contemplate significant expansion of our business. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, including having geographically dispersed offices and employees or to anticipate and manage our future growth accurately, our business may be adversely affected. If we are unable to manage our expansion and growth effectively, we may be unable to keep our operating costs low or effectively meet the requirements of an ever-growing, geographically dispersed client base. Our business relies on data systems, billing systems and financial reporting and control systems, procedures and controls. Our success in managing our expansion and growth in a cost-effective manner will require us to upgrade and improve these systems, procedures and controls. If we are unable to adapt our systems and put adequate controls in place in a timely manner, our business may be adversely affected. In addition, our growth may place significant demands on our management, and our overall operational and financial resources. A failure on our part to meet any of the foregoing challenges inherent in our growth strategy may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.. Our independent registered public accountants will not be required to provide an attestation report as to our internal control over financial reporting for the foreseeable future.. Our independent registered public accounting firm has not provided an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As an issuer of securities under Regulation A, we do not expect to be required to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, unless and until we become a reporting company under the Exchange Act and, thereafter, no longer qualify as an emerging growth company or are no longer a non-accelerated filer, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, whichever is later. Currently, we would expect to be an emerging growth company for up to five years after we become a reporting company under the Exchange Act. As a result of the foregoing, for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any attestation concerning our internal control over financial reporting from us or our independent registered public accountants.. We face intense competition across all markets for our services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins.. Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower service lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to customers.. Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models. The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.. 20   Table of Contents. Technology Oriented Risks. If we are unable to protect our proprietary and technology rights our operations will be adversely affected.. Our success will depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights and technologies, including those related to our products and services. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property is difficult. Except as otherwise noted herein, we have not applied for any formal patent, trademark or similar protection. Our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights may adversely affect our operations. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary. Based on the nature of our business, we may or may not be able to adequately protect our rights through patent, copyright and trademark laws. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the United States or abroad may not be adequate, and competitors may independently develop similar technologies. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to:.  Enforce intellectual property rights;            Protect our trade secrets;            Determine the validity and scope of the rights of others; or            Defend against claims of infringement or invalidity.. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs if we are held to have willfully infringed or to expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology and would divert the attention of management from the implementation of our business strategy. Furthermore, the outcome of litigation is inherently difficult to predict and we may not prevail in any litigation in which we become involved.. Software products we use in our business may contain defects which will make it more difficult for us to establish and maintain customers.. We are currently using PrismHR software for our payroll processing. We also use MasterTax to process our tax reports and filings. We also use a host of other software products in the course of conducting our business. Of course, the mobile app component of our mobile platform, along with the client portal and the ShiftPixy Command Hub, constitute our proprietary software and contain components that are licensed from third parties and that are public domain software. Our payroll processing software and other software products we use in our business may contain undetected design faults and software errors, or \"bugs\" that are discovered only after they has been installed and used by a greater number of customers. Any such defect or error in new or existing software or applications could cause delays in delivering our technology or require design modifications. These could adversely affect our competitive position and cause us to lose potential customers or opportunities. Since our technologies are intended to be utilized to supply human resources related services, the effect of any such bugs or delays will likely have a detrimental impact on us. In addition, given that our specialized human resources software and services has yet to gain widespread acceptance in the market, any delays or other problems caused by software bugs would likely have a more detrimental impact on our business than if we were a more established company.. 21   Table of Contents. If a contract relating to our mission critical software that we use in our business is terminated or not renewed, our business could be seriously disrupted and our revenues significantly reduced.. If a contract relating to our mission-critical software services, such as that applicable to payroll and payroll tax processing, is terminated or non-renewed, and we do not have an effective replacement software, our business and revenues would suffer. Although there are other software vendors we can use, it may take time to negotiate an agreement and make operational this replacement software. Accordingly, if the software agreements that we use in our business are terminated or not renewed, our business could be seriously disrupted and our revenues significantly reduced until we locate and make operational replacement software.. Our systems may be subject to disruptions that could have a materially adverse effect on our business and reputation.. Our business is and will continue to be highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of complicated transactions. We rely heavily on our payroll, financial, accounting, and other data processing systems. We may not be successful in preventing the loss of client data, service interruptions or disruptions to our operations from system failures. If any of these systems fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention, or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition.. Because we store data in the cloud with providers such as Microsoft and Amazon, any disruptions in our ability to access this data or any breach of security concerning this data in the cloud could have a materially adverse effect on our business and reputation.. Our business is and will continue to be highly dependent on data storage in the cloud with providers such as Microsoft and Amazon. These cloud storage systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period of time. There could also be security breaches of our data stored in the cloud. If there is loss of client data, service interruptions or disruptions to our operations related to our cloud data storage, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention, or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition.. We make significant investments in our software that may not achieve our expectations.. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.. 22   Table of Contents. Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.. From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. Besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies.. We may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.. Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. We take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If a significant portion of our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that source code. It may become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph.. 23   Table of Contents. We may have outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more data. These demands continue to increase as we grow our workforce. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient Internet connectivity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by users and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition.. Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.. Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver services successfully may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs.. 24   Table of Contents. We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices, significant business transactions, operational claims, and employment practices. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.. Our software may experience quality or supply problems.. Our software may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly-sophisticated software we have been developing may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.. Risks Related to Management and Personnel. We depend heavily on Mr. Scott W. Absher, CEO and Director. The loss of his services could harm our business.. Our future business and results of operations depend in significant part upon the continued contributions Mr. Scott W. Absher, CEO and Director. If we lose his services or if he fails to perform in his current position, or if we are not able to attract and retain skilled employees in addition to Mr. Scott W. Absher, CEO and Director, this could adversely affect the development of our business plan and harm our business.. Mr. Absher has limited experience managing a public company, which may inhibit our ability to implement successfully our business plan.. Mr. Scott W. Absher, CEO and Director and the beneficial owner of approximately 43.177% of our stock as of August 31, 2017, has limited experience managing a public company, which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are endeavoring to comply with all of the various rules and regulations, which are required for a public company that is reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, if we cannot operate successfully as a public company, your investment may be materially adversely affected.. 25   Table of Contents. Industry Risks. Providing specialized Gig Economy oriented staffing management products and services is an emerging yet competitive business, and many of our competitors have greater resources that may enable them to compete more effectively.. We will compete in the same markets with many companies that offer not only staffing management products and services focused on the Gig Economy but also more traditional staffing management products and services. There are limited barriers to entry. Price competition in the industry, particularly from larger, more traditional industry model competitors, is intense, and pricing pressures from competitors and clients are increasing. New competitors entering our markets may further increase pricing pressures.. Clients may competitively bid new contracts; a trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do, which may enable them to compete more effectively in this market. Our competitors may devote their resources to developing and marketing products and services that will directly compete with our product lines, and new, more efficient competitors may enter the market. If we are unable to successfully compete with existing companies and new entrants to the market this will have a negative impact on our business and financial condition.. We operate in an immature and rapidly evolving industry and have a relatively new business model, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.. The industry in which we operate is characterized by rapidly changing regulatory requirements, evolving industry standards and shifting user and client demands. Our business model is also evolving and is different from models used by other companies in our industry. As a result of these factors, the success and future revenue and income potential of our business is uncertain. Any evaluation of our business and our prospects must be considered in light of these risks and uncertainties, some of which relate to our ability to:.  Expand employer and employee client relationships;            Increase the number of our employer clients and grow a shifter employee base;    Develop relationships with third-party vendors such as insurance companies;            Expand operations and implement and improve our operational, financial and management controls;            Raise capital at attractive costs, or at all;            Attract and retain qualified management, employees and independent service providers;            Successfully introduce new processes, technologies products and services and upgrade our existing processes, technologies, products and services;            Protect our proprietary processes and technologies and our intellectual property rights; and            Respond to government regulations relating to the Internet, personal data protection, email, software technologies, cyber security and other regulated aspects of our business.. If we are unable to successfully address the challenges posed by operating in an immature and rapidly evolving industry and having a relatively new business model, our business could suffer.. 26   Table of Contents. If ShiftPixy is not recognized as an employer of worksite employees under federal and state regulations, or we are deemed to be an insurance agent or third-party administrator, we and our clients could be adversely impacted.. While in our professional employer organization client engagements through ShiftableHR, we typically arrange for clients to act as sponsor of employee benefit plans, ShiftPixy sponsors the benefit plans applicable to its employees. In order for ShiftPixy to sponsor employee benefit plan offerings for our worksite employees, we must qualify as an employer of our worksite employees for certain purposes under the Code and ERISA. In addition, our status as an employer is important for purposes of ERISA's preemption of certain state laws. The definition of employer under various laws is not uniform, and under both the Code and ERISA, the term is defined in part by complex multi-factor tests.. Generally, these tests are designed to evaluate whether an individual is an independent contractor or employee and they provide substantial weight to whether a purported employer has the right to direct and control the details of an individual's work. Some factors that the IRS has considered important in the past have included the employer's degree of behavioral control (the extent of instructions, training and the nature of the work), the financial control and the economic aspects of the relationship, and the intent of the parties, as evidenced by the specific benefit, contract, termination and other similar arrangements between the parties and the on-going versus project-oriented nature of the work to be performed. However, a definitive judicial interpretation of \"employer\" in the context of joint employer relationships such as those in which ShiftPixy engages has not been established. For ERISA purposes, for example, courts have held that test factors relating to ability to control and supervise an individual are less important, while the U.S. Department of Labor has issued guidance that certain entities in the HR outsourcing industry do not qualify as common law employers for ERISA purposes. Moreover, when ShiftPixy's app is fully functional, the scope of ShiftPixy's employer status will increase, changing the legal analysis. Although we believe that ShiftPixy qualifies as an employer of its worksite employees under ERISA, and the U.S. Department of Labor has not provided guidance otherwise, we are not able to predict the outcome of any future regulatory challenge.. If we are not recognized as an employer under the Code or ERISA, we may be required to change the method by which we report and remit payroll taxes to the tax authorities and the method by which we provide, or discontinue providing, certain employee benefits to our worksite employees, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. We must also qualify as an employer of our worksite employees under state regulations, which govern licensing, certification and registration requirements for PEOs. Nearly all states have enacted laws and regulations in this regard. While we believe that we qualify as an employer of our worksite employees under these state regulations, these requirements vary from state to state and change frequently and if we are not able to satisfy existing or future licensing requirements or other applicable regulations of any states, we may be prohibited from doing business in that state.. 27   Table of Contents. Economic, Catastrophic and Geopolitical Risks. Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business.. Monetary and fiscal policies and political and economic conditions may substantially change. When there is a slowdown in the economy, employment levels may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses. Clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services or renegotiating their contracts with us.. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause businesses to rely less on vendors in our business, which could adversely affect our revenue. If demand for our services declines, or business spending for such services declines, our revenue will be adversely affected.. Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.. We are dependent upon various large banks to execute Automated Clearing House and wire transfers as part of our client payroll and tax services. A systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll and tax services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity.. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Irvine, California, area, which is a seismically active region. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations.. Abrupt political change and terrorist activity may pose threats to our business and increase our operating costs. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers, and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory requirements that could impact our operating strategies, hiring, and profitability.. 28   Table of Contents. Market Risks.
