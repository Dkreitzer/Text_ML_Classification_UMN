[1] "ITEM 1A:    RISK FACTORS. We are dependent on franchise renewals.. Each of our franchise agreements is 10 years long.  At the end of the term of each franchise agreement, each franchisee may, if certain conditions are met, \"renew\" the franchise relationship by signing a new 10-year franchise agreement.  As of December 30, 2017 each of our five franchised retail brands have the following number of franchise agreements that will expire over the next three years:. 2018 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t     \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t2019 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t     \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t2020 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tPlato's Closet \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 30 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 45 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 46 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tOnce Upon A Child \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 16 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 27 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 29 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tPlay It Again Sports \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 13 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 16 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 26 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tMusic Go Round \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  3 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  4 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  2 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tStyle Encore \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t -  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t -  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t -  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 62 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 92 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t 103. We believe that renewing a significant number of these franchise relationships is important to our continued success.  If a significant number of franchise relationships are not renewed, our financial performance would be materially and adversely impacted.. We are dependent on new franchisees.. Our ability to generate increased revenue and achieve higher levels of profitability depends in part on increasing the number of franchises open.  Unfavorable macro-economic conditions may affect the ability of potential franchisees to obtain external financing and/or impact their net worth, both of which could lead to a lower level of openings than we have historically experienced.  There can be no assurance that we will sustain our current level of franchise openings.. We are in the early stages of a new franchising initiative.. We are currently investing in a new initiative to provide consulting services, support and capital to emerging franchisors.  There can be no assurance that we will be successful in this undertaking and that it will not have a negative impact on our financial performance.. 9. Table of Contents. We may make additional investments outside of our core businesses.. From time to time, we have and may continue to make investments both inside and outside of our current businesses.  To the extent that we make additional investments that are not successful, such investments could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.. We may sell franchises for a territory, but the franchisee may not open.. We believe that a substantial majority of franchises awarded but not opened will open within the time period permitted by the applicable franchise agreement or we will be able to resell the territories for most of the terminated or expired franchises.  However, there can be no assurance that substantially all of the currently sold but unopened franchises will open and commence paying royalties to us.. Our retail franchisees are dependent on supply of used merchandise.. Our retail brands are based on offering customers a mix of used and new merchandise.  As a result, the ability of our franchisees to obtain continuing supplies of high quality used merchandise is important to the success of our brands.  Supply of used merchandise comes from the general public and is not regular or highly reliable. In addition, adherence to federal and state product safety and other requirements may limit the amount of used merchandise available to our franchisees.  In addition to laws and regulations that apply to businesses generally, our franchised retail stores may be subject to state or local statutes or ordinances that govern secondhand dealers.  There can be no assurance that our franchisees will avoid supply problems with respect to used merchandise.. We may be unable to collect accounts receivable from franchisees.. In the event that our ability to collect accounts receivable significantly declines from current rates, we may incur additional charges that would affect earnings.  If we are unable to collect payments due from our franchisees, it would materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.. We operate in extremely competitive industries.. Retailing, including the sale of teenage, children's and women's apparel, sporting goods and musical instruments, is highly competitive.  Many retailers have significantly greater financial and other resources than us and our franchisees.  Individual franchisees face competition in their markets from retailers of new merchandise and, in certain instances, resale, thrift and other stores that sell used merchandise.  We may face additional competition as our franchise systems expand and if additional competitors enter the used merchandise market.. Our equipment leasing businesses compete with a variety of equipment financing sources that are available to businesses, including: national, regional, and local finance companies that provide leases and loan products; financing through captive finance and leasing companies affiliated with major equipment manufacturers; and commercial banks, savings and loans, credit unions and credit cards.  Many of these companies are substantially larger than we are and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.  There can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully compete with these larger competitors.. We are subject to credit risk in our lease portfolio and our allowance for credit losses may be inadequate to absorb losses.. In our leasing business, if we inaccurately assess the creditworthiness of our customers, we may experience a higher number of lease defaults than expected, which would reduce our earnings.  For our middle-market customers, we serve a wide range of businesses from smaller companies that may be financed by venture capital investors to larger organizations that may be financed by private equity firms and larger independent public or private companies.  In many cases, our credit analysis relies on the customer's current or projected financials.  If we fail to adequately assess the risks of our customer's business plans, we may experience credit losses.  For our small-ticket customers, there is typically only limited publicly available financial and other information about their businesses.  Accordingly, in making credit decisions, we rely upon the accuracy of information from the small business owner and/or third party sources, such as credit reporting agencies. If the information we obtain from small business owners and/or third party sources is incorrect, our ability to make appropriate credit decisions will be impaired.. 10. Table of Contents. We may incur concentration of credit risk in our lease portfolio.  As of December 30, 2017, leased assets with one customer represented approximately 30% of our total net investment in leases.. If losses from leases exceed our allowance for credit losses, our operating income will be reduced.  In connection with our leases, we record an allowance for credit losses to provide for estimated losses.  Determining the appropriate level of the allowance is an inherently uncertain process and therefore our determination of this allowance may prove to be inadequate to cover losses in connection with our portfolio of leases.  Losses in excess of our allowance for credit losses would cause us to increase our provision for credit losses, reducing or eliminating our operating income.  Any such significant increase in losses could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.. Deterioration in economic or business conditions may negatively impact our leasing business.. In an economic slowdown or recession, our equipment leasing businesses may face an increase in delinquent payments, lease defaults and credit losses.  The volume of leasing business for our new and existing customers may decline, as well as the credit quality of our customers.  Because we extend credit to many emerging and leveraged companies through our subsidiary Winmark Capital Corporation and primarily to small businesses through our subsidiary Wirth Business Credit, Inc., our customers may be particularly susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions.   Any protracted economic slowdowns or recessions may make it difficult for us to maintain the volume of lease originations for new and existing customers, and may deteriorate the credit quality of new leases.  Any of these events may slow the growth of our leasing portfolio and impact the profitability of our leasing operations.. We are subject to restrictions in our line of credit and note facilities.  Additionally, we are subject to counter party risk in our line of credit facility.. The terms of our $50.0 million line of credit and $37.5 million note facility impose certain operating and financial restrictions on us and require us to meet certain financial tests including tests related to minimum levels of debt service coverage and tangible net worth and maximum levels of leverage.  As of December 30, 2017, we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants under these facilities; however, failure to comply with these covenants in the future may result in default under one or both of these sources of capital and could result in acceleration of the related indebtedness.  Any such acceleration of indebtedness would have an adverse impact on our business activities and financial condition.. Sustained credit market deterioration could jeopardize the counterparty obligations of one or both of the banks participating in our line of credit facility, which could have an adverse impact on our business if we are not able to replace such credit facility or find other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms.. We have indebtedness.. We incurred indebtedness in connection with the purchase of shares in the 2015 Tender Offer and the 2017 Tender Offer (see Note 6  -  \"Shareholders' Equity (Deficit)\" and Note 7  -  \"Debt\").  We expect to generate the cash necessary to pay our expenses, finance our leasing business and to pay the principal and interest on all of our outstanding debt from cash flows provided by operating activities and by opportunistically using other means to repay or refinance our obligations as we determine appropriate.  Our ability to pay our expenses, finance our leasing business and meet our debt service obligations depends on our future performance, which may be affected by financial, business, economic, and other factors.  If we do not have enough money to pay our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity.  In such an event, we may not be able to refinance our debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us or at all.  Also, our ability to carry out any of these activities on favorable terms, if at all, may be further impacted by any financial or credit crisis which may limit access to the credit markets and increase our cost of capital.. We are subject to government regulation.. As a franchisor, we are subject to various federal and state franchise laws and regulations.  Fourteen states, the Federal Trade Commission and six Canadian Provinces impose pre-sale franchise registration and/or disclosure requirements on franchisors.  In addition, a number of states have statutes which regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship such as termination, nonrenewal, transfer, discrimination among franchisees and competition with franchisees.. 11. Table of Contents. Additional legislation, both at the federal and state levels, could expand pre-sale disclosure requirements, further regulate substantive aspects of the franchise relationship and require us to file our franchise offering circulars with additional states.  Future franchise legislation could impose costs or other burdens on us that could have a material adverse impact on our operations.  In addition, evolving labor and employment laws, rules and regulations could result in potential claims against us as a franchisor for labor and employment related liabilities that have historically been borne by franchisees.. Although most states do not directly regulate the commercial equipment lease financing business, certain states require licensing of lenders and finance companies, impose limitations on interest rates and other charges, constrain collection practices and require disclosure of certain contract terms.  Laws or regulations may be adopted with respect to our equipment leases or the equipment leasing industry, and collection processes. Any new legislation or regulation, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, which affect the equipment leasing industry could increase our costs of compliance.. We may be unable to protect against data security risks.. We have implemented security systems with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and protecting our employees, franchisees, lessees, customers', clients' and suppliers' confidential information and information related to identifiable individuals against unauthorized access through our information systems or by other electronic transmission or through the misdirection, theft or loss of physical media.  These include, for example, the appropriate encryption of information.  Despite such efforts, we are subject to potential breach of security systems which may result in unauthorized access to our facilities or the information we are trying to protect.  Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly changing and becoming increasingly more sophisticated and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement sufficient preventative measures.  If unauthorized parties gain physical access to one of our facilities or electronic access to our information systems or such information is misdirected, lost or stolen during transmission or transport, any theft or misuse of such information could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business."
