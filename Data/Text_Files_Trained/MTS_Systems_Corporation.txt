[1] "ITEM 1A.          RISK FACTORS. Our business involves risks. The following summarizes what we believe to be the most important risks facing us that could adversely impact our business, financial condition or operating results. The information about these risks should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.. Market Risks. Our business is significantly international in scope.. We have manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe and Asia. Sales outside of the United States (U.S.), including export sales from U.S. business locations, accounted for approximately 70% of our revenue in fiscal year 2017. Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in foreign countries. These risks include, but are not limited to:. • exposure to the risk of currency value fluctuations, where payment for products is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars;. • variability in the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated assets, earnings and cash flows;. • difficulty enforcing agreements, including patent and trademarks, and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;. • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;. • tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S. and the imposition of withholding requirements on foreign earnings;. • higher danger of terrorist activity, war or civil unrest compared to domestic operations;. • imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;. • difficulty in staffing and managing global operations;. • required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act applicable to our international operations, and significant compliance costs and penalties for failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations; and. • changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets.. Volatility in the global economy could adversely affect results.. Long-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets would likely adversely affect our customers' operations and financing of both our international and U.S. customers and could therefore result in a decrease in orders and revenue. In addition, during periods of economic uncertainty, our customers' spending patterns and financing availability could be negatively impacted, reducing demand for our products and services.. 6. Table of Contents. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results.. Although our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a large portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in Euros, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan and other foreign currencies. Our profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against these currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses. To the extent that we are unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations in any such currency could have an adverse effect on financial results. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported sales and earnings from our international operations will be lower because the applicable local currency will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular, a significant change in the relative values of the U.S. dollar, Euro, Japanese yen or Chinese yuan, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition given that approximately 70% of our revenue has historically been derived from customers outside of the U.S. Additionally, there has been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdom's referendum held on June 23, 2016 in which British voters approved the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. As further described in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, revenue for fiscal year 2017 was negatively impacted by currency translation.. Our business is subject to strong competition.. Our products are sold in competitive markets throughout the world. Competition is based on application knowledge, product features and design, brand recognition, reliability, technology, breadth of product offerings, price, delivery, customer relationships and after-market support. If we are not perceived as competitive in overall value as measured by these criteria, our customers would likely choose solutions offered by our competitors or developed internally.. Our business is subject to customer demand cycles.. For many of our products, orders are subject to customers' procurement cycles and their willingness and ability to invest in capital, especially in the cyclical automotive, aircraft and machine tool industries. Any event that adversely impacts those customers' new product development activities may reduce their demand for our products.. We may experience difficulty obtaining materials or components for our products, or the cost of materials or components may increase.. We purchase materials and components from third-party suppliers, some of whom may be competitors. Other materials and components may be provided by a limited number of suppliers or by sole sources and could only be replaced with difficulty or at significant added cost. Additionally, some materials or components may become scarce or difficult to obtain in the market or they may increase in price. This could adversely affect the lead time within which we receive the materials or components, and in turn affect our commitments to our customers, or could adversely affect the cost or quality of materials.. Our level of indebtedness and interest rate fluctuations on that indebtedness could adversely affect our business and results of operations and may require the use of our available cash resources to meet repayment obligations, which could reduce the cash available for other purposes.. We have a senior secured credit facility that provides for a $120,000 revolving credit facility and a $455,400 tranche B term loan facility, both of which require that we pay a variable interest rate on outstanding borrowings. The debt under the tranche B term loan facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount and matures on July 5, 2023. As of September 30, 2017, we did not have any borrowings under the revolving credit facility; however, we may, at times, use debt under the revolving credit facility to purchase shares of our common stock, finance working capital needs or continue to finance the growth of the business through acquisitions.. Our level of indebtedness may place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged. Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs. We hedge against a portion of the risk on the term facility by swapping the variable rate for a fixed rate. Increases in interest rates may directly impact the amount of interest we are required to pay and reduce earnings accordingly. In addition, developments in tax policy, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for interest paid on outstanding indebtedness, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. Further, our senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing our tangible equity units contain customary affirmative and negative covenants and certain restrictions on operations that could impose operating and financial limitations and restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to enter into particular transactions and to engage in other actions that we may believe are advisable or necessary for our business. The loans under our term facility are also subject to mandatory prepayments in certain circumstances and require a prepayment of a certain percentage of our excess cash flow beginning in fiscal year 2018. We anticipate a significant payment will be due in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 based on fiscal year 2017 results. This excess cash flow payment, and future required prepayments, will reduce our cash available for other purposes and could impact our ability to reinvest in other areas of our business.. 7. Table of Contents. Our outstanding 8.75% tangible equity units (TEUs) may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.. The market price of our common stock may be influenced by the outstanding TEUs sold in our June 2016 public offering. For example, additional shares of our common stock are currently and will continue to be issuable upon settlement of the purchase contract component of the tangible equity units through expiration on July 1, 2019. The settlement rates for such purchase contracts are subject to certain anti-dilution and make-whole adjustments that could increase, potentially significantly, the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon such settlement. As a result, the market price of our common stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by the following factors:. • investors' anticipation of the sale into the market of a substantial number of additional shares of common stock received upon settlement of the purchase contract component of the tangible equity units;. • possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the tangible equity units as a more attractive means of equity participation in the Company than owning shares of our common stock; and. • hedging or arbitrage trading activities that may develop involving the tangible equity units, the purchase contracts and our common stock.. In addition, our debt obligations under the senior amortizing note component of the tangible equity units may further influence the market price of our common stock, including but not limited to our ability to make timely payments to holders of the notes.. As a result of the delayed filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended October 1, 2016 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended December 31, 2016 with the SEC, we are not currently eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale of securities, which may adversely affect our ability to raise future capital in a timely manner or complete acquisitions.. We are not currently eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3 and we will not become eligible until we have timely filed certain periodic reports required under the Exchange Act for 12 consecutive calendar months, which will not be met until February 9, 2018 at the earliest. There can be no assurance when we will meet this requirement, which depends in part upon our ability to file our periodic reports on a timely basis in the future. Should we wish to register the offer and sale of our securities to the public before we are eligible to do so using Form S-3, our transaction costs and the amount of time required to complete the transaction could increase, making it more difficult to execute any such transaction successfully and potentially having an adverse effect on our financial condition.. Operational Risks. We identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in fiscal years 2016 and 2015 which were subsequently remediated. If additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are identified in the future, or if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which could adversely affect our stock price and negatively impact our results of operations.. We previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, as discussed in Controls and Procedures included Item 9A of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2016, respectively. These material weaknesses were remediated, and management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2017.. Future testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may identify deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting. Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. The existence of a material weakness could cause our consolidated financial results to contain material misstatements, require prospective or retrospective changes to our consolidated financial statements, lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock, cause us to incur unforeseen costs, subject us to investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, damage our reputation or have other potentially material adverse consequences.. 8. Table of Contents. We plan to reorganize the Test business structure, processes and operating systems, which may not deliver the results we require for growth of the business.. We continue to invest in our Test operating model and modify our business processes and systems. Given the growth in demand and sophistication of testing needs across the primary markets served, on January 5, 2017, we announced that we plan to divide Test into two separate business units, \"Materials Test Systems\" and \"Vehicles and Structure Test Systems.\" We anticipate that the division of our Test segment will result in us having three operating segments once discrete financial information is made available to our Chief Operating Decision Maker. We will continue to report only the Test and Sensors segments until such time. We continue to evaluate the timing of such implementation.. When the planned Test business structure reorganization is complete, the focus of the \"Materials Test Systems\" business unit will be on providing test solutions to global customers involved in developing and manufacturing advanced materials that are essential to biomedical, energy, automotive and aerospace applications. The \"Vehicles and Structures Test Systems\" business unit will focus on providing test solutions to automotive, aerospace, infrastructure and energy markets worldwide. We plan to restructure the Test business to make it a more scalable business model in the markets that we currently serve. Successful implementation of these initiatives is critical to the growth of our business. The execution of the reorganization of the Test business structure may have limited success or no success at all and may be negatively impacted if we are unable to hire leadership and key personnel for each of the Test business units.. We may not realize the growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from our acquisition of PCB.. The benefits that are expected to result from our July 5, 2016 acquisition of PCB, the largest acquisition in our history, will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies that result from the acquisition. Our success in realizing these growth opportunities and cost synergies, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of PCB. There is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition as sizable as PCB. The process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, our and PCB's activities. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage other aspects of the Company, service existing customers, attract new customers and develop new products or strategies. If senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer. There can be no assurance that we will successfully or cost-effectively integrate PCB. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.. Even if we are able to integrate PCB successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and cost synergies that we currently expect from this integration, and we cannot guarantee that these benefits will be achieved within anticipated timeframes or at all. For example, we may not be able to eliminate duplicative costs. Moreover, we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of PCB, and such expenses may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. While it is anticipated that certain expenses will be incurred to achieve cost synergies, such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately, and may exceed current estimates. Accordingly, the benefits from the acquisition may be offset by costs incurred related to, or delays in, integrating the businesses.. PCB may have liabilities that are not known, probable or estimable at this time and we may become subject to additional risks and uncertainties relating to PCB and its business.. Upon completion of the acquisition of PCB, PCB became our wholly owned subsidiary and, as a result, we became subject to all of its liabilities. There could be unasserted claims or assessments that we failed or were unable to discover or identify in the course of performing our due diligence investigation of PCB. In addition, there may be liabilities that are neither probable nor estimable at this time that may become probable or estimable in the future. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and our ability to make an indemnity claim against the sellers of PCB will be limited after the release of the escrow, which is anticipated in early calendar 2018. We may learn additional information about PCB that adversely affects us, such as unknown, unasserted or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws.. In addition, we may become subject to additional risks associated with PCB and its business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming, as PCB was not previously operating as a public company. The difficulties of integrating the businesses include, among others:. • failure to implement our business plan for the combined business;. • unanticipated issues in integrating equipment, logistics, information, communications and other systems;. • possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, contracts, procedures and policies;. • impacts of change in control provisions in contracts and agreements;. 9. Table of Contents. • failure to retain key customers and suppliers;. • unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;. • failure to recruit and retain key employees to operate the combined business;. • increased competition within the industries in which PCB operates;. • inherent operating risks in the business;. • unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities;. • additional reporting requirements pursuant to applicable rules and regulations; and. • additional requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting.. Our business operations may be affected by government contracting risks.. Government business is important to us and is expected to increase in the future. Revenue from U.S. Government contracts varies by year. Such revenue as a percent of our total revenue was 4%, 3% and 3% for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.. We must comply with procurement laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting and result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. Failure to comply could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to secure future U.S. Government contracts and export control licenses, and our results of operations or financial condition. These laws and regulations also create compliance risks and affect how we do business with federal agency clients. U.S. Government contracts, as well as contracts with certain foreign governments with which we do business, are also subject to modification or termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. Further, any investigation relating to, or suspension or debarment from, U.S. Government contracting could have a material impact on our results of operations as, during the duration of any suspension or debarment, we would be prohibited or otherwise limited in our ability to enter into prime contracts or subcontracts with U.S. Government agencies, certain entities that receive U.S. Government funds or that are otherwise subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and certain state government or commercial customers who decline to contract with suspended or debarred entities. A federal suspension could also impact our ability to obtain export control licenses which are materially important to our business.. We are subject to risks because we design and manufacture first-of-a-kind products.. We design and build systems that are unique and innovative and, in some cases, the first created to address complex and unresolved issues. The design, manufacture and support of these systems may involve higher than planned costs. If we are unable to meet our customers' expectations, our reputation and ability to further utilize our expertise will likely be damaged.. The backlog, sales, delivery and acceptance cycle for many of our products is irregular and may not develop as anticipated.. Many of our products have long sales, delivery and acceptance cycles. In addition, our backlog is subject to order cancellations and our sales arrangements typically do not include specific cancellation provisions. If an order is canceled, we typically would only be entitled to receive reimbursement from the customer for actual costs incurred under the arrangement plus a reasonable margin. Events may cause recognition of orders, backlog and results of operations to be irregular over shorter periods of time. These factors include the timing of individual large orders which may be impacted by interest rates, customer capital spending and product development cycles, design and manufacturing problems, capacity constraints, delays in product readiness, damage or delays in transit, problems in achieving technical performance requirements, and various customer-initiated delays. Any such delay or any cancellations may cause fluctuations in our reported periodic financial results and may cause our stated conversion to revenue to be inaccurate.. The business could be adversely affected by product liability and commercial litigation.. Our products or services may be claimed to cause or contribute to personal injury or property damage to our customers' facilities. Additionally, we are, at times, involved in commercial disputes with third parties, such as customers, vendors and others. The ensuing claims may arise singularly, in groups of related claims or in class actions involving multiple claimants. Such claims and litigation are frequently expensive and time consuming to resolve and may result in substantial liability to us, and any liability and related costs and expenses may not be recoverable through insurance or other forms of reimbursement.. We may experience difficulties obtaining and retaining the services of skilled employees.. We rely on knowledgeable, experienced and skilled technical personnel, particularly engineers, sales management and service personnel, to design, assemble, sell and service our products. We may be unable to attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of such people which could adversely affect our business. The inability to transfer knowledge and transition between roles within these teams could also adversely affect our business.. 10. Table of Contents. We may fail to protect our intellectual property effectively or may infringe upon the intellectual property of others.. We have developed significant proprietary technology and other rights that are used in our businesses. We rely on trade secret, copyright, trademark and patent laws and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. While we take enforcement of these rights seriously, other companies such as competitors or others in markets in which we do not participate may attempt to copy or use our intellectual property for their own benefit.. In addition, the intellectual property of others also has an impact on our ability to offer some of our products and services for specific uses or at competitive prices. Competitors' patents or other intellectual property may limit our ability to offer products and services to our customers. Any infringement on the intellectual property rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide, or could increase the cost of providing, our products and services.. Intellectual property litigation can be very costly and could result in substantial expense and diversion of our resources, both of which could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and results. In addition, there may be no effective legal recourse against infringement of our intellectual property by third parties, whether due to limitations on enforcement of rights in foreign jurisdictions or as a result of other factors.. If we are unable to protect our information systems against misappropriation of data or breaches of security, our business operations and financial results could be adversely impacted. Evolving regulations and legal obligations related to data privacy, data protection and information security and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could have an adverse effect on our business.. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of cyber attacks. Although we strive to have appropriate security controls in place, prevention of security breaches cannot be assured, particularly as cyber threats continue to evolve. We may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our security measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. The consequences of these risks could adversely impact our business operations and financial results.. In addition, our handling of certain data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, which have been adopted by various federal, state and foreign governments to regulate the collection, distribution, use and storage of personal information of individuals. Several foreign countries in which we conduct business, including the European Economic Area (EEA), currently have in place, or have recently proposed, laws or regulations concerning privacy, data protection and information security, which are more restrictive than those imposed in the United States. Some of these laws are in their early stages and we cannot yet determine the impact these revised laws and regulations, if implemented, may have on our business. However, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with these privacy laws, regulations, policies or obligations or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other customer data in our possession, could result in government enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties and/or adverse publicity, all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. For example, the new EEA-wide General Data Protection Regulation will become effective in our fiscal year 2018 and will replace the data protection laws of each EEA member state. If our privacy or data security measures fail to comply with applicable current or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations and enforcement notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data.. Government regulation imposes costs and other constraints.. Our manufacturing operations and past and present ownership and operations of real property are subject to extensive and changing federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations pertaining to health and safety matters, as well as the handling or discharge of hazardous materials into the environment. We expect to continue to incur costs to comply with these laws and may incur penalties for any failure to do so. We may also be identified as a responsible party and be subject to liability relating to any investigation and cleanup of properties used for industrial purposes or the generation or disposal of hazardous substances. In addition, some of our products contain hazardous substances and are subject to requirements that regulate their content, such as the European Union's Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive and analogous regulations elsewhere.. Some of our export sales require approval from the U.S. government. Changes in political relations between the U.S. and foreign countries and/or specific potential customers for which export licenses may be required, may cause a license application to be delayed or denied, or a previously issued license withdrawn, rendering us unable to complete a sale or vulnerable to competitors who do not operate under such restrictions. Capital expenditures for environmental compliance were immaterial in fiscal year 2017, and we do not expect such expenditures will be material in fiscal year 2018; however, the factors described above may cause our estimates to differ from our expectations.. 11. Table of Contents. We have been required to conduct a good faith reasonable country of origin analysis on our use of conflict minerals, which has imposed and may impose additional costs on us and could raise reputational and other risks.. The SEC has promulgated final rules in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. While there is pending litigation challenging these rules, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. We have adopted a policy relating to conflict minerals, incorporating the standards set forth in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidance, which affects the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. As we continue our due diligence, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products through the procedures we have and may continue to implement. We may also encounter challenges in our efforts to satisfy customers that may require all of the components of products purchased to be certified as conflict-free. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier.. We may not achieve our growth plans for the expansion of the business.. In addition to market penetration, our long-term success depends on our ability to expand our business through (a) new product development and service offerings; (b) mergers and acquisitions; and/or (c) geographic expansion.. New product development and service offerings require that we maintain our ability to improve existing products, continue to bring innovative products and services to market in a timely fashion and adapt products and services to the needs and standards of current and potential customers. Our products and services may become less competitive or eclipsed by technologies to which we do not have access or which render our solutions obsolete.. Mergers and acquisitions will be accompanied by risks that may include:. • suitable candidates may not exist or may not be available at acceptable costs;. • failure to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;. • difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses;. • disruption of ongoing business and distraction of management from the ongoing business;. • dilution of existing shareholders and earnings per share;. • unanticipated, undisclosed or inaccurately assessed liabilities, legal risks and costs; and. • difficulties retaining the key vendors, customers or employees of the acquired business.. Acquisitions of businesses having a significant presence outside the U.S. will increase our exposure to the risks of international operations discussed in the operational risk factors.. Geographic expansion may be outside of the U.S., and hence will be disproportionately subject to the risks of international operations discussed in the operational risk factors.. We may be required to recognize impairment charges for goodwill and long-lived assets.. As of September 30, 2017, the net carrying value of goodwill and long-lived assets (property and equipment, net and intangible assets, net) totaled $724,771. We periodically assess the value of these assets for impairment in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our businesses, significant unexpected or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other long-lived assets. Future impairment charges could significantly affect reported financial results.. We cannot guarantee that we will not record a material goodwill impairment charge in the future for the PCB reporting unit. Changes in our assumptions or estimates could materially affect the estimation of fair value of the PCB reporting unit and, therefore, could reduce the excess of fair value over the carrying value of the PCB reporting unit entirely resulting in goodwill impairment. Events and conditions that could negatively impact the estimated fair value include a sustained decline in our stock price, inability to realize the anticipated sales growth opportunities as a result of the PCB acquisition, unsuccessful integration of PCB, lack of development of new products and a decrease in projected profitability.. Our investigation during fiscal year 2017 relating to our China operations and our failure to maintain effective processes and controls relative to adherence to our Code of Conduct by employees involved with our business in China during fiscal year 2016 may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we announced the initiation of an internal investigation into apparent violations of our Code of Conduct involving certain employees in our China operations, including association by those employees with an independent business that may compete with us in certain markets. As the apparent violations implicated members of leadership in our China operations, the Audit Committee engaged independent external counsel to conduct an investigation of. 12. Table of Contents. our China operations in order to assess the impact of these apparent violations on the Company's financial input from China and to review for potential violations the Company's Code of Conduct, anticorruption compliance policies and procedures and related U.S. law. Independent forensic accountants, acting at the direction of external counsel, performed testing of certain transactions related to our China operations as part of this investigation. As of September 30, 2017, investigative work was completed and confirmed that the former China Test leader and several other former senior managers associated with our China Test operations violated the conflict of interest provisions of our Code of Conduct in connection with their involvement with an independent business that competed with the Company's low-end products in the China market. This inconsistent adherence to our Code of Conduct could have resulted in management override of internal control over financial reporting.. Our Code of Conduct and other internal policies prohibit us and our employees from engaging in unethical business practices. However, there can be no assurance that all of our employees or agents will refrain from acting in violation of such policies and procedures or that our processes and controls will be sufficient to detect any such violations. The investigation into potential violations of these policies, or even allegations of such violations, and evaluation of our internal controls, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction, and lead to significant costs and expenses, including legal and accounting fees and such expenses may have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Further, if our employees or agents violate such policies and procedures, such actions could result in management override of internal controls over financial reporting. If we, or our employees or agents acting on our behalf, are found to have engaged in practices that violate these policies and/or applicable law, we could suffer severe fines and penalties, repayment of ill-gotten gains, injunctions on future conduct, securities litigation, material weaknesses in our financial reporting and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, including but not limited to our operations in China. In addition, our reputation, sales activities or stock price could be adversely affected if we become the subject of any negative publicity related to actual or potential violations of applicable laws and regulations."
