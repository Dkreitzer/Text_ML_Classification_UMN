[1] "Item 1A.  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk Factors.. An investment in our company involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information included in this report, you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating an investment in our company. You should consider these matters in conjunction with the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. Our results of operations or financial condition could be seriously harmed, and the trading price of our common stock may decline due to any of these or other risks.. General economic and political conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic and political conditions and their impact on levels of capital investment and government spending. Global economic and political uncertainties and foreign currency rate fluctuations could adversely influence demand for our products leading to reduced levels of investments, reductions in government spending and budgets and changes in spending priorities and behavior.. We may need additional capital for growth.. We may need additional capital to support our growth. While we expect to generate these funds from operations, we may not be able to do so. Principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure of sales to government, military and commercial markets to meet planned projections;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgovernment spending levels impacting sales of our products;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical uncertainty;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforeign currency fluctuations;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tworking capital requirements to support business growth;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to control spending;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tintroduction of new competing technologies;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct mix and effect on margins; and. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacceptance of our existing and future products in existing and new markets.. Should we require additional funds, general market conditions or the then-current market price of our common stock may not support capital raising transactions and any such financing may require advance approval of our stockholders under the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market. Our ability to obtain financing may be further constrained by prevailing economic conditions. We may be required to reduce costs, including the scaling back of research and development into new products, which could have a negative impact on our ability to compete and to innovate. If we raise additional funds by selling additional shares of our capital stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock (assuming we are able to obtain additional financing), the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, which could have a material negative impact on the market value of our common stock.. We have historically had a high concentration of revenues from a limited number of customers. We expect to continue to be dependent on a limited number of customers.. In fiscal year 2017, we did not have any customers that accounted for more than 15% of revenues, which shows improved diversification of our customer base. Historically, our revenues have been dependent upon a limited number of customers and we expect that we will continue to have some significant customers in future years. We do not have long-term purchase commitments with these or other significant customers, and our customers have the right to cease doing business with us at any time. Military contracts that we have been awarded have terms of indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity during the term of the contract, so there are no guaranteed purchases on these contracts. No assurance can be given that these or other customers will continue to do business with us or that they will maintain their historical levels of business. If our relationship with any material customer were to cease, then our revenues would decline and negatively impact our results of operations. Any such decline could result in us increasing our accumulated deficit and a need to raise additional capital to fund our operations. If our expectations regarding future sales are inaccurate, we may be unable to reduce costs in a timely manner to adjust for sales shortfalls.. 8. Disruption and fluctuations in financial and currency markets could have a negative effect on our business.. Financial markets in the U.S., Europe and Asia have experienced extreme volatility and uncertainty in recent years. Governments have taken unprecedented actions intended to address these market conditions. It is difficult to assess the extent to which these conditions have impacted our business, and the affect this has had on certain of our customers and suppliers. These economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. The tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of commercial customers to finance purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in orders and spending for our products as well as create supplier disruptions. Reductions in tax revenues, rating downgrades and other economic developments could also reduce future government spending on our products. There can be no assurance that there will not be a further volatility and uncertainty in financial markets, which can then lead to challenges in the operation of our business. We are unable to predict the likely effects that negative economic conditions will have on our business and financial condition.. We purchase a number of key components and sub-assemblies from foreign suppliers. Consequently, we are subject to the impact economic conditions can have on such suppliers and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases in our cost of purchasing these items could negatively impact our financial results if we are not able to pass these increased costs on to our customers.. We have current government contracts and our future growth is dependent, in large part, on continued sales to U.S. and international governments and businesses that sell to governments.. In fiscal year 2017, direct and indirect sales to the U.S. government accounted for approximately 15% of our total net sales, compared to 31% of our total net sales in fiscal year 2016 and 20% in fiscal year 2015. Changes in defense spending could have an adverse effect on our current and future revenues. Sales of our products to U.S. government agencies and organizations are subject to the overall U.S. government budget and congressional appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events and macroeconomic conditions, and are beyond our control. Reduced U.S. Department of Defense spending in recent years, including sequestration spending cuts, could affect future U.S. Department of Defense military initiatives and homeland security spending. Even awards granted, such as our $7.4 million contract from the U.S. Navy awarded in March 2016, may not have orders issued against it due to spending constraints. Similar issues apply to sales to international governments. We have no assurance that military interest in communication devices to minimize unnecessary force will continue or will provide future growth opportunities for our business.. We must expand our customer base in order to grow our business.. To grow our business, in addition to continuing to obtain additional orders from our existing customers, we must develop relationships with new customers and obtain and fulfill orders from new customers. We are competing against a number of large competitors in the mass notification market, and we need to establish our omnidirectional products as a viable competitor in this market to allow us to win awards against these competitors, increase our customer base and gain market share. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase our customer base. Further, even if we do obtain new customers, we cannot guarantee that those customers will purchase from us enough quantities of our product or at product prices that will enable us to recover our costs in acquiring those customers and fulfilling those orders. Whether we will be able to sell more of our products will depend on a number of factors, including:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to design and manufacture reliable products that have the features that are required by our customers;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe global economy;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to expand relationships with existing customers and to develop relationships with new customers that will lead to additional orders for our products;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to develop and expand new markets for directed sound products; and. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to develop international product distribution directly or through strategic partners.. We may not be able to successfully integrate businesses we may acquire in the future, and we may not be able to realize anticipated cost savings, revenue enhancements, or other synergies from such acquisitions.. Our ability to successfully implement our business plan and achieve targeted financial results and other benefits including, among other things, greater market presence and development, and enhancements to our product portfolio and customer base, is dependent on our ability to successfully integrate businesses we may acquire in the future. We may not realize the intended benefits, as rapidly as, or to the extent, anticipated by our management. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, products or technologies without substantial expenses, delays or other operational or financial problems. Acquisitions involve a number of risks, some or all which could have a material adverse effect on our acquired businesses, products or technologies. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any acquired business, product, or technology will be profitable or achieve anticipated revenues and income. Our failure to manage our acquisition strategy successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The process of integrating an acquired business involves risks, including but not limited to:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdemands on management related to changes in the size and possible locations of our businesses and employees;. 9. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiversion of management's attention from the management of daily operations;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures, employees and business practices;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties in conforming the acquired businesses’ accounting policies to ours;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tretaining the loyalty and business of the employees or customers of acquired businesses;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tretaining employees that may be vital to the integration of acquired businesses or to the future prospects of the combined businesses;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties and unanticipated expenses related to the integration of departments, information technology systems, including accounting systems, technologies, books and records, and procedures, and maintaining uniform standards, such as internal accounting controls, procedures, and policies;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcosts and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe use of more cash or other financial resources on integration and implementation activities than we expect; and. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to avoid labor disruptions in connection with any integration, particularly in connection with any headcount reduction.. Failure to successfully integrate any acquired businesses in the future may result in reduced levels of anticipated revenue, earnings, or operating efficiency than might have been achieved if we had not acquired such businesses.. In addition, any future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense, contingent liabilities, and amortization expenses related to intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results, and cash flow.. The growth of our LRAD product revenues is dependent on continued acceptance of our products by government, military and developing force protection and emergency response agencies. If these agencies do not purchase our LRAD products, our revenues will be adversely affected.. Although our LRAD products are designed for use by both government and commercial customers, the government market represents a significant revenue opportunity for our products. Revenues from government agencies, including military, force protection and emergency response agencies, fluctuate each year depending on available funding and demand from our government customers. While acceptance of our products has been increasing, there are many more prospective customers within this market that could provide future growth for us, as well as international government markets which often follow the lead of the U.S. Furthermore, the force protection and emergency response market is itself an emerging market that is changing rapidly. If our LRAD products are not widely accepted by the government, military and the developing force protection and emergency response markets, we may not be able to identify other markets, and we may fail to achieve our sales projections.. Perceptions that long-range hailing devices are unsafe or may be used in an abusive manner may hurt sales of our LRAD products, which could cause our revenues to decline.. Potential customers for our LRAD products, including government, military and force protection and emergency response agencies, may be influenced by claims or perceptions that long-range hailing devices are unsafe or may be used in an abusive manner. These claims or perceptions, while unsubstantiated, could reduce our product sales.. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our core product category.. We are dependent on our core directional product category to generate our revenues. While we have expanded our product offering to include omnidirectional products, no assurance can be given that our core directional products will continue to have market acceptance or that they will maintain their historical levels of sales. The loss or reduction of sales of this product category could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.. We may not be successful in penetrating the mass notification market.. The mass notification market is substantial in size and is projecting growth over the next five years to help provide public safety and communication during natural disasters and emergency situations. There are a number of large, credible companies already established in this market. We believe the clear, intelligible voice capability of our LRAD products, and our unique design and durability make our product offerings very competitive in this market. We have added selling resources to focus on this market and we have invested and plan to invest additional resources in tooling and software development to become successful in this market. However, we are competing in a market with established competitors that have greater resources and presence in this global market.. 10. Our margins could be impacted as we expand into the mass notification market.. Our sales strategy for fiscal year 2018 and beyond is to increase our market share of the growing mass notification market with our omnidirectional products. A number of large companies compete in this market and dominate the market share. We believe we have a strong product that can successfully compete against these larger players, but we expect to confront pricing pressures, given this highly competitive environment, which may negatively impact our overall margins.. We may incur significant and unpredictable warranty costs.. Our products are substantially different from proven, mass produced sound transducer designs and are often employed in harsh environments. We may incur substantial and unpredictable warranty costs from post-production product or component failures. We generally warrant our products to be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period up to one year from the date of purchase. We also sell extended repair and maintenance contracts with terms ranging from one to several years, which provide repair and maintenance services after expiration of the original limited warranty. At September 30, 2017, we had a warranty reserve of $179,101. While our warranty experience with our LRAD product line has been favorable, as we build more complexity into the product, and as we expand our supplier base, issues could arise that could affect future warranty costs, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and business prospects.. System disruptions and security threats to our computer networks, including breach of our or our customers’ confidential information, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation.. Our computer systems as well as those of our service providers are vulnerable to interruption, malfunction or damage due to events beyond our control, including malicious human acts committed by foreign or domestic persons, natural disasters, and network and communications failures. We periodically perform vulnerability self-assessments and engage service providers to perform independent vulnerability assessments and penetration tests. However, despite network security measures, our servers and the servers at our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, organized cyber attacks and other security problems and system disruptions. Increasing socioeconomic and political instability in some countries has heightened these risks. Despite the precautions we and our service providers have taken, our systems may still be vulnerable to these threats. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations.. Additionally, the confidential information that we collect subjects us to additional risks and costs that could harm our business and our reputation. We collect, retain and use personal information of our employees, including personally identifiable information, tax return information, financial data, bank account information and other data. Although we employ various network and business security measures to limit access to and use of such personal information, we cannot guarantee that a third party will not circumvent such security measures, resulting in the breach, loss or theft of the personal information of our employees. Possession and use of personal information in our operations also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could restrict our use of personal information and require notification of data breaches. A violation of any laws or regulations relating to the collection, retention or use of personal information could also result in the imposition of fines or lawsuits against us.. Sustained or repeated system failures or security breaches that interrupt our ability to process information in a timely manner or that result in a breach of proprietary or personal information could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our reputation. Although we maintain insurance in respect of these types of events, available insurance proceeds may not be adequate to compensate us for damages sustained due to these events.. We could incur additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory.. While we strive to effectively manage our inventory, rapidly changing technology, and uneven customer demand may result in short product cycles and the value of our inventory may be adversely affected by changes in technology that affect our ability to sell the products in our inventory. If we do not effectively forecast and manage our inventory, we may need to write off inventory as excess or obsolete, which in turn can adversely affect cost of sales and gross profit.. We have previously experienced, and may in the future experience, reductions in sales of older generation products as customers delay or defer purchases in anticipation of new product introductions. We currently have established reserves for slow moving or obsolete inventory of $418,532. The reserves we have established for potential losses due to obsolete inventory may, however, prove to be inadequate and may give rise to additional charges for obsolete or excess inventory.. We do not have the ability to accurately predict future operating results. Our quarterly and annual revenues are likely to fluctuate significantly due to many factors, most of which are beyond our control and could result in our failure to achieve our revenue expectations.. We expect our proprietary directed and omnidirectional acoustic products and technologies will be the source of substantially all our revenues for at least the near future. Revenues from these products and technologies are expected to vary significantly due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Any one or more of the factors listed below or other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our revenue expectations. These factors include:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to develop and supply sound reproduction components to customers, distributors or original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) or to license our technologies;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmarket acceptance of and changes in demand for our products or products of our customers;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgains or losses of significant customers, distributors or strategic relationships;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunpredictable volume and timing of customer orders;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelays in funding approval by U.S. and foreign government and military customers;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components for our products and OEM products;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or manufacturing yields and related manufacturing costs;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing of new technological advances, product announcements or introductions by us, by OEMs or licensees and by our competitors;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduction delays by customers, distributors, OEMs, or by us or our suppliers;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased competition in this market;. 11. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe conditions of other industries, such as military and commercial industries, into which our technologies may be sold;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral electronics industry conditions, including changes in demand and associated effects on inventory and inventory practices;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic conditions that could affect the timing of customer orders and capital spending and result in order cancellations or rescheduling; and. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral political conditions in this country and in various other parts of the world that could affect spending for the products that we offer.. Some or all of these factors could adversely affect demand for our products or technologies, and therefore adversely affect our future operating results.. Most of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term. We may be unable to rapidly adjust spending to compensate for any unexpected sales shortfalls, which could harm our quarterly operating results. We do not have the ability to predict future operating results with any certainty.. Many potential competitors who have greater resources and experience than we do may develop products and technologies that make ours obsolete or inferior.. Technological competition from larger, more established electronic and loudspeaker manufacturers is expected to increase. Most of the companies with which we expect to compete have substantially greater capital resources, research and development staffs, marketing and distribution programs and facilities, and many of them have substantially greater experience in the production and marketing of products. In addition, one or more of our competitors may have developed or may succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any of ours, rendering our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive.. Adverse resolution of disputes, litigation and claims may harm our business, operating results or financial condition.. We may become a party to other litigation, disputes and claims in the normal course of our business. Litigation is by its nature uncertain and unpredictable and there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of such claims will not exceed the amounts accrued for such claims, if any. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. An unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.. Our competitive position will be seriously damaged if we cannot protect intellectual property rights and trade secrets in our technology.. We rely on a combination of contracts, trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. However, we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property, and our competitors may be able to independently develop competing technologies, or the agreements we enter into may not be enforceable. A competitor may independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent to, or superior to, our technology. If this happens, our competitive position could be significantly harmed.. We may face personal injury and other liability claims that harm our reputation and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.. While our products have been engineered to reduce the risk of damage to human hearing or human health, we could be exposed to claims of hearing damage if the product is not properly operated. A person injured in connection with the use of our products may bring legal action against us to recover damages on the basis of theories including personal injury, negligent design, dangerous product or inadequate warning. We may also be subject to lawsuits involving allegations of misuse of our products. Our product liability insurance coverage may be insufficient to pay all such claims. Product liability insurance may also become too costly for us or may become unavailable for us in the future. We may not have sufficient resources to satisfy any product liability claims not covered by insurance which would materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Significant litigation could also result in negative publicity and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.. Our international operations could be harmed by factors including political instability, natural disasters, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and changes in regulations that govern international transactions.. We sell our products worldwide. In fiscal years 2017 and 2016, revenues outside of the U.S. accounted for approximately 64% and 62% of net revenues, respectively. The risks inherent in international trade may reduce our international sales and harm our business and the businesses of our customers and our suppliers. These risks include:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in tariff regulations;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical instability, war, terrorism and other political risks;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablishing and maintaining relationships with local distributors and dealers;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlengthy shipping times and accounts receivable payment cycles;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timport and export control and licensing requirements;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompliance with a variety of U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, by us or key subcontractors;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, including unexpected changes in taxation and regulatory requirements;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgreater difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property than in the U.S.; and. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations.. 12. These and other risks may preclude or curtail international sales or increase the relative price of our products compared to those manufactured in other countries, reducing the demand for our products. Failure to comply with U.S. and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to international business, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or U.S. export control regulations, could have an adverse impact on our business with the U.S. and foreign governments.. Current environmental laws, or laws enacted in the future, may harm our business.. Our operations are subject to environmental regulation in areas in which we conduct business. Our product design and procurement operations must comply with new and future requirements relating to the materials composition of our products, including restrictions on lead, cadmium and other substances. We do not expect that the impact of these environmental laws and other similar legislation adopted in the U.S. and other countries will have a substantial unfavorable impact on our business. However, the costs and timing of costs under environmental laws are difficult to predict.. Errors or defects contained in our products, failure to comply with applicable safety standards or a product recall could result in delayed shipments or rejection of our products, damage to our reputation and expose us to regulatory or other legal action.. Any defects or errors in the operation of our products may result in delays in their introduction. In addition, errors or defects may be uncovered after commercial shipments have begun, which could result in the rejection of our products by our customers, damage to our reputation, lost sales, diverted development resources and increased customer service and support costs and warranty claims, any of which could harm our business. Third parties could sustain injuries from our products, and we may be subject to claims or lawsuits resulting from such injuries. There is a risk that these claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside the scope of, our insurance coverage. We may also be unable to obtain adequate liability insurance in the future. Because we are a smaller company, a product recall would be particularly harmful to us because we have limited financial and administrative resources to effectively manage a product recall and it would detract management’s attention from implementing our core business strategies. A significant product defect or product recall could materially and adversely affect our brand image, causing a decline in our sales, and could reduce or deplete our financial resources.. Costs associated with our multi-year maintenance contract with a foreign military customer could be higher than expected.. We are obligated under a seven-year repair and maintenance agreement with a foreign military customer to service $12.1 million of product sold in the quarter ended March 31, 2011. We have contracted with a third party service provider to administer the required services under the terms of the maintenance agreement. The revenue from the maintenance agreement with our customer is fixed and paid annually upon completion of each year of service for the seven-year period through 2019. It is possible that the cost to repair and maintain the products and the cost to contract with our third party service provider could exceed the revenue generated by the maintenance agreement.. We rely on outside manufacturers and suppliers to provide a large number of components and sub-assemblies incorporated in our products.. Our products have a large number of components and sub-assemblies produced by outside suppliers. In addition, for certain of these items, we qualify only a single source, which can magnify the risk of shortages and decrease our ability to negotiate with our suppliers on the basis of price. If shortages occur, or if we experience quality problems with suppliers, then our production schedules could be significantly delayed or costs significantly increased, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operation and financial position.. Although we assemble our products internally, we have some sub-assemblies and components produced by third party manufacturers. We may be required to outsource manufacturing if sales of our products increase significantly. We may be unable to obtain acceptable manufacturing sources on a timely basis. In addition, from time to time we may change manufacturers and any new manufacturer engaged by us may not perform as expected. An extended interruption in the supply of our products could result in a substantial loss of sales. Furthermore, any actual or perceived degradation of product quality as a result of our reliance on third party manufacturers may have an adverse effect on sales or result in increased warranty costs, product returns and buybacks. Failure to maintain quality manufacturing could reduce future revenues, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.. 13. We derive revenue from government contracts and subcontracts, which are often non-standard, may involve competitive bidding, may be subject to cancellation with or without penalty and may produce volatility in earnings and revenue.. Our sales to government customers have involved, and are expected in the future to involve, providing products and services under contracts or subcontracts with U.S. federal, state, local and foreign government agencies. Obtaining contracts and subcontracts from government agencies is challenging, and contracts often include provisions that are not standard in private commercial transactions. For example, government contracts may:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinclude provisions that allow the government agency to terminate the contract without penalty under some circumstances;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbe subject to purchasing decisions of agencies that are subject to political influence;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontain onerous procurement procedures; and. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbe subject to cancellation if government funding becomes unavailable.. Securing government contracts can be a protracted process involving competitive bidding. In many cases, unsuccessful bidders may challenge contract awards, which can lead to increased costs, delays and possible loss of the contract for the winning bidder.. Our success is dependent on the performance of our executive team, and the cooperation, performance and retention of our executive officers and key employees.. Our business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our current executive team including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. We do not maintain “key person” life insurance on any of our executive officers. The loss of one or several key employees could seriously harm our business. We cannot assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us.. We are also dependent on our ability to retain and motivate high quality personnel, especially sales and skilled engineering personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain other highly qualified managerial, sales and technical personnel in the future. The inability to attract and retain the necessary managerial, sales and technical personnel could cause our business, operating results or financial condition to suffer.. Our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all acts of fraud.. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Our management expects that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been prevented or detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by an unauthorized override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.. Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could harm stockholder and business confidence in our financial reporting, our ability to obtain financing and other aspects of our business.. Maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC require us to include in our Form 10-K a report by management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The report includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the respective fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. While our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2017, it is possible that material weaknesses will be identified in the future. In addition, components of our internal control over financial reporting may require improvement from time to time. If management is unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s stock price.. Our common stock could be delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market.. Nasdaq’s continued listing standards for our common stock require, among other things, that (i) we maintain a closing bid price for our common stock of at least $1.00, and (ii) we maintain: (A) stockholders’ equity of $2.5 million; (B) market value of listed securities of $35 million; or (C) net income from continuing operations of $500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the last three most recently completed fiscal years. Any failures to satisfy any continued listing requirements could lead to the receipt of a deficiency notice from Nasdaq and ultimately to a delisting from trading of our common stock. If our common stock were delisted from Nasdaq, among other things, this could result in a number of negative implications, including reduced liquidity in our common stock as a result of the loss of market efficiencies associated with Nasdaq and the loss of federal preemption of state securities laws as well as the potential loss of confidence by suppliers, customers and employees, institutional investor interest, fewer business development opportunities, greater difficulty in obtaining financing and breaches of certain contractual obligations.. 14. Sales of common stock issuable on the exercise of outstanding options, may depress the price of our common stock.. As of September 30, 2017, we had outstanding options granted to our employees and directors to purchase 4,663,502 shares of our common stock. At September 30, 2017, the exercise prices for the options ranged from $0.93 to $3.17 per share. The issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options could cause substantial dilution to holders of our common stock, and the sale of those shares in the market could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The potential dilution from these shares could negatively affect the terms on which we could obtain equity financing.. We may issue preferred stock in the future, and the terms of the preferred stock may reduce the value of your common stock.. We are authorized to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our board of directors may determine the terms of future preferred stock offerings without further action by our stockholders. If we issue additional preferred stock, it could affect the rights or reduce the value of our common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party. These terms may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, and sinking fund provisions.. Our stock price is volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future.. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly to date. In the future, the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to general market conditions and in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour anticipated or actual operating results;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelopments concerning our sound reproduction technologies;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttechnological innovations or setbacks by us or our competitors;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements of merger or acquisition transactions;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in personnel within our company; and. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother events or factors and general economic and market conditions.. The stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies, and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies.. Changes in laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies.. New laws, regulations and standards, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. This includes, among other things, compliance costs and enforcement under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd Frank Act”), XBRL interactive SEC filings, new SEC regulations and NASDAQ Stock Market rules. For example, under Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC has adopted additional disclosure requirements related to the source of certain “conflict minerals” for issuers for which such “conflict minerals” are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by that issuer. The metals covered by the rules include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, commonly referred to as “3TG.” Our suppliers may use some or all of these materials in their production processes. The rules require us to conduct a reasonable country of origin inquiry to determine if we know or have reason to believe any of the minerals used in the production process may have originated from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country. If we are not able to determine the minerals did not originate from a covered country or conclude that there is no reason to believe that the minerals used in the production process may have originated in a covered country, we would be required to perform supply chain due diligence on members of our supply chain. Global supply chains can have multiple layers, thus the costs of complying with these new requirements could be substantial. These new requirements may also reduce the number of suppliers who provide conflict free metals, and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Compliance costs and the unavailability of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.. We continually evaluate and monitor developments with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These new or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.. 15"
