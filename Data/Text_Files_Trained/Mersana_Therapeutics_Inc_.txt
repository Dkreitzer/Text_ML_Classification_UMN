[1] "ITEM 1A.           RISK FACTORS. The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.. Risks related to our financial position and need for additional capital. We have incurred net losses since our inception, we have no products approved for commercial sale and we anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future. We may never achieve or sustain profitability.. We have incurred net losses since our inception. Our net loss was $38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $97.9 million. We do not know when or whether we will become profitable. To date, we have not commercialized any products and therefore have never generated any revenues from the sale of products, and we do not expect to generate any product revenues in the foreseeable future. Our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in our discovery and development activities. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.. We have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development, including our clinical and preclinical development activities. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and the receipt of funds through strategic partnerships with third parties. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of our future expenditures. We have not completed pivotal clinical studies for any product candidate and only have two product candidates in clinical studies. It will be several years, if ever, before we have a product candidate ready for commercialization. Even if we obtain regulatory approval to market a product candidate, our future revenues would depend upon the size of the market or markets in which our product candidates received such approval and our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, reimbursement from third - party payors and adequate market share for our product candidates in those markets.. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing net losses for at least the next several years. We expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconduct clinical development of XMT - 1522, including our Phase 1 clinical study;. 38. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconduct clinical development of XMT-1536, including our Phase 1 clinical study;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tseek regulatory approval for XMT - 1522 and XMT - 1536;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadd personnel to support our product development efforts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontinue our research and development efforts for new product opportunities; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontinue to operate as a public company.. If we are required by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or any equivalent foreign regulatory authority to perform clinical studies or studies in addition to those we currently expect to conduct, or if there are any delays in completing the clinical studies of XMT - 1522 or XMT - 1536, our expenses could increase.. To become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing our ADC product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for them, and manufacturing, marketing and selling those products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We may not succeed in these activities, and we may never generate revenue from product sales or strategic partnerships in an amount sufficient to achieve profitability. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our failure to become or remain profitable would depress our market value and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, discover or develop other ADC product candidates or continue our operations.. We will require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts.. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $125.2 million as of December 31, 2017. We have utilized substantial amounts of cash since our inception and expect that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future developing XMT - 1522, XMT - 1536 and any future ADC product candidates. These expenditures may include costs associated with research and development, conducting preclinical studies and clinical studies, potentially obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing products, as well as marketing and selling products approved for sale, if any, and potentially acquiring new technologies. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. Because the outcome of our planned and anticipated clinical studies is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our ADC product candidates. Our costs will increase if we experience any delays in our clinical studies for XMT - 1522 or XMT - 1536, including delays in enrollment of patients. We also incur costs associated with operating as a public company, hiring additional personnel and expanding our facilities.. Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing XMT - 1522 and XMT - 1536 and any other potential ADC product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical studies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for XMT - 1522 and XMT - 1536 and any other potential ADC product candidates if preclinical studies and clinical studies are successful;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of manufacturing XMT - 1522 and XMT - 1536 and any other potential ADC product candidates for clinical studies in preparation for regulatory approval and in preparation for commercialization;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of commercialization activities for XMT - 1522 and XMT - 1536 and any other potential ADC product candidates, if any ADC product candidates are approved for sale, including manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution costs;. 39. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, our future products, if any, or products developed by our partners.. Based on our current operating plan, we estimate that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements through at least mid-2019 and to fund our Phase 1 clinical studies for XMT - 1522 and XMT - 1536. Our operating plan, however, may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us and we may need additional funds sooner than planned. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate preclinical studies, clinical studies or other development activities for one or more of our ADC product candidates or delay, limit, reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our ADC product candidates. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or ADC product candidates on unfavorable terms to us.. We may seek additional capital through a variety of means, including through private and public equity offerings and debt financings. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our common stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of such equity or convertible debt securities may include liquidation or other preferences that are senior to or otherwise adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take certain actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, declaring dividends or encumbering our assets to secure future indebtedness, each of which could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business and execute our operating plan. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, including our ADC platforms, or ADC product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts for XMT - 1522, XMT - 1536 or any other ADC product candidate, or grant rights to third parties to develop and market ADC product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.. We may expend our resources to pursue a particular product candidate and fail to capitalize on product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.. Because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on specific product candidates. As a result, we may forgo or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Failure to properly assess potential product candidates could result in our focus on product candidates with low market potential, which would harm our business and financial condition. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable product candidates. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through partnering, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.. 40. Table of Contents. Risks related to development and approval of our ADC product candidates. Failure of a discovery program or product candidate may occur at any stage of preclinical or clinical development, and, because our and our partner's discovery programs and our product candidates are in an early stage of preclinical or clinical development, there is a relatively higher risk of failure and we or our partners may never succeed in generating revenue from such discovery programs or product candidates.. Our early encouraging preclinical results for XMT - 1522 and XMT - 1536 are not necessarily predictive of the results of our ongoing or future discovery programs or clinical studies. Promising results in preclinical studies of a drug candidate may not be predictive of similar results in later - stage preclinical studies or in humans during clinical studies. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late - stage clinical studies after achieving positive results in early - stage development, including early - stage clinical studies, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. These companies' setbacks have been caused by, among other things, preclinical findings made while clinical studies were underway or safety or efficacy observations made in preclinical studies and clinical studies, including previously unreported adverse events.. Any clinical studies that we may conduct may not demonstrate the efficacy and safety necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates. If the results of our ongoing or future clinical studies are inconclusive with respect to the efficacy of our ADC product candidates or if we do not meet the clinical endpoints with statistical significance or if there are safety concerns or adverse events associated with our ADC product candidates, we may be prevented or delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our ADC product candidates. There can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical studies of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in study procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, changes in and adherence to the clinical study protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical study participants. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical studies nonetheless failed to obtain FDA approval.. Alternatively, even if we obtain regulatory approval, that approval may be for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired or may require labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings. We may also be required to perform additional or unanticipated clinical studies to obtain approval or be subject to additional post - marketing testing requirements to maintain regulatory approval. In addition, regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of a product or impose restrictions on its distribution, such as in the form of a modified REMS. The failure to obtain timely regulatory approval of product candidates, any product marketing limitations or a product withdrawal would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.. We currently have only two ADC product candidates, XMT - 1522 and XMT-1536, in clinical studies. A failure of these product candidates in clinical development would adversely affect our business and may require us to discontinue development of other ADC product candidates based on the same technology.. XMT - 1522 and XMT-1536 are our only clinical - stage development product candidates. While we have certain other preclinical programs in development and we intend to develop other product candidates, it will take additional investment and time for such programs to reach the same stage of development as XMT - 1522 and XMT-1536. In addition, we have other product candidates in our current pipeline that are based on the same ADC platform. If XMT - 1522 or XMT-1536 fails in development as a result of any underlying problem with our ADC platform, then we may be required to discontinue development of the ADC product candidates that are based on the same technology. If we were required to discontinue development of XMT - 1522 or XMT-1536 or if XMT - 1522 or XMT-1536 were to fail to receive regulatory approval or were to fail to achieve sufficient market acceptance, we could be prevented from or significantly delayed in achieving profitability.. 41. Table of Contents. Delays in the commencement, enrollment or completion of clinical studies of our ADC product candidates could result in increased costs to us as well as a delay or failure in obtaining regulatory approval, or prevent us from commercializing our ADC product candidates on a timely basis, or at all.. We cannot guarantee that clinical studies, including our ongoing Phase 1 clinical studies and anticipated additional clinical studies for XMT - 1522 and XMT-1536, will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or more clinical studies can occur at any stage of testing. Events that may prevent successful or timely commencement, enrollment or completion of clinical development include, among others:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelays by us in reaching a consensus with regulatory agencies on study design;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelays in reaching, or failing to reach, agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations, or CROs, and clinical study sites;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties in obtaining required IRB approval at each clinical study site;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchallenges in recruiting and enrolling suitable patients to participate in clinical studies that meet the criteria of the protocol for the clinical study;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timposition of a clinical hold by regulatory agencies or IRBs for any reason, including safety concerns or after an inspection of clinical operations or study sites;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure by CROs, other third parties or us to adhere to clinical study requirements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure to perform in accordance with the FDA's good clinical practices, or GCP, or applicable regulatory guidelines in other countries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinadequate quantity or quality of a product candidate or other materials necessary to conduct clinical studies, including, for example, delays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of the ADC product candidates to the clinical sites;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpatients not completing participation in a study or not returning for post - treatment follow - up;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tclinical study sites or patients dropping out of a study;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsafety issues, including occurrence of serious adverse events, or SAEs, in clinical studies that are associated with the ADC product candidates that are viewed to outweigh their potential benefits or unforeseen safety issues in our ongoing preclinical studies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlack of adequate funding to continue the clinical study.. Delays, including delays caused by the above factors, can be costly and could negatively affect our ability to complete a clinical study. If we or our partners are not able to successfully complete clinical studies, we or they will not be able to obtain regulatory approval and will not be able to commercialize our ADC product candidates or our partners' ADC product candidates based on our technology.. 42. Table of Contents. An inability to enroll sufficient numbers of patients in our clinical studies could result in increased costs and longer development periods for our product candidates.. Clinical studies require sufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe size and nature of the patient population;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe severity of the disease under investigation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe nature and complexity of the study protocol, including eligibility criteria for the study;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe number of clinical study sites and the proximity of patients to those sites;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstandard of care in the diseases under investigation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe commitment of clinical investigators to identify eligible patients;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompeting studies or trials; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tclinicians' and patients' perceptions as to the potential advantages and risks of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating.. Challenges in recruiting and enrolling suitable patients to participate in clinical studies that meet the criteria of the protocol for clinical studies could increase costs and result in delays to our current development plan for XMT - 1522, XMT - 1536 or any other future ADC product candidate.. We may seek a Breakthrough Therapy Designation or Fast Track Designation by the FDA for any of our product candidates, and we may be unsuccessful. If we are successful, the designation may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that any product candidate would receive marketing approval.. We may seek a Breakthrough Therapy Designation or Fast Track Designation for any of our product candidates. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Fast Track Designation may be available if a product is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need for this condition. Drugs that receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation or Fast Track Designation by the FDA are eligible for accelerated approval and priority review.. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant Breakthrough Therapy Designation or Fast Track Designation. Even if we receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation or Fast Track Designation for a product candidate, such designation may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if any of our product candidates receives Breakthrough Therapy Designation or Fast Track Designation, the FDA may later decide that the drugs no longer meet the conditions for qualification and rescind the designation.. 43. Table of Contents. Clinical development, regulatory review and approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable. If we or our partners are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.. The preclinical studies and clinical studies of our product candidates are, and the manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates will be, subject to extensive and rigorous review and regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and in other countries where we intend to test and, if approved, market any such product candidate. These government regulations relate to, among other things, development, clinical studies, manufacturing and commercialization. In order to obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any ADC product candidates, we or our partners must demonstrate through extensive preclinical studies and clinical studies that the ADC product candidate is safe and effective for use in each target indication.. The time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable, typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical studies and depends upon numerous factors. Of the large number of drugs in development in the United States, only a small percentage will successfully complete the FDA regulatory approval process and will be commercialized. Accordingly, even if we are able to obtain the requisite financing to continue to fund our development and preclinical studies and clinical studies, we cannot be assured that any of our product candidates will be successfully developed or commercialized.. In addition, approval policies, regulations or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate's clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions, which may cause delays in the approval of or the decision not to approve an application. Regulatory approval has not been obtained for any product candidate based on our ADC technology, and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval. In addition, we may gain regulatory approval for XMT - 1522, XMT - 1536 or any other ADC product candidate in some but not all of the territories for which we seek approval or some but not all of the target indications, resulting in limited commercial opportunity for the approved ADC product candidates.. Applications for our or our partners' product candidates could be delayed or could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including, but not limited to the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the number, design or implementation of our clinical studies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe population studied in the clinical program may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assure safety in the full population for which we seek approval;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical studies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe data collected from clinical studies of our product candidates may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for marketing approval or may otherwise not be sufficient to support the submission of a new drug application or biologics license application, or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA may not accept data generated at our preclinical studies and clinical study sites;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA may require us to conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical studies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be unable to demonstrate to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate's risk - benefit ratio for its proposed indication is acceptable;. 44. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes, test procedures and specifications or facilities of third - party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe or any third - party service providers may be unable to demonstrate compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, which could result in delays in regulatory approval or require us to withdraw or recall products and interrupt commercial supply of our products; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.. Any of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval in jurisdictions outside the United States, we will not be able to market our products in those jurisdictions.. We intend to market our ADC product candidates, including XMT - 1522 and XMT - 1536, if approved, in international markets either directly or through partnerships. We have entered into an agreement with Takeda to commercialize XMT - 1522 outside of the United States and Canada. Such marketing will require separate regulatory approvals in each market and compliance with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedures vary from country to country and may require additional testing that we are not required to perform to obtain regulatory approval in the United States. Moreover, the time required to obtain approval in countries outside the United States may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, an ADC drug must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We or our partners may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We or our partners may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. If we or any existing or future partner are unable to obtain regulatory approval for XMT - 1522 or XMT - 1536 in one or more significant foreign jurisdictions, then the commercial opportunity for XMT - 1522 or XMT - 1536, as applicable, and our financial condition, will be adversely affected.. Even if we receive regulatory approval for our ADC product candidates, such products will be subject to ongoing regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our ADC product candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our products.. Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our ADC product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post - marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety and efficacy. In addition, if the FDA or any other governing regulatory body approves any of our ADC product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post - marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMP and GCP, for any clinical studies that we conduct post - approval.. 45. Table of Contents. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with an approved ADC drug, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing operations or processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfines, warning letters or holds on clinical studies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trefusal by the FDA or any other governing regulatory body to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.. The policies of the FDA or any other governing regulatory body may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our ADC product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.. Our ADC product candidates or ADCs developed or commercialized by our competitors may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that delay or prevent regulatory approval of our ADC product candidates or limit their commercial potential.. Undesirable side effects caused by our ADC product candidates or ADCs being developed or commercialized by our competitors could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies and could result in a more restrictive label or the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities and potential product liability claims. Further, clinical studies by their nature utilize a sample of the potential patient population. With a limited number of subjects and limited duration of exposure, rare and severe side effects of our product candidates or those of our competitors may only be uncovered with a significantly larger number of patients exposed to the drug. SAEs deemed to be caused by our ADC product candidates or those of our competitors, either before or after receipt of marketing approval, could have a material adverse effect on the development of our ADC product candidates and our business as a whole.. If we or others identify undesirable side effects caused by our ADC product candidates or those of our competitors either before or after receipt of marketing approval, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour clinical studies may be put on hold;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our ADC product candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory authorities may withdraw or limit their approvals of our ADC product candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a contraindication, black box warnings or additional warnings;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA may require development of a REMS with Elements to Assure Safe Use as a condition of approval or post - approval;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may decide to remove such product candidates from the marketplace;. 46. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be subject to regulatory investigations and government enforcement actions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour reputation may suffer.. Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our ADC product candidates and could substantially increase commercialization costs.. If we or our third - party collaborators are unable to successfully develop and commercialize any required companion diagnostics for our product candidates or engage a third party to do so, or we or they experience significant delays in doing so, we may not realize the full potential of our product candidates.. If a companion diagnostic is required for the label for XMT - 1536 or any of our future product candidates, therefore conditioning our ability to market such product candidates on the commercial availability of an approved companion diagnostic, we may seek approval for our validated assay as a companion diagnostic or we may contract with third parties to create and obtain approval for a companion diagnostic. To be successful in developing and commercializing such a companion diagnostic, we need to address a number of scientific, technical and logistical challenges. We have little experience in the development and commercialization of diagnostics and may not be successful in developing and commercializing appropriate diagnostics to pair with XMT - 1536 or any of our other product candidates. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory authorities as medical devices and require separate regulatory approval prior to commercialization. Given our limited experience in developing and commercializing diagnostics, we may rely in part or in whole on third parties for their design, manufacture and commercialization. We, our collaborators or such third parties may encounter difficulties in developing and obtaining approval for the companion diagnostics, including issues relating to selectivity/specificity, analytical validation, reproducibility or clinical validation. Any delay or failure by us, our collaborators or such third parties to develop or obtain regulatory approval of the companion diagnostics could delay or prevent approval of our product candidates. If we, or any third parties that we may contract with to assist us, are unable to successfully develop and commercialize companion diagnostics for our product candidates, or experience delays in doing so:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe development of XMT - 1536 and our product candidates, may be adversely affected if we are unable to appropriately select patients for enrollment in our clinical trials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour product candidates may not receive marketing approval if safe and effective use of a therapeutic product candidate depends on the availability of an in vitro diagnostic; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may not realize the full commercial potential of any product candidates that receive marketing approval if, among other reasons, we are unable to appropriately select patients who are likely to benefit from therapy with our products.. As a result, our business would be harmed, possibly materially.. In addition, third - party collaborators may encounter production difficulties that could constrain the supply of the companion diagnostics, and both they and we may have difficulties gaining acceptance of the use of the companion diagnostics in the clinical community. If such companion diagnostics fail to gain market acceptance, it would have an adverse effect on our ability to derive revenues from sales of our product candidates, if approved. In addition, any diagnostic company with whom we contract may decide to discontinue selling or manufacturing the companion diagnostic that we anticipate using in connection with development and commercialization of our product candidates or our relationship with such diagnostic company may otherwise terminate. We may not be able to enter into arrangements with another diagnostic company to obtain supplies of an alternative diagnostic test for use in connection with the development and commercialization of our product candidates or do so on commercially reasonable terms, which could adversely affect and/or delay the development or commercialization of our product candidates.. 47. Table of Contents. We or our partners may fail to discover and develop additional potential product candidates.. Our and our partners' research programs to identify new product candidates will require substantial technical, financial and human resources, and we or our partners may be unsuccessful in our or their efforts to identify new product candidates. If we or our partners are unable to identify suitable additional product candidates for preclinical and clinical development, our or their ability to develop product candidates and our ability to obtain revenues from commercializing our products or to receive royalties from our partners' sales of their products in future periods could be compromised, which could result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely impact our stock price.. Risks related to our reliance on third parties. Because we rely on third - party manufacturing and supply partners, our supply of research and development, preclinical and clinical development materials may become limited or interrupted or may not be of satisfactory quantity or quality.. We rely on third - party contract manufacturers to manufacture our preclinical and clinical study product supplies, and we lack the internal resources and the capability to manufacture any product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. The facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient and final drug product must be acceptable to the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory agencies pursuant to inspections that would be conducted after we submit our marketing application or relevant foreign regulatory submission to the applicable regulatory agency. There can be no assurance that our preclinical and clinical development product supplies will be sufficient, uninterrupted or of satisfactory quality or continue to be available at acceptable prices. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agencies, they will not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. Any replacement of our manufacturers could require significant effort and expertise because there may be a limited number of qualified replacements.. The manufacturing process for an ADC product candidate is subject to FDA and foreign regulatory authority review. Suppliers and manufacturers must meet applicable manufacturing requirements and undergo rigorous facility and process validation tests required by regulatory authorities in order to comply with regulatory standards, such as cGMP. We have no direct control over our contract manufacturers' ability to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. In the event that any of our manufacturers fails to comply with regulatory requirements or to perform its obligations to us in relation to quality, timing or otherwise, or if our supply of components or other materials becomes limited or interrupted for other reasons, we may be forced to manufacture the materials ourselves, for which we currently do not have the capabilities or resources, or enter into an agreement with another third party, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms, if at all. In some cases, the technical skills or technology required to manufacture our ADC product candidates may be unique or proprietary to the original manufacturer and we may have difficulty transferring such skills or technology to another third party and a feasible alternative may not exist. These factors would increase our reliance on such manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from such manufacturer in order to have another third-party manufacture our ADC product candidates. If we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to develop ADC product candidates in a timely manner or within budget. Our reliance on contract manufacturers also exposes us to the possibility that they, or third parties with access to their facilities, will have access to and may appropriate our trade secrets or other proprietary information.. We expect to continue to rely on third - party manufacturers if we receive regulatory approval for any ADC product candidate. To the extent that we have existing, or enter into future, manufacturing arrangements with third parties, we will depend on these third parties to perform their obligations in a timely manner consistent with contractual and regulatory requirements, including those related to quality control and assurance. If we are unable to obtain or maintain third - party manufacturing for ADC product candidates, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to develop and commercialize our ADC product candidates successfully. Our or a third party's failure to execute on our manufacturing requirements and comply with cGMP could adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tan inability to initiate or continue clinical studies of ADC product candidates under development;. 48. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelay in submitting regulatory applications, or receiving regulatory approvals, for ADC product candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of the cooperation of an existing or future strategic partner;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsubjecting third - party manufacturing facilities or our manufacturing facilities to additional inspections by regulatory authorities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta requirement to cease distribution or to recall batches of our ADC product candidates; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tin the event of approval to market and commercialize an ADC product candidate, an inability to meet commercial demands for our products.. We, or our third - party manufacturers, may be unable to successfully scale - up manufacturing of our ADC product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity, which would delay or prevent us from developing our ADC product candidates and commercializing approved products, if any.. In order to conduct clinical studies of our ADC product candidates and commercialize any approved ADC product candidates, we, or our manufacturing partners, will need to manufacture them in large quantities. We, or our manufacturing partners, may be unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for any of our product candidates in a timely or cost - effective manner, or at all. In addition, quality issues may arise during scale - up activities. If we, or any manufacturing partners, are unable to successfully scale up the manufacture of our ADC product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity, the development, testing and clinical studies of that ADC product candidates may be delayed or infeasible, and regulatory approval or commercial launch of any resulting product may be delayed or not obtained, which could significantly harm our business. We have evaluated which third - party manufactures to engage for scale - up to commercial supply of our ADC product candidates, including XMT - 1522 and XMT - 1536 and we have begun transfer and scale-up of certain manufacturing activities. If we are unable to obtain or maintain third - party manufacturing for commercial supply of ADC product candidates, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to develop and commercialize our ADC product candidates successfully.. We rely on third parties to conduct preclinical studies and clinical studies for our ADC product candidates, including XMT - 1522 and XMT - 1536, and if they do not properly and successfully perform their obligations to us, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals for XMT - 1522 or XMT - 1536 or any other ADC product candidates that we may develop in the future.. We have designed the Phase 1 clinical studies for XMT - 1522 and XMT-1536 and intend to design any future clinical study for any future unpartnered ADC product candidates that we may develop if preclinical studies are successful. However, we rely on CROs and other third parties to assist in managing, monitoring and otherwise carrying out many of these studies. As a result, we have less direct control over the conduct, timing and completion of these clinical studies and the management of data developed through clinical studies than would be the case if we were relying entirely upon our own staff. These CROs and other third parties are not our employees and we have limited control over the amount of time and resources that they dedicate to our programs. We compete with many other companies for the resources of these third parties. These third parties may have contractual relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors, which may draw time and resources from our programs. The third parties with whom we contract might not be diligent, careful or timely in conducting our preclinical studies or clinical studies, resulting in the preclinical studies or clinical studies being delayed or unsuccessful.. The third parties on whom we rely generally may terminate their engagements at any time, and having to enter into alternative arrangements would delay development and commercialization of our ADC product candidates. Communicating with outside parties can also be challenging, potentially leading to mistakes as well as difficulties in coordinating activities. Outside parties may:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thave staffing difficulties;. 49. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfail to comply with contractual obligations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texperience regulatory compliance issues;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tundergo changes in priorities or become financially distressed; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tform relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors.. The FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities require compliance with regulations and standards, including GCP, for designing, conducting, monitoring, recording, analyzing and reporting the results of clinical studies to assure that the data and results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of study participants are protected. Although we rely, and intend to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct our clinical studies, they are not our employees, and we are responsible for ensuring that each of these clinical studies is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan, protocol and other requirements. Our reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities.. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their duties under their agreements, if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to clinical study protocols or to regulatory requirements, or if they otherwise fail to comply with clinical study protocols or meet expected deadlines, the clinical studies of our ADC product candidates may not meet regulatory requirements. The FDA enforces GCP regulations through periodic inspections of clinical study sponsors, principal investigators and study sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs or other regulatory requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical studies may be deemed unreliable, third parties may need to be replaced and preclinical development activities or clinical studies may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated. If any of these events occur, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our ADC product candidates on a timely basis or at all.. We depend on strategic partnerships with other companies to assist in the research, development and commercialization of our ADC platforms and ADC product candidates. If our existing partners do not perform as expected, this may negatively affect our ability to commercialize our ADC product candidates, including XMT - 1522, or generate revenues through technology licensing, or may otherwise negatively affect our business.. We have established strategic partnerships and intend to continue to establish strategic partnerships with third parties to research, develop and commercialize our ADC platforms and existing and future ADC product candidates. We entered into a collaboration agreement with Takeda in January 2016 for the co - development of XMT - 1522 that granted Takeda rights to commercialize XMT - 1522 outside of the United States and Canada. We also have entered into another collaboration agreement with Takeda and a collaboration agreement with Merck KGaA for the development and commercialization of other ADC product candidates. For certain of these programs, we will depend on our partners to design and conduct their clinical studies. As a result, we may not be able to conduct these programs in the manner or on the time schedule we currently contemplate, which may negatively impact our business operations. In addition, if any of these partners withdraw support for these programs or proposed products or otherwise impair their development, our business could be negatively affected.. Our partners may terminate their agreements with us for cause under certain circumstances or at will in certain cases and discontinue use of our technologies. In addition, we cannot control the amount and timing of resources our partners may devote to products utilizing or incorporating our technology. Moreover, our relationships with our partners may divert significant time and effort of our scientific staff and management team and require effective allocation of our resources to multiple internal and collaborative projects. Our partners may fail to perform their obligations under the collaboration agreements or may not perform their obligations in a timely manner. If conflicts arise between our partners and us, the other party may act in a manner adverse to us and could limit our ability to implement our strategies. If any of our partners terminate or breach our agreements with them, or otherwise fail to complete their obligations in a timely manner, it may have a detrimental effect on our financial position by reducing or eliminating the potential for us to receive technology access and license fees, milestones and royalties, reimbursement of development costs, as well as possibly requiring us to devote additional efforts and incur costs associated with pursuing internal development of product candidates. Furthermore, if our partners do not prioritize and commit sufficient resources to programs associated with our product. 50. Table of Contents. candidates or collaboration product candidates, we or our partners may be unable to commercialize these product candidates, which would limit our ability to generate revenue and become profitable.. In particular, if Takeda were to terminate the XMT - 1522 strategic partnership, we would not receive milestone payments, co - funded development payments or, following approval, royalties for the sale of XMT - 1522 outside the United States and Canada. As a result of such termination, we would have to engage another strategic partner to complete the XMT - 1522 development process and to commercialize XMT - 1522 outside the United States and Canada, or to complete the development process and undertake commercializing XMT - 1522 outside the United States and Canada ourselves, either of which could significantly delay the continued development and commercialization of XMT - 1522 and would increase our costs. In turn, this could significantly harm our financial position, adversely affect our stock price and require us to incur all the costs of developing and commercializing XMT - 1522, which are now being co - funded by Takeda.. Our partners may separately pursue competing products, therapeutic approaches or technologies to develop treatments for the diseases targeted by us or our partners. Competing products, either developed by the partners or to which the partners have rights, may result in the withdrawal of partner support for our product candidates. Even if our partners continue their contributions to the strategic partnerships, they may nevertheless determine not to actively pursue the development or commercialization of any resulting products. Any of these developments could harm our product development efforts.. To date, we have depended on a small number of partners for a substantial portion of our revenue. The loss of any one of these partners could result in a material decline in our revenue.. We have strategic partnerships with a limited number of companies. To date, a substantial portion of our revenue has resulted from payments made under agreements with our strategic partners, and we expect that a portion of our revenue will continue to come from strategic partnerships. If XMT - 1522 receives regulatory approval, our revenues will still depend in part on Takeda's ability and willingness to market the approved product outside of the United States and Canada. The loss of any of our partners, especially Takeda, or the failure of our partners to perform their obligations under their agreements with us, including paying license or technology fees, milestone payments, royalties or reimbursements, could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Payments under our existing and future strategic partnerships are also subject to significant fluctuations in both timing and amount, which could cause our revenue to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors and cause a decrease in our stock price.. We may not be successful in establishing and maintaining additional strategic partnerships, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products, negatively impacting our operating results.. We continue to strategically evaluate our partnerships and, as appropriate, we expect to enter into additional strategic partnerships in the future, including potentially with major biotechnology or biopharmaceutical companies. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate partners for our ADC product candidates, and the negotiation process is time - consuming and complex. In order for us to successfully partner our ADC product candidates, potential partners must view these ADC product candidates as economically valuable in markets they determine to be attractive in light of the terms that we are seeking and other available products for licensing by other companies. Even if we are successful in our efforts to establish strategic partnerships, the terms that we agree upon may not be favorable to us, and we may not be able to maintain such strategic partnerships if, for example, development or approval of an ADC product candidate is delayed or sales of an approved product are disappointing. Any delay in entering into strategic partnership agreements related to our ADC product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of such candidates and reduce their competitiveness even if they reach the market. If we are not able to generate revenue under our strategic partnerships when and in accordance with our expectations or the expectations of industry analysts, this failure could harm our business and have an immediate adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.. If we fail to establish and maintain additional strategic partnerships related to our unpartnered ADC product candidates, we will bear all of the risk and costs related to the development of any such ADC product candidate, and we may need to seek additional financing, hire additional employees and otherwise develop expertise, such as regulatory expertise, for which we have not budgeted. If we were not successful in seeking additional financing, hiring additional employees or developing additional expertise, our cash burn rate would increase or we would need to take steps to reduce our rate of. 51. Table of Contents. ADC product candidate development. This could negatively affect the development of any unpartnered ADC product candidate.. Risks related to commercialization of our ADC product candidates. Our future commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of our ADC product candidates, if approved, among physicians, patients and health care payors.. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for XMT - 1522, XMT - 1536 or any other ADC product candidates that we may develop or acquire in the future, the product candidate may not gain market acceptance among physicians, health care payors, patients and the medical community. Market acceptance of any approved products depends on a number of factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe efficacy and safety of the product, as demonstrated in clinical studies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe indications for which the product is approved and the label approved by regulatory authorities for use with the product, including any warnings that may be required on the label;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacceptance by physicians and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost, safety and efficacy of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third - party payors and government authorities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trelative convenience and ease of administration;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe prevalence and severity of adverse side effects; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.. Perceptions of any product are influenced by perceptions of competitors' products that are in the same class of drugs or have a similar mechanism of action. As a result, adverse public perception of our competitors' ADC products may negatively impact the market acceptance of our ADC product candidates. Market acceptance is critical to our ability to generate significant revenue and become profitable. Any therapeutic candidate, if approved and commercialized, may be accepted in only limited capacities or not at all. If any approved products are not accepted by the market to the extent that we expect, we may not be able to generate significant revenue and our business would suffer.. The incidence and prevalence for target patient populations of our drug candidates have not been established with precision. If the market opportunities for our drug candidates are smaller than we estimate or if any approval that we obtain is based on a narrower definition of the patient population, our revenue and ability to achieve profitability will be adversely affected, possibly materially.. The precise incidence and prevalence of breast cancer, NSCLC and gastric cancer with low HER2 expression and of epithelial ovarian cancer and non - squamous NSCLC with NaPi2b expression are unknown. Our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our drug candidates, are based on estimates. The total addressable market opportunity for XMT - 1522 for the treatment of patients with breast cancer, NSCLC and gastric cancer with HER2 expression and XMT - 1536 for the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer and non - squamous NSCLC with NaPi2b expression will ultimately depend upon, among other things, the diagnosis criteria included in the final label for each of XMT - 1522 and XMT - 1536, if our drug candidates are approved for sale for these indications, acceptance by the medical community and patient access, drug pricing and reimbursement. The number of patients who can be treated with our drug candidates may turn out to be lower than expected, patients may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our drugs, or new patients. 52. Table of Contents. may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, all of which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business.. If we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates if and when they are approved.. We do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure and have no experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of products. To achieve commercial success for any product for which we have obtained marketing approval, we will need to establish a sales and marketing organization.. In the future, we expect to build a focused sales and marketing infrastructure to market XMT - 1522 in the United States and Canada, if and when it is approved, and to market XMT - 1536 and other ADC product candidates in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, if and when they are approved. There are risks involved with establishing our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe lack of adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.. If we are unable to establish our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and enter into arrangements with third parties to perform these services, our product revenues and our profitability, if any, are likely to be lower than if we were to market, sell and distribute any products that we develop ourselves.. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell, market and distribute certain of our product candidates outside of the United States or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.. Reimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our ADC product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably.. In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third - party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. These third-party payors decide which drugs will be covered and establish reimbursement levels for those drugs. The containment of health care costs has become a priority of foreign and domestic governments as well as private third-party payors. The prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments and private third - party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications, which could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably.. 53. Table of Contents. Cost - control initiatives could cause us to decrease the price we might establish for products, which could result in lower than anticipated product revenues.. Reimbursement by a third - party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third - party payor's determination that use of a product is:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta covered benefit under its health plan;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsafe, effective and medically necessary;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tappropriate for the specific patient;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcost - effective; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tneither experimental nor investigational.. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in XMT - 1522, XMT - 1536 or any future ADC product candidates, even if such product candidates obtain marketing approval.. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third - party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost - effectiveness data for the use of our products to the payor. Further, there is significant uncertainty related to third - party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved drugs. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. We cannot be sure that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be available for any of our ADC product candidates. Also, we cannot be sure that reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to commercialize certain of our products. In addition, in the United States, third - party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third - party payors will reimburse patients for their use of newly approved drugs, which in turn will put pressure on the pricing of drugs.. Price controls may be imposed in foreign markets, which may adversely affect our future profitability.. In some countries, including member states of the European Union, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to governmental control. Additional countries may adopt similar approaches to the pricing of prescription drugs. In such countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after receipt of marketing approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low - priced and high - priced member states, can further reduce prices. In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study or other studies that compare the cost - effectiveness of our ADC product candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. We cannot be sure that such prices and reimbursement will be acceptable to us or our strategic partners. Publication of discounts by third - party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels or if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, our revenues from sales by us or our strategic partners and the potential profitability of our ADC product candidates in those countries would be negatively affected.. 54. Table of Contents. The impact of health care reform legislation and other changes in the health care industry and in health care spending on us is currently unknown and may adversely affect our business model.. Our revenue prospects could be affected by changes in health care spending and policy in the United States and abroad. We operate in a highly regulated industry and new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to health care availability, the method of delivery or payment for health care products and services could negatively impact our business, operations and financial condition.. The United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of health care. In March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Health Care Reform Act, which include changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government health care programs such as:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreasing drug rebates under state Medicaid programs for brand name prescription drugs and extending those rebates to Medicaid managed care;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\textending discounted rates on drug products available under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program to additional hospitals and other providers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tassessing a fee on manufacturers and importers of brand name prescription drugs reimbursed under certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequiring drug manufacturers to provide a 50% discount on Medicare Part D brand name prescription drugs sold to Medicare beneficiaries whose prescription drug costs cause the beneficiaries to be subject to the Medicare Part D coverage gap (i.e., the so - called \"donut hole\").. It is likely that federal and state legislatures within the United States and foreign governments will continue to consider changes to existing health care legislation. We cannot predict the reform initiatives that may be adopted in the future or whether initiatives that have been adopted will be repealed or modified. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care services to contain or reduce costs of health care may adversely affect:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe demand for any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement approval for a product;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of taxes that we are required to pay.. Modifications to or repeal of all or certain provisions of the Health Care Reform Act are expected as a result of the outcome of the 2016 presidential election and Congressional Republicans maintaining control of Congress, consistent with statements made by Donald Trump and members of Congress during the presidential campaign and following the election. Some of the provisions of the Health Care Reform Act have yet to be implemented, and there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Act. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the Health Care Reform Act. Moreover, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted on December 22, 2017 and includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Health Care Reform Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \"individual mandate.\" Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or replace additional elements of the Health Care Reform Act. We continue to evaluate the effect that the Health Care Reform Act, the repeal of the. 55.

In addition to the Health Care Reform Act, there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third party payors to address, among other things, healthcare costs and individual healthcare benefits. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the Healthcare Reform Act, and significant changes to, or repeal of, the Healthcare Reform Act could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and profitability.. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the 2010 health care reform legislation. The Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, or the Budget Control Act, includes provisions intended to reduce the federal deficit. The Budget Control Act resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare payments to providers beginning in 2013. Legislation extends reductions through 2023. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented, or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us, as part of any broader deficit reduction effort or legislative replacement to the Budget Control Act, could have an adverse impact on our anticipated product revenues.. We face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before, or more successfully than, we do.. The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. Many third parties compete with us in developing various approaches to cancer therapy. They include pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions and other research organizations. Any treatments developed by our competitors could be superior to our ADC product candidates. It is possible that these competitors will succeed in developing technologies that are more effective than our ADC platforms or ADC product candidates or that would render our ADC platforms obsolete or noncompetitive. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as additional companies enter our market and scientific developments surrounding other cancer therapies continue to accelerate.. We are also aware of multiple companies with ADC technologies that may be competitive to our ADC platforms, including Astellas, AstraZeneca, Bristol - Myers Squibb, Daiichi Sankyo, ImmunoGen, Immunomedics, Pfizer and Seattle Genetics. These companies or their partners, including AbbVie, Genentech, Lilly, Novartis, Sanofi and Takeda, may develop ADC product candidates which compete in the same indications as our current and future ADC product candidates. There are approximately 75 ADC product candidates in active clinical development. There are currently four approved ADC therapies in the United States: brentuximab vedotin, marketed by Seattle Genetics and Takeda, ado - trastuzumab emtansine, marketed by Genentech, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, marketed by Pfizer; and inotuzumab ozogamicin, also marketed by Pfizer. Ado - trastuzumab emtansine is a HER2 targeted ADC approved for use in HER2-positive patients and, even though we are developing, and expect to get approval for, XMT - 1522 for lower expressing HER2 patients, ado - trastuzumab emtansine may compete with our HER2 targeted ADC, XMT - 1522, if XMT - 1522 is approved. We expect to compete on improved efficacy, safety and tolerability compared to other ADC product candidates and if our products are not demonstrably superior in these respects compared to other approved therapeutics, we may not be able to compete effectively.. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical studies, obtaining regulatory approval and marketing than we do. In addition, many of these competitors are active in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements in anticipation of collecting royalties for use of technology that they have developed. Smaller or early - stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through strategic partnerships with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs.. In addition, if our product candidates are approved and commercialized, we may face competition from biosimilars. The route to market for biosimilars was established with the passage of the Health Care Reform Act in March 2010. The Health Care Reform Act establishes a pathway for the FDA approval of follow - on biologics and provides twelve years data. 56. Table of Contents. exclusivity for reference products and an additional six months exclusivity period if pediatric studies are conducted. In Europe, the European Medicines Agency has issued guidelines for approving products through an abbreviated pathway, and biosimilars have been approved in Europe. If a biosimilar version of one of our potential products were approved in the United States or Europe, it could have a negative effect on sales and gross profits of the potential product and our financial condition.. With respect to our current and potential future product candidates, we believe that our ability to compete effectively and develop products that can be manufactured cost - effectively and marketed successfully will depend on our ability to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadvance our technology platforms;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our technologies and products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtain required government and other public and private approvals on a timely basis;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tattract and retain key personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcommercialize effectively;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtain reimbursement for our products in approved indications;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcomply with applicable laws, regulations and regulatory requirements and restrictions with respect to the commercialization of our products, including with respect to any changed or increased regulatory restrictions; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into additional strategic partnerships to advance the development and commercialization of our product candidates.. Risks related to our intellectual property. If we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to our technology and ADC product candidates, or if our intellectual property rights are inadequate, we may not be able to compete effectively.. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection with respect to our intellectual property and proprietary technology. We rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our ADC platforms and ADC product candidates, XMT - 1522 and XMT - 1536. The patent position of biopharmaceutical companies is generally uncertain because it involves complex legal and factual considerations and has, in recent years, been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights is highly uncertain. The standards applied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and foreign patent offices in granting patents are not always applied uniformly or predictably. For example, there is no uniform worldwide policy regarding patentable subject matter or the scope of claims allowable in patents. In addition, changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The patent prosecution process is expensive, complex and time - consuming, and we may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain, enforce or license all necessary or desirable patents and patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. There is no assurance that all potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found. We may be unaware of prior art that could be used to invalidate an issued patent or prevent our pending patent applications from issuing as patents.. The patent applications that we own or in - license may fail to result in issued patents, and even if they do issue as patents, such patents may not cover our ADC platforms and ADC product candidates in the United States or in other countries. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be. 57. Table of Contents. challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and product candidates. For example, even if patent applications we license or own do successfully issue as patents and even if such patents cover our ADC platforms and ADC product candidates, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed or invalidated. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not provide adequate protection or exclusivity for our ADC platform or ADC product candidates, prevent others from designing around our claims or otherwise provide us with a competitive advantage. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business.. If patent applications we own or have in - licensed with respect to our ADC platforms or our ADC product candidates fail to issue as patents, if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, or if they fail to provide meaningful exclusivity, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us. We cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue, the breadth of any such patents or whether any issued patents will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. Any successful challenge to these patents or any other patents owned by or licensed to us could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful development and commercialization of any ADC product candidate. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to an ADC product candidate. Furthermore, if third parties have filed such patent applications, an interference proceeding in the United States can be initiated by the USPTO or a third - party to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. In addition, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent and the protection it affords is limited. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, our owned or in - licensed patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. If we encounter delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market an ADC drug under patent protection could be further reduced. Even if patents covering our ADC product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition from similar or generic products. The launch of a generic version of one of our products in particular would be likely to result in an immediate and substantial reduction in the demand for our product, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy - Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy - Smith Act, was signed into law, which could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. The Leahy - Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art, may affect patent litigation and switch the U.S. patent system from a \"first - to - invent\" system to a \"first - to - file\" system. Under a first - to - file system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier. These provisions also allow third - party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and set forth additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by the USPTO administered post grant proceedings. The USPTO developed additional regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy - Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy - Smith Act, and, in particular, the first - to - file provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy - Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. The Leahy - Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.. Any loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. We may be unable to prevent competitors from entering the market with a product that is similar to or the same as our ADC product candidates.. 58. Table of Contents. Issued patents covering XMT - 1522 and XMT - 1536 and any future ADC product candidates could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or before the USPTO or comparable foreign authority.. If we or one of our licensing partners initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of XMT - 1522, XMT - 1536 or any other future product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace, and there are numerous grounds upon which a third party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent. Grounds for a validity challenge could be, among other things, an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, lack of written description or non - enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be, among other things, an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re - examination, inter partes review, post - grant review, interference proceedings, derivation proceedings and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in revocation, cancellation or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover and protect our product candidates. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity of our patents, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we, our licensors, our patent counsel and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a third party were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on one or more of our product candidates. Any such loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.. If we fail to comply with our obligations under any license, strategic partnership or other agreements, we may be required to pay damages and could lose intellectual property rights that are necessary for developing and protecting our product candidates.. We rely, in part, on license, collaboration and other agreements. We may need to obtain additional licenses from others to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates and it is possible that we may be unable to obtain additional licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. The licensing or acquisition of third party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and several more established companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, capital resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to use. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment.. In addition, our existing licenses and collaboration agreements, including our license with Recepta Biopharma S.A., or Recepta, for intellectual property covering the NaPi2b antibody in XMT - 1536 and our agreement with Adimab under which we acquired Adimab's rights to XMT - 1519, the antibody in XMT - 1522, and were granted a license to certain intellectual property controlled by Adimab to exploit ADC product candidates containing XMT - 1519, including XMT - 1522, impose, and any future licenses, collaborations or other agreements we enter into are likely to impose, various development, commercialization, funding, milestone, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution and enforcement or other obligations on us. If we breach any of these obligations, or use the intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, we may be required to pay damages and the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, including, in the case of our agreement with Recepta, the license for the rights covering the NaPi2b antibody in XMT - 1536. In addition, if we breach certain obligations under our agreement with Adimab, Adimab may have the right to reacquire the rights to XMT - 1519. Any of the foregoing could result in us being unable to develop, manufacture and sell products that are covered by the licensed technology or enable a competitor to gain access to the licensed technology. Disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing, collaboration or other agreements, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation related issues;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;. 59. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inventorship and ownership of inventions and know how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe priority of invention of patented technology.. In addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology to or from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates.. In some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering the technology that we license from third parties. For example, pursuant to our license agreement with Recepta, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research Ltd., a co - owner of the intellectual property, retains control of such activities. Therefore, we cannot be certain that these patents and applications will be prosecuted, maintained and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If our licensors fail to obtain or maintain such intellectual property, or lose rights to such intellectual property, the rights we have licensed and our exclusivity may be reduced or eliminated and our right to develop and commercialize any of our products that are subject to such licensed rights could be adversely affected.. Moreover, our rights to our in - licensed patents and patent applications are dependent, in part, on inter - institutional or other operating agreements between the joint owners of such in - licensed patents and patent applications. If one or more of such joint owners breaches such inter - institutional or operating agreements, our rights to such in - licensed patents and patent applications may be adversely affected. In addition, while we cannot currently determine the amount of the royalty obligations we would be required to pay on sales of future products, if any, the amounts may be significant. The amount of our future royalty obligations will depend on the technology and intellectual property we use in products that we successfully develop and commercialize, if any. Therefore, even if we successfully develop and commercialize products, we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights or maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of the relevant program or product candidate and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could suffer.. We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property or to defend against intellectual property claims, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.. Competitors and other third parties may infringe our patents or misappropriate or otherwise violate our owned and in - licensed intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, litigation or other intellectual property proceedings may be necessary to enforce or defend our owned and in - licensed intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of our own intellectual property rights or the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation or proceedings can be expensive and time consuming, and any such claims could provoke defendants to assert counterclaims against us, including claims alleging that we infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to litigate intellectual property rights than we can and have more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our. 60. Table of Contents. intellectual property. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other intellectual property proceedings could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could harm our business and financial results.. In addition, in a litigation or other proceeding, a court or administrative judge may decide that a patent owned by or licensed to us is invalid or unenforceable, or a court may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or other proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation and other proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. During the course of any patent or other intellectual property litigation or other proceeding, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, rulings on motions and other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the perceived value of our ADC product candidates, programs or intellectual property could be diminished. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock may decline. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.. Third - party claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.. Our commercial success depends in part on our ability and the ability of our strategic partners to develop, manufacture, market and sell product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biopharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions, reexamination, inter partes review, derivation and post grant review proceedings before the USPTO and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing and may develop our ADC product candidates. As the biopharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our ADC product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.. Third parties may assert that we, our customers, licensees or parties indemnified by us are employing their proprietary technology without authorization or have infringed upon, misappropriated or otherwise violated their intellectual property or other rights, regardless of their merit. For example, we may be subject to claims that we are infringing the patent, trademark or copyright rights of third parties, or that our employees have misappropriated or divulged their former employers' trade secrets or confidential information. There may be third - party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our ADC product candidates, that we failed to identify. For example, applications filed before November 29, 2000 and certain applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until issued as patents. Except for certain exceptions, including the preceding exceptions, patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are generally published only after a waiting period of approximately 18 months after the earliest filing, and sometimes not at all. Therefore, patent applications covering our ADC platforms or our ADC product candidates could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending patent applications which have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our ADC platforms, our ADC product candidates or the use or manufacture of our ADC product candidates.. Even if we believe a third party's claims against us are without merit, a court of competent jurisdiction could hold that such third party's patent is valid, enforceable and cover aspects of our product candidates, including the materials, formulations, methods of manufacture, methods of analysis, or methods for treatment, in which case, such third party would be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable technology or product candidate until such patent expired or unless we obtain a license and we may be required to pay such third-party monetary damages, which could be substantial. Such licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property and it could require us to make substantial licensing and royalty payments. Ultimately, we could be prevented. 61. Table of Contents. from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms.. Parties making claims against us may also obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize our ADC technology or one or more of our ADC product candidates. Defending against claims of patent infringement, misappropriation of trade secrets or other violations of intellectual property could be costly and time consuming, regardless of the outcome. Thus, even if we were to ultimately prevail, or to settle at an early stage, such litigation could burden us with substantial unanticipated costs. In addition, litigation or threatened litigation could result in significant demands on the time and attention of our management team, distracting them from the pursuit of other company business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, in addition to potential injunctive relief, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys' fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure.. We may face a claim of misappropriation if a third party believes that we inappropriately obtained and used trade secrets of such third party. If we are found to have misappropriated a third party's trade secrets, we may be prevented from further using such trade secrets, limiting our ability to develop our ADC product candidates, we may be required to obtain a license to such trade secrets which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all and may be non - exclusive, and we may be required to pay damages, which could be substantial. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights throughout the world.. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world where we expect there to be significant markets for our products could be prohibitively expensive, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. In addition, our intellectual property license agreements may not always include worldwide rights. For example, certain U.S. and foreign issued patents and patent applications are licensed to us by Recepta on a worldwide basis, except that Recepta retains exclusive rights in such patents and patent applications in Brazil. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection or licenses but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.. Additionally, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our licensed and owned patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing as patents, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.. Many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.. 62. Table of Contents. Confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.. In addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know - how that is not patentable or that we elect not to patent, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our platform technology and discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know - how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and outside scientific advisors, contractors and partners. We cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreement with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or proprietary technology and processes. Additionally, our confidentiality agreements and other contractual protections may not be adequate to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized disclosure, third - party infringement or misappropriation. We may not have adequate remedies in the case of a breach of any such agreements, and our trade secrets and other proprietary information could be disclosed to our competitors or others may independently develop substantially equivalent or superior proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technologies.. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts outside and within the United States sometimes are less willing to protect trade secrets. Misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business.. We may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our licensors, employees, consultants, advisors or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.. Many of our and our licensors' employees, including our senior management, consultants or advisors are currently, or previously were, employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees, including members of our senior management, executed proprietary rights, non - disclosure and non - competition agreements, or similar agreements, in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know - how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these individuals have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such individual's current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel or sustain damages. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or products. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.. In addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self - executing or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.. If we do not obtain patent term extension and data exclusivity for any product candidates we may develop, our business may be materially harmed.. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of any FDA marketing approval of any product candidates we may develop, one or more of our owned or in - licensed U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or Hatch - Waxman Amendments. The Hatch - Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA. 63. Table of Contents. regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. However, we may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents, or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed.. Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by government patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non - compliance with these requirements.. Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other government fees on patents and patent applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various government patent agencies outside of the United States over the lifetime of our owned or licensed patents and applications. In certain circumstances, we rely on our licensing partners to pay these fees due to U.S. and non - U.S. patent agencies. The USPTO and various non - U.S. government agencies require compliance with several procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We are also dependent on our licensors to take the necessary action to comply with these requirements with respect to our licensed intellectual property. In some cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. There are situations, however, in which non - compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in a partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, potential competitors might be able to enter the market with similar or identical products or technology, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.. Intellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats.. The degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tothers may be able to make ADC products that are similar to any product candidates we may develop or utilize similar ADC - related technology but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we license or may own in the future;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe, or our license partners or current or future strategic partners, might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we license or may own in the future;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe, or our license partners or current or future strategic partners, might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our or their inventions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our owned or licensed intellectual property rights;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tit is possible that our pending licensed patent applications or those that we may own in the future will not lead to issued patents;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tissued patents that we hold rights to may be held invalid or unenforceable, including as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;. 64. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe patents of others may harm our business; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may choose not to file a patent in order to maintain certain trade secrets or know how, and a third party may subsequently file a patent covering such intellectual property.. Should any of these events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.. Risks related to our business and industry. If we fail to attract and keep senior management and key scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop our ADC product candidates, conduct our clinical studies and commercialize our ADC product candidates.. Our ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries depends upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. We are highly dependent on members of our senior management, including Anna Protopapas, our President and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of any of these persons could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives. Also, each of these persons may terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \"key person\" insurance for any of our executives or other employees.. Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. We conduct our operations at our facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a region that is headquarters to many other biopharmaceutical companies and many academic and research institutions. Competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high, which may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms or at all. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors, may be employed or have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.. We may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.. As we seek to advance our ADC product candidates through clinical studies and commercialization, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our ADC product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical studies effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management, administrative and, if necessary, sales and marketing personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company or disrupt our operations.. 65. Table of Contents. Our relationships with health care professionals, institutional providers, principal investigators, consultants, customers (actual and potential) and third - party payors are, and will continue to be, subject, directly and indirectly, to federal and state health care fraud and abuse, false claims, marketing expenditure tracking and disclosure, government price reporting and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face penalties, including, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations.. Our business operations and activities may be directly or indirectly subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti - Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act. If we obtain FDA approval for any of our ADC product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the United States, our potential exposure under such laws will increase significantly, and our costs associated with compliance with such laws are also likely to increase. These laws may impact, among other things, our current activities with principal investigators and research subjects, as well as proposed and future sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by the federal government and state governments in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal Anti - Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid or other third - party payors that are false or fraudulent or knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any health care benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, health care benefits, items or services relating to health care matters;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal physician self - referral law, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits a physician from making a referral to an entity for certain designated health services reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid if the physician or a member of the physician's family has a financial relationship with the entity, and which also prohibits the submission of any claims for reimbursement for designated health services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under Section 6002 of the Health Care Reform Act, and its implementing regulations requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain. 66. Table of Contents. exceptions) to report annually to the United States Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, with data collection required beginning August 1, 2013 and reporting to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services required by March 31, 2014 and by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfederal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfederal government price reporting laws, changed by the Health Care Reform Act to, among other things, increase the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and offer such rebates to additional populations, that require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement or discounts on our marketed drugs (participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements may subject us to potentially significant discounts on our products, increased infrastructure costs, and potentially limit our ability to offer certain marketplace discounts);.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a United States law which regulates certain financial relationships with foreign government officials (which could include, for example, certain medical professionals); and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti - kickback, false claims, consumer protection and unfair competition laws which may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements as well as submitting claims involving health care items or services reimbursed by any third - party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require biotech companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts payments that may be made to health care providers; state laws that require drug manufacturers to file reports with states regarding marketing information, such as the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration and items of value provided to health care professionals and entities (compliance with such requirements may require investment in infrastructure to ensure that tracking is performed properly, and some of these laws result in the public disclosure of various types of payments and relationships, which could potentially have a negative effect on our business or increase enforcement scrutiny of our activities); and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, with differing effects.. In addition, the regulatory approval and commercialization of any of our product candidates outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the health care laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.. The Health Care Reform Act, among other things, amended the intent standard of the federal Anti - Kickback Statute and criminal health care fraud statutes to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Health Care Reform Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti - Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act.. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable health care laws may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other health care laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations.. 67. Table of Contents. Our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.. We are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with manufacturing standards we have established, to comply with federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, to report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self - dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical studies, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.. If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our ADC product candidates.. We face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our ADC product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our ADC product candidates. Even a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinjury to our reputation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdecreased demand for our product candidates or products that we may develop;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twithdrawal of clinical study participants;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcosts to defend the related litigations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta diversion of management's time and our resources;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsubstantial monetary awards to study participants or patients;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of revenue;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability to commercialize our ADC product candidates; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta decline in our stock price.. 68. Table of Contents. Failure to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we develop. We currently carry product liability insurance covering our clinical studies in the amount of $10 million in the aggregate. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. In such instance, we might have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts. If we are unable to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, it could prevent or inhibit the development and commercial production and sale of our product candidates, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.. We and our third - party contract manufacturers must comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant costs or liabilities.. We and our third - party manufacturers are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the use, generation, manufacture, distribution, storage, handling, treatment, remediation and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Hazardous chemicals, including flammable and biological materials, are involved in certain aspects of our business, and we cannot eliminate the risk of injury or contamination from the use, generation, manufacture, distribution, storage, handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. In the event of contamination or injury, or failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any such liability could exceed our assets and resources. We could also incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.. Although we maintain workers' compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent. We may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.. Further, with respect to the operations of our third - party contract manufacturers, it is possible that if they fail to operate in compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or properly dispose of wastes associated with our products, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, suffer reputational harm or experience a disruption in the manufacture and supply of our product candidates or products.. We may acquire assets or form strategic alliances in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such acquisitions.. We may acquire additional technologies and assets, form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. If we acquire assets with promising markets or technologies, we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such assets if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing technologies. We may encounter numerous difficulties in developing, manufacturing and marketing any new products resulting from a strategic alliance or acquisition that delay or prevent us from realizing their expected benefits or enhancing our business. We cannot be assured that, following any such acquisition, we will achieve the expected synergies to justify the transaction.. 69. Table of Contents. Our internal computer systems, or those of our strategic partners, third - party CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product candidates' development programs.. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our strategic partners, third - party CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. If a failure, accident or security breach were to occur and cause interruptions in our or our CROs' operations, it could result in a material disruption of our programs. For example, the loss of clinical study data for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or other data or applications relating to our technology or product candidates, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.. Unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. For example, the global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, such as the global financial crisis, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including, weakened demand for our product candidates and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.. Risks related to our common stock. We are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.. We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act, (2) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and (3) exemptions from the requirements of holding a non - binding advisory vote on executive compensation.. We could be an emerging growth company through 2022, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by non - affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of any June 30 before that time or if we have total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, in which cases we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31 or, if we issue more than $1.00 billion in non - convertible debt during any three - year period before that time, we would cease to be an emerging growth company immediately. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a \"smaller reporting company\" which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. When these exemptions cease to apply, we expect to incur additional expenses and devote increased management effort toward ensuring compliance with them, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of such additional costs.. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption. 70. Table of Contents. from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.. If our stock price is volatile, our stockholders could incur substantial losses.. Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile. Since our initial public offering, or IPO, in June 2017, the price of our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Select Global Market has ranged from a low of $12.71 on June 29, 2017 to a high of $21.01 on October 3, 2017. The market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this \"Risk Factors\" section, and others beyond our control, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tresults and timing of preclinical studies and clinical studies of our ADC product candidates, including XMT - 1522 and XMT - 1536;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tresults of clinical studies of our competitors' products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure to adequately protect our trade secrets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe terms on which we raise additional capital or our ability to raise it;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcommencement or termination of any strategic partnership or licensing arrangement;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory developments, including actions with respect to our products or our competitors' products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpublication of research reports by securities analysts about us or our competitors or our industry;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour failure or the failure of our competitors to meet analysts' projections or guidance that we or our competitors may give to the market;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadditions and departures of key personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstrategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin - offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe passage of legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tspeculation in the press or investment community;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncement or expectation of additional financing efforts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in market conditions for biopharmaceutical stocks; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in general market and economic conditions.. In addition, the stock market has historically experienced significant volatility, particularly with respect to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences company stocks. The volatility of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences company stocks often does not relate to the operating performance of the companies represented by the stock. As. 71. Table of Contents. a result of this volatility, stockholders may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price for which they paid for their shares. As we operate in a single industry, we are especially vulnerable to these factors to the extent that they affect our industry or our products, or to a lesser extent our markets. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources, and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation.. Our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and are able to exercise significant influence over matters subject to stockholder approval.. As of December 31, 2017, our executive officers, directors and stockholders who own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, together with their respective affiliates, beneficially owned a substantial majority of our common stock, including shares subject to outstanding options and warrants that are exercisable within 60 days after such date. Accordingly, these stockholders are able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of our board of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of entrenching our management or board of directors, delaying or preventing a change in our control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could have a material and adverse effect on the fair market value of our common stock.. We are incurring and will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance requirements and initiatives.. As a public company, we are incurring and will continue to incur significant legal, insurance, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules of the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market have imposed various requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.. We do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.. We do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Instead, we plan to retain any earnings to maintain and expand our operations. In addition, any future debt financing arrangement may contain terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any return on their investment.. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated by - laws and Delaware law may have anti - takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by - laws and Delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by - laws include provisions that:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tauthorize \"blank check\" preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcreate a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three - year terms;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors;. 72. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprohibit stockholder action by written consent;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovide that our directors may be removed only for cause;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tspecify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpressly authorize our board of directors to have discretion to modify, alter or repeal our amended and restated by - laws; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequire supermajority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by - laws.. These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock.. In addition, because we are incorporated in the State of Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by - laws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.. The recently passed comprehensive tax reform bill could adversely affect our business and financial condition.. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. President signed into law new legislation that significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code).  The newly enacted federal income tax law, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income in respect of net operating losses generated during or after 2018 and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits.  Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.  In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law.  The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse.  We urge you to consult with your legal and tax advisors with respect to this legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our common stock.. 73. Table of Contents. Our ability to use net operating losses and certain tax credit carryforwards may be subject to certain limitations.. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded no income tax benefit for the net operating losses incurred in each year, due to the uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items. The Company has incurred net operating losses (NOLs) since its inception. At December 31, 2017, the Company had federal NOLs of  approximately $34.2 million and state NOLs of approximately $33.9 million. The federal and state NOLs will expire at various dates through 2037. At December 31, 2017, the Company had Federal and State research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $5.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively, which expire at various dates through 2037. Under the newly enacted federal income tax law, federal NOLs incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal NOLs is limited. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change,\" which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation's ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. Our past issuances of stock and other changes in our stock ownership may have resulted in ownership changes within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code; accordingly, our pre-change NOLs may be subject to limitation under Section 382. If we determine that we have not undergone an ownership change, the Internal Revenue Service could challenge our analysis, and our ability to use our NOLs to offset taxable income could be limited by Section 382 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, including in connection with this offering and some of which are outside of our control, could result in ownership changes under Section 382 of the Code further limiting our ability to utilize our NOLs. Our NOLs may also be impaired under state law. Accordingly, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOLs. The Company has determined that ownership changes have occurred through December 31, 2015 and that certain NOLs and research and development tax credit carryforwards will be subject to limitation.  We may also have incurred subsequent ownership changes. Furthermore, our ability to utilize our NOLs is conditioned upon our attaining profitability and generating U.S. federal taxable income. We have incurred net losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future; thus, we do not know whether or when we will generate the U.S. federal taxable income necessary to utilize our NOLs. We have recorded a full valuation allowance related to our NOLs and other deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits of those assets.. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state or federal courts within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the state or federal courts within the State of Delaware will be exclusive forums for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated by - laws or (4) any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity that purchases or otherwise acquires any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition."
