[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. There are many factors that could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership's operating results, financial condition and cash flows. New risks may emerge at any time and the Partnership cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect financial performance. Each of the risks described below could adversely impact the value of the Partnership's common units.. Risks Related to Our Business. We may not have sufficient available cash to pay any quarterly distribution on our common units.. We may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to enable us to pay any distributions to our common unitholders. Substantially all of the cash we have to distribute each quarter depends upon the amount of oil, natural gas and NGL revenues we generate, which is dependent upon the prices that the operators of our properties realize from the sale of oil and natural gas production. In addition, the actual amount of our available cash we will have to distribute each quarter will be reduced by replacement capital expenditures we make, payments in respect of our debt instruments and other contractual obligations, general and administrative expenses and fixed charges and reserves for future operating or capital needs that the Board of Directors may determine are appropriate.. The amount of cash we have available for distribution to holders of our units depends primarily on our cash flow and not solely on profitability, which may prevent us from paying cash distributions during periods when we record net income.. The amount of cash we have available for distribution depends primarily upon our cash flow and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non - cash items. For example, we may have significant capital expenditures in the future. While these items may not affect our profitability in a quarter, they would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution with respect to such quarter. As a result, we may pay cash distributions during periods in which we record net losses for financial accounting purposes and may be unable to pay cash distributions during periods in which we record net income.. Our business is difficult to evaluate because we have a limited financial history.. Kimbell Royalty Partners, LP was formed in October 2015 and we completed our IPO in February 2017. Our Predecessor, Rivercrest Royalties, LLC, was formed in October 2013. We do not have historical financial statements with respect to our mineral and royalty interests for periods prior to their acquisition by the Contributing Parties. As a result, with respect to some of our assets, there is only limited historical financial information available upon which to base an evaluation of our performance.. The amount of our quarterly cash distributions, if any, may vary significantly both quarterly and annually and will be directly dependent on the performance of our business. We will not have a minimum quarterly distribution or employ structures intended to consistently maintain or increase distributions over time and could pay no distribution with respect to any particular quarter.. Investors who are looking for an investment that will pay regular and predictable quarterly distributions should not invest in our common units. Our future business performance may be volatile, and our cash flows may be unstable. Please read \" - All of our revenues are derived from royalty payments that are based on the price at which oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from the acreage underlying our interests is sold. The volatility of these prices due to factors beyond our control greatly affects our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution.\" We do not have a minimum quarterly distribution or employ structures intended to consistently maintain or increase distributions over time. Because our quarterly distributions will significantly correlate to the cash we generate each quarter after payment of our fixed and variable expenses, future quarterly distributions paid to our unitholders will vary significantly from quarter to quarter and may be zero. Please read \"Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Unitholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Cash Distribution Policy and Restrictions on Distributions.\". 30. Table of Contents. Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash, which could limit our ability to grow and make acquisitions.. Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash each quarter. As a result, we will have limited cash available to reinvest in our business or to fund acquisitions, and we will rely primarily upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund our acquisitions and growth capital expenditures. As such, to the extent we are unable to finance growth externally, our distribution policy will significantly impair our ability to grow.. To the extent we issue additional units in connection with any acquisitions or growth capital expenditures or as in - kind distributions, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level. There are no limitations in our partnership agreement on our ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior in right of distributions or liquidation to our common units. The incurrence of commercial borrowings or other debt to finance our growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which, in turn, would reduce the available cash that we have to distribute to our unitholders.. The limited liability company agreement of our General Partner contains restrictive covenants, governance and other provisions that may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.. The limited liability company agreement of our General Partner, which is controlled by our Sponsors, contains provisions that prohibit certain actions without a supermajority vote of at least 662/3% of the members of the Board of Directors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe incurrence of borrowings in excess of 2.5 times our Debt to EBITDAX Ratio for the preceding four quarters;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe reservation of a portion of cash generated from operations to finance acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmodifications to the definition of \"available cash\" in our partnership agreement; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe issuance of any partnership interests that rank senior in right of distributions or liquidation to our common units.. Please read \"The Partnership Agreement - Certain Provisions of the Agreement Governing our General Partner.\". The Board of Directors is made up of nine members. Therefore, the vote of four directors would be sufficient to prevent us from undertaking the items discussed above. These restrictions may limit our ability to obtain future financings and acquire additional oil and gas properties. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations that these restrictions impose on us. Our inability to execute financings or acquire additional properties may materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash available for distribution.. All of our revenues are derived from royalty payments that are based on the price at which oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from the acreage underlying our interests is sold. The volatility of these prices due to factors beyond our control greatly affects our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution.. Our revenues, operating results, cash available for distribution and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs. Historically, oil, natural gas and NGL prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe domestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of prices and expectations about future prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production;. 31. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe price and quantity of foreign imports;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of U.S. domestic production;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical and economic conditions in oil producing regions, including the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability of Iran to increase the export of oil and natural gas upon the relaxation of international sanctions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tspeculative trading in crude oil, natural gas and NGL derivative contracts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of consumer product demand;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tweather conditions and other natural disasters;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trisks associated with operating drilling rigs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttechnological advances affecting energy consumption;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe proximity, cost, availability and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe price and availability of alternative fuels; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toverall domestic and global economic conditions.. These factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty. For example, during the past five years, the posted price for West Texas Intermediate light sweet crude oil, which we refer to as West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\"), has ranged from a low of $26.19 per Bbl in February 2016 to a high of $110.62 per Bbl in September 2013, and the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of $1.49 per MMBtu in March 2016 to a high of $8.15 per MMBtu in February 2014. On December 29, 2017, the WTI posted price for crude oil was $60.46 per Bbl and the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas was $3.69 per MMBtu. The reduction in prices has been caused by many factors, including increases in oil and natural gas production and reserves from unconventional (shale) reservoirs, without an offsetting increase in demand, as well as actions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to maintain or raise production levels. The International Energy Agency forecasts continued low global demand growth in 2017. This environment could cause prices to remain at current levels or to fall to lower levels.. Any substantial decline in the price of oil, natural gas and NGLs or prolonged period of low commodity prices will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution. We may use various derivative instruments in connection with anticipated oil and natural gas sales to minimize the impact of commodity price fluctuations. However, we cannot always hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility. To the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility, or our hedges are not effective, our results of operations and financial position may be diminished.. In addition, lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced economically by our operators. This scenario may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our. 32. Table of Contents. estimated proved reserves, which could negatively impact our borrowing base and our ability to fund our operations. If this occurs or if production estimates change or exploration or development results deteriorate, successful efforts method of accounting principles may require us to write down, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. Our operators could also determine during periods of low commodity prices to shut in or curtail production from wells on our properties. In addition, they could determine during periods of low commodity prices to plug and abandon marginal wells that otherwise may have been allowed to continue to produce for a longer period under conditions of higher prices. Specifically, they may abandon any well if they reasonably believe that the well can no longer produce oil or natural gas in commercially paying quantities.. Our derivative activities could result in financial losses and reduce earnings.. To achieve a more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas, we currently have entered, and may in the future enter, into derivative contracts for a portion of our future oil and natural gas production, including fixed price swaps, collars and basis swaps. We have not designated and do not plan to designate any of our derivative contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and, as a result, record all derivative contracts on our balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current period earnings. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts. Derivative contracts also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduction less than expected;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe counterparty to the derivative contract defaults on its contract obligation; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe actual differential between the underlying price in the derivative contract and actual prices received is materially different from that expected.. In addition, these types of derivative contracts can limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas.. We will be required to take write - downs of the carrying values of our properties if commodity prices decrease to a level such that our future undiscounted cash flows from our properties are less than their carrying value for a significant period of time.. Accounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our properties for possible impairment. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our properties. The net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation for which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10%. To the extent capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment, exceed estimated discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves, the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense. The risk that we will be required to recognize impairments of our oil and natural gas properties increases during periods of low commodity prices. In addition, impairments would occur if we were to experience sufficient downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or the present value of estimated future net revenues. An impairment recognized in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even if higher oil and natural gas prices increase the cost center ceiling applicable to the subsequent period.. No impairment expense was recorded for the period from February 8, 2017 to December 31, 2017. The substantial majority of our proved oil and natural gas properties that were acquired at the time of the IPO were recorded at fair value as of the IPO. In accordance with SEC guidance., management determined that the fair value of the properties acquired at the closing of the IPO clearly exceeded the related full-cost ceiling limitation beyond a reasonable doubt and received an exemption from the SEC to exclude the properties acquired at the closing of the IPO from the ceiling test calculation. This exemption was effective beginning with the period ended March 31, 2017 and remained effective through December 31, 2017. A component of the exemption received from the SEC is that we were required to assess the fair value of these acquired assets at each reporting period through the term of the exemption to ensure that the inclusion of these acquired assets in the full-cost ceiling test would not be appropriate. As of December 31, 2017, management determined that the. 33. Table of Contents. exemption to exclude these acquired assets from the full-cost ceiling test was appropriate. In making this determination, management considered that the value was based on a transaction conducted in a public offering and that the common units issued by the Partnership as consideration for the properties were attributed the same value as those purchased in the Partnership's IPO by third-party investors. Additionally, the fair value of the properties acquired at the closing of our IPO was based on forward strip oil and natural gas pricing existing at the date of the IPO and management affirmed that there has not been a material decline to the fair value of these acquired assets since the IPO. The properties acquired at the closing of our IPO have an unamortized cost at December 31, 2017 of $237.2 million. Had management not affirmed the lack of material change to the fair value, the impairment charge recorded would have been $64.3 million as of December 31, 2017. The Partnership will recognize an impairment in the first quarter of 2018 after the exemption has expired, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken.. No impairment expense was recorded by the Predecessor for the period from January 1, 2017 to February 7, 2017 (the \"Predecessor 2017 Period\"). During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 our Predecessor recorded a non - cash impairment charges of approximately $5.0 million and $28.7 million, respectively, primarily due to changes in reserve values resulting from the reduction in commodity prices and other factors.. We depend on unaffiliated operators for all of the exploration, development and production on the properties in which we own mineral and royalty interests. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from royalty payments made by these operators. A reduction in the expected number of wells to be drilled on the acreage underlying our interests by these operators or the failure of these operators to adequately and efficiently develop and operate the underlying acreage could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash available for distribution.. Because we depend on our third-party operators for all of the exploration, development and production on our properties, we have no control over the operations related to our properties. As of December 31, 2017, we received revenue from over 700 operators. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we received approximately 45.03% of revenues from the top ten operators of our properties. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our Predecessor received approximately 64.2% and 67.8% of its revenues from the top ten operators of its properties, respectively. If these operators do not adequately and efficiently perform operations or act in ways that are beneficial to us, our production and revenues could decline. The operators of our properties are often not obligated to undertake any development activities. In the absence of a specific contractual obligation, any development and production activities will be subject to their sole discretion (subject, however, to certain implied obligations to develop imposed by state law). The operators of our properties could determine to drill and complete fewer wells on our acreage than we currently expect. The success and timing of drilling and development activities on our properties, and whether the operators elect to drill any additional wells on our acreage, depends on a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe capital costs required for drilling activities by the operators of our properties, which could be significantly more than anticipated;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability of the operators of our properties to access capital;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprevailing commodity prices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of suitable drilling equipment, production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe operators' expertise, operating efficiency and financial resources;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tapproval of other participants in drilling wells;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe operators' expected return on investment in wells drilled on our acreage as compared to opportunities in other areas;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe selection of technology;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe selection of counterparties for the marketing and sale of production; and. 34. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe rate of production of the reserves.. The operators may elect not to undertake development activities, or may undertake these activities in an unanticipated fashion, which may result in significant fluctuations in our oil, natural gas and NGL revenues and cash available for distribution. Additionally, if an operator were to experience financial difficulty, the operator might not be able to pay its royalty payments or continue its operations, which could have a material adverse impact on us. Sustained reductions in production by the operators of our properties may also materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash available for distribution.. The development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures from the operators of our properties than we or they currently anticipate.. As of December 31, 2017, 26.5% of our total estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped reserves and may not be ultimately developed or produced by the operators of our properties. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations by the operators of our properties. The reserve data included in the reserve report of our independent petroleum engineer assume that substantial capital expenditures by the operators of our properties are required to develop such reserves. We typically do not have access to the estimated costs of development of these reserves or the scheduled development plans of our operators. We take into consideration the estimated costs of development or the scheduled development plans from any development provisions in the relevant lease agreement and the historical drilling activity, rig locations, production data and permit trends, as well as investor presentations and other public statements of our operators. The development of such reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures from the operators than we anticipate. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves or decreases or continued volatility in commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical for the operators of our properties. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could force us to reclassify certain of our proved reserves as unproved reserves.. We may not be able to terminate our leases if any of the operators of the properties in which we own mineral interests declare bankruptcy, and we may experience delays and be unable to replace operators that do not make royalty payments.. A failure on the part of the operators of the properties in which we own mineral interests to make royalty payments typically gives us the right to terminate the lease, repossess the property and enforce payment obligations under the lease. If we repossessed any of the properties in which we own mineral interests, we would seek a replacement operator. However, we might not be able to find a replacement operator and, if we did, we might not be able to enter into a new lease on favorable terms within a reasonable period of time. In addition, the outgoing operator could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings that could prevent the execution of a new lease or the assignment of the existing lease to another operator. In addition, if we enter into a new lease, the replacement operator may not achieve the same levels of production or sell oil, natural gas or NGLs at the same price as the operator it replaced.. Our future success depends on replacing reserves through acquisitions and the exploration and development activities of the operators of our properties.. Our future success depends upon our ability to acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted, except to the extent that successful exploration or development activities are conducted on our properties or we acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. Aside from acquisitions, we have no control over the exploration and development of our properties. In addition, we do not currently intend to retain cash from our operations for capital expenditures necessary to replace our existing oil and gas reserves or otherwise maintain an asset base. To increase reserves and production, we would need the operators of our properties to undertake replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish these activities.. 35. Table of Contents. Our failure to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions of properties or businesses would slow our growth and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash available for distribution.. We depend in part on acquisitions to grow our reserves, production and cash generated from operations. Our decision to acquire a property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses and seismic data, and other information, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations. The successful acquisition of properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trecoverable reserves;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfuture oil, natural gas and NGL prices and their applicable differentials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelopment plans;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toperating costs; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential environmental and other liabilities.. The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain and we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices, given the nature of our interests. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections are often not performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. Even if we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms. Unless our operators further develop our existing properties, we will depend on acquisitions to grow our reserves, production and cash flow.. There is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry. Competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. Our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and, in some cases, regulatory approvals. Further, these acquisitions may be in geographic regions in which we do not currently hold assets, which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties. In addition, if we acquire interests in new states, we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements. Compliance with regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations on us and our management, cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for non - compliance with such additional legal requirements. Further, the success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing business. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. In addition, potential future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions.. No assurance can be given that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets. Our failure to minimize any unforeseen difficulties could materially adversely affect our financial condition and cash available for distribution. The inability to effectively manage these acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions, which, in turn, could negatively impact our growth and cash available for distribution.. 36. Table of Contents. Any acquisitions of additional mineral and royalty interests that we complete will be subject to substantial risks.. Even if we do make acquisitions that we believe will increase our cash generated from operations, these acquisitions may nevertheless result in a decrease in our cash distributions per unit. Any acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe validity of our assumptions about estimated proved reserves, future production, prices, revenues, capital expenditures and production costs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta decrease in our liquidity by using a significant portion of our cash generated from operations or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur debt to finance acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which any indemnity we receive is inadequate;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmistaken assumptions about the overall cost of equity or debt;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to obtain satisfactory title to the assets we acquire;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tan inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our growing business and assets; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe occurrence of other significant changes, such as impairment of oil and natural gas properties, goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges.. If we are unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms from our Sponsors, the Contributing Parties or third parties, our future growth will be limited.. Our ability to grow depends in part on our ability to make acquisitions that increase our cash generated from our mineral and royalty interests. The acquisition component of our strategy is based, in large part, on our expectation of ongoing acquisitions from industry participants, including our Sponsors and the Contributing Parties. While we believe the Contributing Parties, including affiliates of our Sponsors, will be incentivized through their direct and indirect ownership of common units to offer us the opportunity to acquire additional mineral and royalty interests, including with respect to certain assets for which certain of the Contributing Parties have granted us a right of first offer for a period of three years after the closing of our IPO, should they choose to sell such assets, there can be no assurance that any such offer will be made, and there can be no assurance we will reach agreement on the terms with respect to the assets or any other acquisition opportunities offered to us by any of our Sponsors and the Contributing Parties or be able to obtain financing for such acquisition opportunities. Furthermore, many factors could impair our access to future acquisitions, including a change in control of any of our Sponsors and the Contributing Parties. A material decrease in the sale of oil and natural gas properties by any of our Sponsors and the Contributing Parties or by third parties would limit our opportunities for future acquisitions and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders.. Project areas on our properties, which are in various stages of development, may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities.. Project areas on our properties are in various stages of development, ranging from project areas with current drilling or production activity to project areas that have limited drilling or production history. If the wells in the process of being completed do not produce sufficient revenues or if dry holes are drilled, our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution may be materially adversely affected.. 37. Table of Contents. Our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.. It is not possible to measure underground accumulations of oil or natural gas in an exact way. Oil and natural gas reserve engineering requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices, production levels, ultimate recoveries and operating and development costs. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves, projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be incorrect.. Our and our Predecessor's historical estimates of proved reserves and related valuations as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 were prepared by Ryder Scott, an independent petroleum engineering firm, which conducted a well - by - well review of all of our properties for the period covered by its reserve report using information provided by us. Over time, we may make material changes to reserve estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling, testing and production and changes in prices. Some of our reserve estimates were made without the benefit of a lengthy production history, which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history. In estimating our reserves, we and our reserve engineers make certain assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, including assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices, production levels and operating and development costs. Any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows. Numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based, as described above, often result in the actual quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered being different from our reserve estimates.. The present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated reserves. In accordance with rules established by the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\"), we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the twelve - month average oil and gas index prices, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first - day - of - the - month price for each month, and costs in effect on the date of the estimate, holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general.. SEC rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves in the future.. SEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This requirement has limited and may continue to limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as the operators of our properties pursue their drilling programs. Moreover, we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if those wells are not drilled within the required five - year timeframe. Furthermore, we typically do not have access to the drilling schedules of our operators and make our determinations about their estimated drilling schedules from any development provisions in the relevant lease agreement and the historical drilling activity, rig locations, production data and permit trends, as well as investor presentations and other public statements of our operators.. Restrictions in our secured revolving credit facility and future debt agreements could limit our growth and our ability to engage in certain activities, including our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.. We entered into a $50.0 million secured revolving credit facility in connection with our IPO. The secured revolving credit facility includes an accordion feature permitting aggregate commitments under the facility to be increased up to $100.0 million (subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the procurement of additional commitments from new or existing lenders). Our secured revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets. Our secured revolving credit facility contains various covenants and restrictive provisions that limit our ability to, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur or guarantee additional debt;. 38. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, common units, including if an event of default or borrowing base deficiency exists;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake certain investments and acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur certain liens or permit them to exist;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmerge or consolidate with another company; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttransfer, sell or otherwise dispose of assets.. Our secured revolving credit facility also contains covenants requiring us to maintain the following financial ratios or to reduce our indebtedness if we are unable to comply with such ratios: (i) a Debt to EBITDAX Ratio (as more fully defined in the secured revolving credit facility) of not more than 4.0 to 1.0; and (ii) a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of not less than 1.0 to 1.0. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control. These restrictions may also limit our ability to obtain future financings to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations that the restrictive covenants under our secured revolving credit facility impose on us.. A failure to comply with the provisions of our secured revolving credit facility could result in an event of default, which could enable the lenders to declare, subject to the terms and conditions of our secured revolving credit facility, any outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable. If the payment of the debt is accelerated, cash flows from our operations may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and our unitholders could experience a partial or total loss of their investment. Our secured revolving credit facility contains events of default customary for transactions of this nature, including the occurrence of a change of control. Please read \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Indebtedness - Revolving Credit Agreement.\". Any significant reduction in our borrowing base under our secured revolving credit facility as a result of the periodic borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations.. Our secured revolving credit facility limits the amounts we can borrow up to a borrowing base amount, which the lenders, in their sole discretion, determine on a semi - annual basis based upon projected revenues from the oil and natural gas properties securing our loan. The borrowing base is determined based on our oil and gas properties and the oil and gas properties of our wholly owned subsidiaries. We have non - wholly owned subsidiaries whose assets are not subject to a lien and not included in borrowing base valuations. The lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility. Any increase in the borrowing base requires the consent of the lenders holding 100% of the commitments. If the requisite number of lenders do not agree to an increase, then the borrowing base will be the lowest borrowing base acceptable to such lenders. Decreases in the available borrowing amount could result from declines in oil and natural gas prices, operating difficulties or increased costs, declines in reserves, lending requirements or regulations or certain other circumstances. Outstanding borrowings in excess of the borrowing base must be repaid, or we must pledge other oil and natural gas properties as additional collateral after applicable grace periods. We do not have substantial unpledged properties, and we may not have the financial resources in the future to make mandatory principal prepayments required under our secured revolving credit facility.. Our debt levels may limit our flexibility to obtain additional financing and pursue other business opportunities.. Our existing and future indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired, or such financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us;. 39. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcovenants in our existing and future credit and debt arrangements will require us to meet financial tests that may affect our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business, including possible acquisition opportunities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour access to the capital markets may be limited;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour borrowing costs may increase;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe will need a substantial portion of our cash flow to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions to unitholders; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour debt level will make us more vulnerable than our competitors with less debt to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally.. Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments and/or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, or seeking additional equity capital or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all.. We do not intend to retain cash from our operations for replacement capital expenditures. Unless we replenish our oil and natural gas reserves, our cash generated from operations and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders could be materially adversely affected.. Producing oil and natural gas wells are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our oil and natural gas reserves and the operators' production thereof and our cash generated from operations and ability to pay distributions are highly dependent on the successful development and exploitation of our current reserves. As of December 31, 2017, the average estimated yearly five - year decline rate for our existing proved developed producing reserves is 8.8%. However, the production decline rates of our properties may be significantly higher than currently estimated if the wells on our properties do not produce as expected. We may also not be able to acquire additional reserves to replace the current and future production of our properties at economically acceptable terms, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution.. We are unlikely to be able to sustain or increase distributions without making accretive acquisitions or capital expenditures that maintain or grow our asset base. We will need to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain and grow our asset base, which will reduce our cash available for distribution. We do not intend to retain cash from our operations for replacement capital expenditures primarily due to our expectation that the continued development of our properties and completion of drilled but uncompleted wells by working interest owners will substantially offset the natural production declines from our existing wells.. Over a longer period of time, if we do not set aside sufficient cash reserves or make sufficient expenditures to maintain or grow our asset base, we would expect to reduce our distributions. With our reserves decreasing, if we do not reduce our distributions, then a portion of the distributions may be considered a return of part of the unitholders' investment in us as opposed to a return on the unitholders' investment.. A deterioration in general economic, business or industry conditions would materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash available for distribution.. In recent years, concerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of credit, and slow economic growth in the United States have contributed to economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. Meanwhile, continued hostilities in the Middle East and the. 40. Table of Contents. occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries could adversely affect the economies of the United States and other countries. Concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. With current global economic growth slowing, demand for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid production has, in turn, softened. An oversupply of crude oil in 2015 led to a severe decline in worldwide oil prices. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad deteriorates further, worldwide demand for petroleum products could further diminish, which could impact the price at which oil, natural gas and NGLs from our properties are sold, affect the ability of vendors, suppliers and customers associated with our properties to continue operations and ultimately materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash available for distribution.. Conservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.. Fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy - generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution.. Competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, which may adversely affect our operators' ability to succeed.. The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and the operators of our properties compete with other companies that may have greater resources. Many of these companies explore for and produce oil and natural gas, carry on midstream and refining operations, and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices. Our operators' larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations more easily than our operators can, which would adversely affect our operators' competitive position. Our operators may have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our operators' industry and may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties.. We rely on a few key individuals whose absence or loss could materially adversely affect our business.. Many key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of individuals. We rely on our founders for their knowledge of the oil and natural gas industry, relationships within the industry and experience in identifying, evaluating and completing acquisitions. We have entered into a management services agreement with Kimbell Operating, which has entered into separate services agreements with certain entities controlled by affiliates of our Sponsors and Benny Duncan, pursuant to which they and Kimbell Operating provide management, administrative and operational services to us. In addition, under each of their respective services agreements, affiliates of our Sponsors will identify, evaluate and recommend to us acquisition opportunities and negotiate the terms of such acquisitions. The loss of their services, or the services of one or more members of our executive team or those providing services to us pursuant to a contract, could materially adversely affect our business. Further, we do not maintain \"key person\" life insurance policies on any of our executive team or other key personnel. As a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of these key individuals.. Increased costs of capital could materially adversely affect our business.. Our business, ability to make acquisitions and operating results could be harmed by factors such as the availability, terms and cost of capital or increases in interest rates. Changes in any one or more of these factors could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our access to capital, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, and place us at a competitive disadvantage. A significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results.. Loss of our or our operators' information and computer systems could materially adversely affect our business.. We are dependent on our and our operators' information systems and computer - based programs. If any of such programs or systems were to fail for any reason, including as a result of a cyber - attack, or create erroneous information in our or our operators' hardware or software network infrastructure, possible consequences include loss of communication links and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. In addition to the service providers who provide substantial services to us under our services agreement. 41. Table of Contents. with Kimbell Operating, we rely on third party service providers to perform some of our data entry, investor relations and other functions. If the programs or systems used by our third-party service providers are not adequately functioning, we could experience loss of important data. Any of the foregoing consequences could materially adversely affect our business.. A terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.. Terrorist activities, anti - terrorist activities and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries may adversely affect the United States and global economies. If any of these events occur, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas, potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our operators' services and causing a reduction in our revenues. Oil and natural gas facilities, including those of our operators, could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and if infrastructure integral to our operators is destroyed or damaged, they may experience a significant disruption in their operations. Any such disruption could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution.. Title to the properties in which we have an interest may be impaired by title defects.. We may not elect to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest. Rather, we may rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest. The existence of a material title deficiency can render an interest worthless and can materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash available for distribution. No assurance can be given that we will not suffer a monetary loss from title defects or title failure. Additionally, undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. If there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest, we will suffer a financial loss.. The Contributing Parties have limited indemnity obligations to us for liabilities arising out of the ownership and operation of our assets prior to the closing of our IPO, including title defects.. In connection with our IPO, we entered into a contribution agreement with the Contributing Parties that governs, among other things, their obligation to indemnify us for certain liabilities associated with the entities and assets contributed to us in connection with our IPO. Under the contribution agreement, the Contributing Parties are required, severally but not jointly, to indemnify us (i) for a period of one year following the closing of our IPO, for breaches of specified representations and warranties related to, among other things, (x) their authority to enter into the transactions contemplated by the contribution agreement and (y) the capitalization of the entities that were contributed to us; and (ii) for any federal, state and local income tax liabilities attributable to the ownership and operation of the mineral and royalty interests and the associated entities prior to the closing of our IPO until 30 days after the applicable statute of limitations. In addition, pursuant to the contribution agreement, the Contributing Parties, severally but not jointly, indemnified us for losses arising from certain liens and title defects created during their ownership of the entities and assets contributed to us in connection with our IPO.. Except as otherwise described above, the Contributing Parties are not required to indemnify us for breaches of any other representations and warranties under the contribution agreement, including breaches related to other title matters, consents and permits or compliance with environmental laws, and such other representations and warranties did not survive the closing of our IPO. Moreover, the representations, warranties and indemnities provided by the Contributing Parties are subject to significant limitations, including indemnity caps, and may not protect us against all liabilities or other problems associated with the entities and assets contributed to us. For example, the existence of a material title deficiency covering a material amount of our assets can render a lease worthless and could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution. We do not obtain title insurance covering mineral leaseholds, and our failure to cure any title defects may delay or prevent us from realizing the benefits of ownership of the mineral interest, which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves. Additionally, undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. If there are any title defects, or defects in the assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest, our business, results of operations and cash available for distribution may be adversely affected.. 42. Table of Contents. The indemnities that the Contributing Parties agreed to provide under the contribution agreement may be inadequate to fully compensate us for losses we may suffer or incur as a result of liabilities arising out of the ownership and operation of our assets prior to the closing of our IPO. Even if we are insured or indemnified against such risks, we may be responsible for costs or penalties to the extent our insurers or indemnitors do not fulfill their obligations to us, and the payment of any such costs or penalties could be significant. The occurrence of any losses that are neither indemnified for under the contribution agreement nor covered under our insurance plans could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution. Please read \"Item 13 Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence  - Agreements and Transactions with Affiliates in Connection with our Initial Public Offering - Contribution Agreement - Indemnification.\". The potential drilling locations identified by the operators of our properties are susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.. The ability of the operators of our properties to drill and develop identified potential drilling locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including the availability of capital, construction of infrastructure, inclement weather, regulatory changes and approvals, oil and natural gas prices, costs, drilling results and the availability of water. Further, the potential drilling locations identified by the operators of our properties are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from locations that are ready to drill to locations that will require substantial additional interpretation. The use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable the operators of our properties to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable. Even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist, the operators of our properties may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon - bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, possibly resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well. If the operators of our properties drill additional wells that they identify as dry holes in current and future drilling locations, their drilling success rate may decline and materially harm their business as well as ours.. We cannot assure our unitholders that the analogies our operators draw from available data from the wells on our acreage, more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to their drilling locations. Further, initial production rates reported by our or other operators in the areas in which our reserves are located may not be indicative of future or long - term production rates. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the potential drilling locations our operators have identified will ever be drilled or if our operators will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, the actual drilling activities of the operators of our properties may materially differ from those presently identified, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operation and cash available for distribution.. Acreage must be drilled before lease expiration, generally within three to five years, in order to hold the acreage by production. Our operators' failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in loss of the lease and prospective drilling opportunities.. Leases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres. Any reduction in our operators' drilling programs, either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of drilling rigs, could result in the loss of acreage through lease expirations which may terminate our overriding royalty interests derived from such leases. If our royalties are derived from mineral interests and production or drilling ceases on the leased property, the lease is typically terminated, subject to certain exceptions, and all mineral rights revert back to us and we will have to seek new lessees to explore and develop such mineral interests. Any such losses of our operators or lessees could materially and adversely affect the growth of our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution.. The unavailability, high cost, or shortages of rigs, equipment, raw materials, supplies or personnel may restrict or result in increased costs for operators related to developing and operating our properties.. The oil and natural gas industry is cyclical, which can result in shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, raw materials (particularly sand and other proppants), supplies and personnel. When shortages occur, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment, and supplies increase and demand for, and wage rates of, qualified drilling rig crews also rise with increases in demand. We cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and, if so, what their timing and. 43. Table of Contents. duration will be. In accordance with customary industry practice, the operators of our properties rely on independent third-party service providers to provide many of the services and equipment necessary to drill new wells. If the operators of our properties are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer. In addition, they may not have long - term contracts securing the use of their rigs, and the operator of those rigs may choose to cease providing services to them. Shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, raw materials (particularly sand and other proppants), supplies, personnel, trucking services, tubulars, fracking and completion services and production equipment could delay or restrict our operators' exploration and development operations, which in turn could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution.. The results of exploratory drilling in shale plays will be subject to risks associated with drilling and completion techniques and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production.. The operators of our properties may use the latest drilling and completion techniques in their operations, and these techniques come with inherent risks. Certain of the new techniques that the operators of our properties may adopt, such as horizontal drilling, infill drilling and multi - well pad drilling, may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to, in the case of infill drilling, offset wells being shut in and, in the case of multi - well pad drilling, the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before these wells begin producing. The results of drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer or emerging formations and areas often have limited or no production history and consequently the operators of our properties will be less able to predict future drilling results in these areas.. Ultimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our operators' drilling results are weaker than anticipated or they are unable to execute their drilling program on our properties because of capital constraints, lease expirations, access to gathering systems, or declines in oil and natural gas prices, our operating and financial results in these areas may be lower than we anticipate. Further, as a result of any of these developments we could incur material write - downs of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline, and our results of operations and cash available for distribution could be materially adversely affected.. The marketability of oil and natural gas production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities, certain of which neither we nor the operators of our properties control. If these facilities are unavailable, our operators' operations could be interrupted and our results of operations and cash available for distribution could be materially adversely affected.. The marketability of our operators' oil and natural gas production will depend in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation facilities, including gathering systems, trucks and pipelines, owned by third parties. Neither we nor the operators of our properties control these third party transportation facilities and our operators' access to them may be limited or denied. Insufficient production from the wells on our acreage or a significant disruption in the availability of third party transportation facilities or other production facilities could adversely impact our operators' ability to deliver to market or produce oil and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operators' operations. If they are unable, for any sustained period, to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter production related difficulties, they may be required to shut in or curtail production. In addition, the amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold may be subject to curtailment in certain other circumstances outside of our or our operators' control, such as pipeline interruptions due to maintenance, excessive pressure, inability of downstream processing facilities to accept unprocessed gas, physical damage to the gathering system or transportation system or lack of contracted capacity on such systems. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months. In many cases, we and our operators are provided with limited notice, if any, as to when these curtailments will arise and the duration of such curtailments. Any such shut in or curtailment, or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil and natural gas produced from our acreage, could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution.. 44. Table of Contents. Oil and natural gas operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be burdensome and expensive, and failure to comply could result in significant liabilities, which could reduce our cash available for distribution.. Operations on the properties in which we hold interests are subject to various federal, state and local governmental regulations that may be changed from time to time in response to economic and political conditions. Matters subject to regulation include drilling operations, discharges or releases of pollutants or wastes and production and conservation matters (discussed in more detail below). From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of oil and natural gas. In addition, the production, handling, storage, transportation, remediation, emission and disposal of oil and natural gas, by - products thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and safety and the environment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations by the operators of our properties may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, permit revocations, requirements for additional pollution controls and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of their operations. Moreover, these laws and regulations have continually imposed increasingly strict requirements for water and air pollution control and solid waste management.. Laws and regulations governing exploration and production may also affect production levels. The operators of our properties must comply with federal and state laws and regulations governing conservation matters, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovisions related to the unitization or pooling of the oil and natural gas properties;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe establishment of maximum rates of production from wells;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe spacing of wells;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe plugging and abandonment of wells; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe removal of related production equipment.. Additionally, state and federal regulatory authorities may expand or alter applicable pipeline safety laws and regulations, compliance with which may require increased capital costs on the part of operators and third party downstream natural gas transporters.. The operators of our properties must also comply with laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and market manipulations in energy markets. To the extent the operators of our properties are shippers on interstate pipelines, they must comply with the tariffs of those pipelines and with federal policies related to the use of interstate capacity.. The operators of our properties may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with the governmental laws and regulations described above and are subject to potential fines and penalties if they are found to have violated these laws and regulations. These and other potential regulations could increase the operating costs of the operators and delay production from our properties, which could reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders.. The operators of our properties are subject to complex and evolving environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. As a result, they may incur significant delays, costs and liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.. The operators of our properties may incur significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations applicable to their exploration, development and production activities on our properties. These delays, costs and liabilities could arise under a wide range of federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and worker health and safety. These laws, regulations, and enforcement policies have become increasingly strict over time, resulting in longer waiting periods to receive permits and other regulatory approvals, and we believe this trend will continue. These laws include, but are not limited to, the federal Clean Air Act (and comparable state laws and regulations that impose obligations related to air emissions), the Clean. 45. Table of Contents. Water Act and OPA (and comparable state laws and regulations that impose requirements related to discharges of pollutants into regulated bodies of water), the RCRA (and comparable state laws that impose requirements for the handling and disposal of waste), the CERCLA, also known as the \"Superfund\" law, and the community right to know regulations under Title III of the act (and comparable state laws that regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by our operators or at locations our operators sent waste for disposal and comparable state laws that require organization and/or disclosure of information about hazardous materials our operators use or produce), the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (which establishes workplace standards for the protection of health and safety of employees and requires a hazardous communications program) and the Endangered Species Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (and comparable state laws that seek to ensure activities do not jeopardize endangered or threatened animals, fish, plant species by limiting or prohibiting construction activities in areas that are inhabited by such species and penalizing the taking, killing or possession of migratory birds).. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, and, in some instances, issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations. Additionally, actions taken by federal or state agencies under these laws and regulations, such as the designation of previously unprotected species as being endangered or threatened or the designation of previously unprotected areas as a critical habitat for such species, can cause the operators of our properties to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions.. Strict, joint and several liabilities may be imposed under certain environmental laws, which could cause the operators of our properties to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our operators' actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental and worker health and safety impacts of operations by the operators of our properties. Also, new laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be more stringent and impose unforeseen liabilities, significantly increase our operating or compliance costs, reduce our liquidity, delay or halt our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business. If the operators of our properties are not able to recover the resulting costs through insurance or increased revenues, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Please read \"Business - Regulation\" for a description of the laws and regulations that affect the operators of our properties and that may affect us.. Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.. The operators of our properties use hydraulic fracturing for the completion of their wells. Hydraulic fracturing is a process that involves pumping fluid and proppant at high pressure into a hydrocarbon bearing formation to create and hold open fractures. Those fractures enable gas or oil to move through the formation's pores to the wellbore. Typically, the fluid used in this process is primarily water. In plays where hydraulic fracturing is necessary for successful development, the demand for water may exceed the supply. If the operators of our properties are unable to obtain water to use in their operations from local sources or are unable to effectively utilize flowback water, they may be unable to economically drill for or produce oil and natural gas, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution.. Various federal, state and local initiatives are underway to investigate or regulate hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of new laws or regulations imposing additional permitting, disclosures, restrictions or costs related to hydraulic fracturing or restricting or even banning hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances could make drilling certain wells less economically attractive to or impossible for the operators of our properties, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay cash distributions to our unitholders.. Certain governmental reviews have been conducted or are underway that focus on the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances, including large volume spills and inadequate mechanical integrity of wells. These and other ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for the operators of our properties to perform fracturing and increase the costs of compliance and doing business. Additional legislation or regulation could also make it easier for parties opposing the. 46. Table of Contents. hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. There has also been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, impacts on drinking water supplies, the use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated at the state level implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. The imposition of stringent new regulatory and permitting requirements related to the practice of hydraulic fracturing could significantly increase our cost of doing business, could create adverse effects on our operators, including creating delays related to the issuance of permits and, depending on the specifics of any particular proposal that is enacted, could be material.. State and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the hydraulic fracturing related activities, particularly the disposal of produced water in underground injection wells, and the increased occurrence of seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In some instances, operators of injection wells in the vicinity of seismic events have been ordered to reduce injection volumes or suspend operations. Some state regulatory agencies, including those in Colorado, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas, have modified their regulations to account for induced seismicity. For example, following earthquakes in and around Cushing, Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission announced plans on November 7, 2016, to shut down or reduce the volume of disposal at certain injection wells that discharge into the Arbuckle formation. Regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells and hydraulic fracturing. Such regulations and restrictions could cause delays and impose additional costs and restrictions on the operators of our properties and on their waste disposal activities. Please read \"Business - Regulation\" for a description of the laws and regulations that affect the operators of our properties and that may affect us.. The adoption of climate change legislation and regulations could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that our operators produce.. In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, require preconstruction and operating permits for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain preconstruction permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet \"best available control technology\" standards that will be established on a case - by - case basis. These EPA rulemakings could adversely affect operations on our properties and restrict or delay the ability of our operators to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore oil and natural gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include operations on certain of our properties. These requirements could increase the costs of development and production, reducing the profits available to us and potentially impairing our operator's ability to economically develop our properties. Please read \"Business - Regulation\" for a description of the laws and regulations that affect the operators of our properties and that may affect us.. Efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues. For example, in April 2016, the United States was one of 175 countries to sign the Paris Agreement, which requires member countries to review and \"represent a progression\" in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016. In June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States will withdraw from the Paris Agreement unless it is renegotiated. The State Department informed the United Nations of the United States' withdrawal in August 2017. Under the terms of the Paris Agreement, the earliest possible effective withdrawal date is November 2020. Similar initiatives or regulatory changes could result in increased costs of development and production, reducing the profits available to us and potentially impairing our operators' ability to economically develop our properties.. While Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs. These programs typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. Although it is not possible at. 47. Table of Contents. this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our operators' equipment and operations could require them to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with their operations. In addition, substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas produced from our properties. Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states, as well as state and local climate change initiatives, could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry, and, at this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our business.. Finally, increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other climatic events; if any of these effects were to occur, they could materially adversely affect our properties and operations.. Drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high - risk activities with many uncertainties that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution.. The drilling activities of the operators of our properties will be subject to many risks. For example, we will not be able to assure our unitholders that wells drilled by the operators of our properties will be productive. Drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. The seismic data and other technologies used do not provide conclusive knowledge prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or that it can be produced economically. The costs of exploration, exploitation and development activities are subject to numerous uncertainties beyond our control and increases in those costs can adversely affect the economics of a project. Further, our operators' drilling and producing operations may be curtailed, delayed, canceled or otherwise negatively impacted as a result of other factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunusual or unexpected geological formations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of drilling fluid circulation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttitle problems;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfacility or equipment malfunctions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunexpected operational events;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshortages or delivery delays of equipment and services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse weather conditions.. Any of these risks can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution, environmental contamination or loss of wells and other regulatory penalties. In the event that planned operations, including the drilling of development wells, are delayed or cancelled, or existing wells or development wells have lower than anticipated production due to one or more of the factors above or for any other reason, our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders may be materially adversely affected.. Operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses to the operators of our properties, and any losses could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash available for distribution.. The operators of our properties will be subject to all of the hazards and operating risks associated with drilling for and production of oil and natural gas, including the risk of fire, explosions, blowouts, surface cratering, uncontrollable flows of natural gas, oil and formation water, pipe or pipeline failures, abnormally pressured formations, casing collapses and environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks and ruptures or discharges of toxic gases. In addition, their. 48. Table of Contents. operations will be subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing, including any mishandling, surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids, including chemical additives. The occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to the operators of our properties due to injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean - up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties, suspension of operations and repairs required to resume operations.. If the operators of our properties suspend our right to receive royalty payments due to title or other issues, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution may be adversely affected.. Prior to our acquisition of the assets in connection with our IPO and during the year ended December 31, 2017, record title to the mineral and royalty interests was held by various unrelated entities. At the closing of our IPO and each subsequent acquisition, a significant amount of these mineral and royalty interests were conveyed to us or our subsidiaries as asset assignments, and we or our subsidiaries became the record owner of these interests. Upon such a change in ownership, and at regular intervals pursuant to routine audit procedures at each of our operators otherwise at its discretion, the operator of the underlying property has the right to investigate and verify the title and ownership of mineral and royalty interests with respect to the properties it operates. If any title or ownership issues are not resolved to its reasonable satisfaction in accordance with customary industry standards, the operator may suspend payment of the related royalty. If an operator of our properties is not satisfied with the documentation we provide to validate our ownership, it may place our royalty payment in suspense until such issues are resolved, at which time we would receive in full payments that would have been made during the suspense period, without interest. Certain of our operators impose significant documentation requirements for title transfer and may keep royalty payments in suspense for significant periods of time. During the time that an operator puts our assets in pay suspense, we would not receive the applicable mineral or royalty payment owed to us from sales of the underlying oil or natural gas related to such mineral or royalty interest. If a significant amount of our royalty interests are placed in suspense, our quarterly distribution may be reduced significantly. With each acquisition, we expect the risk of payment suspense to be greatest during the immediately succeeding fiscal quarters due to the number of title transfers that will take place.. Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us. Our General Partner and its affiliates, including our Sponsors and their respective affiliates, have conflicts of interest with us and limited duties to us and our unitholders, and they may favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our unitholders. Additionally, we have no control over the business decisions and operations of our Sponsors and their respective affiliates, which are under no obligation to adopt a business strategy that favors us.. Affiliates of our General Partner own or control up to an aggregate of 23.5% of our common units, and our Sponsors indirectly own and control our General Partner. Our General Partner has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. Although our General Partner has a duty to manage us in a manner that is in, or not adverse to, the best interests of us and our unitholders, the directors and officers of our General Partner also have a duty to manage our General Partner in a manner that is beneficial to Kimbell Holdings and its parents, our Sponsors. Conflicts of interest may arise between our Sponsors and their respective affiliates, including our General Partner, on the one hand, and us and our unitholders, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts, our General Partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates, including our Sponsors and their respective affiliates, over the interests of our unitholders. These conflicts include, among others, the following situations:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tneither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires our Sponsors or the Contributing Parties to pursue a business strategy that favors us or utilizes our assets, which could involve decisions by our Sponsors to undertake acquisition opportunities for themselves or any other investment partnership that they control, and the directors and officers of our Sponsors and the Contributing Parties have a fiduciary duty to make these decisions in the best interests of our Sponsors and such Contributing Parties, which may be contrary to our interests;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour Sponsors may change their strategy or priorities in a way that is detrimental to our future growth and acquisition opportunities;. 49. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmany of the officers and directors of our General Partner are also officers or directors of, and equity owners in, our Sponsors and the Contributing Parties and owe fiduciary duties to our Sponsors, or any other investment partnership that they control, and the Contributing Parties and their respective owners;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour partnership agreement does not limit our Sponsors' or their respective affiliates' ability to compete with us and, subject to the 50% participation right included in the contribution agreement that we entered into with our Sponsors and the Contributing Parties in connection with our IPO, neither our Sponsors nor the Contributing Parties have any obligation to present business opportunities to us, and although certain of the Contributing Parties have granted us a right of first offer for a period of three years after the closing of our IPO with respect to certain mineral and royalty interests in the Permian Basin, the Bakken/Williston Basin and the Marcellus Shale, such Contributing Parties are under no obligation to offer such assets to us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour Sponsors may be constrained by the terms of their current or future debt instruments from taking actions, or refraining from taking actions, that may be in our best interests;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour partnership agreement replaces the fiduciary duties that would otherwise be owed by our General Partner with contractual standards governing its duties, limiting our General Partner's liabilities, and restricting the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that, without these limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texcept in limited circumstances, our General Partner has the power and authority to conduct our business without unitholder approval;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontracts between us, on the one hand, and our General Partner and its affiliates, on the other hand, may not be the result of arm's length negotiations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisputes may arise under agreements we have with our General Partner or its affiliates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour General Partner determines the amount and timing of acquisitions and dispositions, borrowings, issuance of additional partnership securities and the creation, reduction or increase of cash reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour General Partner determines which costs incurred by it or its affiliates are reimbursable by us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour partnership agreement does not restrict our General Partner from causing us to reimburse it or its affiliates for any services rendered to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe have entered into a management services agreement with Kimbell Operating, which has entered into separate services agreements with certain entities controlled by affiliates of our Sponsors and Mr. Duncan, pursuant to which they and Kimbell Operating provide management, administrative and operational services to us, and such entities also provide these services to certain other entities, including certain of the Contributing Parties;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour General Partner intends to limit its liability regarding our contractual and other obligations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour General Partner may exercise its right to call and purchase all of the common units not owned by it and its affiliates if it and its affiliates own more than 80% of our common units;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour General Partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by our General Partner and its affiliates, including under the contribution agreement entered into in connection with our IPO and other agreements with our Sponsors and the Contributing Parties; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour General Partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us.. 50. Table of Contents. Our partnership agreement does not restrict our Sponsors and their respective affiliates or the Contributing Parties from competing with us. Certain of our directors and officers may in the future spend significant time serving, and may have significant duties with, investment partnerships or other private entities that compete with us in seeking out acquisitions and business opportunities and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating time or pursuing business opportunities.. Our partnership agreement provides that our General Partner is restricted from engaging in any business activities other than acting as our General Partner and those activities incidental to its ownership of interests in us. Affiliates of our General Partner are not prohibited from owning projects or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Similarly, our partnership agreement does not limit our Sponsors' or their respective affiliates' ability to compete with us and, subject to the 50% participation right included in the contribution agreement that we entered into with our Sponsors and the Contributing Parties in connection with our IPO, neither our Sponsors nor the Contributing Parties have any obligation to present business opportunities to us.. Affiliates of our Sponsors currently hold interests in, and may make investments in and purchases of, entities that acquire and own mineral and royalty interests. In addition, certain of our officers and directors, including the individuals who control our Sponsors, may in the future hold similar positions with investment partnerships or other private entities that are in the business of identifying and acquiring mineral and royalty interests.  In such capacities, these individuals would likely devote significant time to such other businesses and would be compensated by such other businesses for the services rendered to them. The positions of these directors and officers may give rise to duties that are in conflict with duties owed to us. In addition, these individuals may become aware of business opportunities that may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as the other entities with which they are or may be affiliated. Due to these potential future affiliations, they may have duties to present potential business opportunities to those entities prior to presenting them to us, which could cause additional conflicts of interest. Our Sponsors and their respective affiliates are under no obligation to make any acquisition opportunities available to us, except as provided for under the contribution agreement entered into in connection with our IPO.. Under the terms of our partnership agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, does not apply to our General Partner or any of its affiliates, including its executive officers and directors, our Sponsors and their respective affiliates or the Contributing Parties. Any such person or entity that becomes aware of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for us does not have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to us. Any such person or entity is not liable to us or to any limited partner for breach of any fiduciary duty or other duty by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to another person or entity or does not communicate such opportunity or information to us. This may create actual and potential conflicts of interest between us and affiliates of our General Partner and result in less than favorable treatment of us and holders of our common units.. Our General Partner intends to limit its liability regarding our obligations.. Our General Partner intends to limit its liability under contractual arrangements between us and third parties so that the counterparties to such arrangements have recourse only against our assets, and not against our General Partner or its assets. Our General Partner may therefore cause us to incur indebtedness or other obligations that are nonrecourse to our General Partner. Our partnership agreement permits our General Partner to limit its liability, even if we could have obtained more favorable terms without the limitation on liability. In addition, we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify our General Partner to the extent that it incurs obligations on our behalf. Any such reimbursement or indemnification payments would reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders.. Neither we, our General Partner nor our subsidiaries have any employees, and we rely solely on Kimbell Operating to manage and operate, or arrange for the management and operation of, our business. The management team of Kimbell Operating, which includes the individuals who will manage us, also provides substantially similar services to other entities and thus is not solely focused on our business.. Neither we, our General Partner nor our subsidiaries have any employees, and we rely solely on Kimbell Operating to manage us and operate our assets. In connection with our IPO, we entered into a management services agreement with Kimbell Operating, which entered into separate services agreements with certain entities controlled by. 51. Table of Contents. affiliates of our Sponsors and Mr. Duncan, pursuant to which they and Kimbell Operating provide management, administrative and operational services to us.. Kimbell Operating also provides substantially similar services and personnel to other entities, including certain of the Contributing Parties, and, as a result, may not have sufficient human, technical and other resources to provide those services at a level that it would be able to provide to us if it did not provide similar services to these other entities. Additionally, Kimbell Operating may make internal decisions on how to allocate its available resources and expertise that may not always be in our best interest compared to those of other entities or other affiliates of our General Partner. There is no requirement that Kimbell Operating favor us over these other entities in providing its services. If the employees of Kimbell Operating do not devote sufficient attention to the management and operation of our business, our financial results may suffer and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders may be reduced.. Our partnership agreement replaces fiduciary duties applicable to a corporation with contractual duties and restricts the remedies available to holders of our common units for actions taken by our General Partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.. Our partnership agreement contains provisions that replace fiduciary duties applicable to a corporation with contractual duties and restrict the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our General Partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty under state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement provides that:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhenever our General Partner (acting in its capacity as our General Partner), the Board of Directors or any committee thereof (including the conflicts committee) makes a determination or takes, or declines to take, any other action in their respective capacities, our General Partner, the Board of Directors and any committee thereof (including the conflicts committee), as applicable, is required to make such determination, or take or decline to take such other action, in good faith, meaning that it subjectively believed that the decision was in, or not adverse to, our best interests, and, except as specifically provided by our partnership agreement, will not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by our partnership agreement, Delaware law or any other law, rule or regulation or at equity;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour General Partner will not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as a general partner so long as such decisions are made in good faith;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour General Partner and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us or our limited partners resulting from any act or omission unless there has been a final and non - appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that our General Partner or its officers and directors, as the case may be, acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the conduct was unlawful; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour General Partner will not be in breach of its obligations under the partnership agreement (including any duties to us or our unitholders) if a transaction with an affiliate or the resolution of a conflict of interest is:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tapproved by the conflicts committee of the Board of Directors, although our General Partner is not obligated to seek such approval;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tapproved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding common units, excluding any common units owned by our General Partner and its affiliates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdetermined by the Board of Directors to be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from third parties; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdetermined by the Board of Directors to be fair and reasonable to us, taking into account the totality of the relationships among the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us.. 52. Table of Contents. In connection with a situation involving a transaction with an affiliate or a conflict of interest, any determination by our General Partner or the conflicts committee must be made in good faith. If an affiliate transaction or the resolution of a conflict of interest is not approved by our common unitholders or the conflicts committee and the Board of Directors determines that the resolution or course of action taken with respect to the affiliate transaction or conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in the third and fourth sub bullet points above, then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, the Board of Directors acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or the partnership challenging such determination, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption.. Our partnership agreement replaces our General Partner's fiduciary duties to holders of our common units with contractual standards governing its duties.. Our partnership agreement contains provisions that eliminate the fiduciary standards to which our General Partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law and replaces those duties with several different contractual standards. For example, our partnership agreement permits our General Partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our General Partner, free of any duties to us and our unitholders other than the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which means that a court will enforce the reasonable expectations of the partners where the language in the partnership agreement does not provide for a clear course of action. This provision entitles our General Partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires and relieves it of any duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or our limited partners. Examples of decisions that our General Partner may make in its individual capacity include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thow to allocate corporate opportunities among us and its other affiliates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhether to exercise its limited call right;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhether to seek approval of the resolution of a conflict of interest by the conflicts committee of the Board of Directors or by the unitholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thow to exercise its voting rights with respect to the units it owns;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhether to sell or otherwise dispose of any units or other partnership interests it owns; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhether or not to consent to any merger or consolidation of the partnership or amendment to the partnership agreement.. By purchasing a common unit, a common unitholder agrees to become bound by the provisions in the partnership agreement, including the provisions discussed above.. Holders of our common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our General Partner or its directors, which could reduce the price at which our common units will trade.. Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, our unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management's decisions regarding our business. Our unitholders have no right on an annual or ongoing basis to elect our General Partner or its Board of Directors. The Board of Directors, including the independent directors, is chosen entirely by our Sponsors, as a result of such Sponsors controlling our General Partner, and not by our unitholders. Please read \"Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence.\" Unlike publicly traded corporations, we will not conduct annual meetings of our unitholders to elect directors or conduct other matters routinely conducted at annual meetings of stockholders of corporations. As a result of these limitations, the price at which our common units will trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price.. 53. Table of Contents. Even if holders of our common units are dissatisfied, they cannot initially remove our General Partner without its consent.. If our unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our General Partner, they will have limited ability to remove our General Partner. Our General Partner may not be removed unless such removal is both (i) for cause and (ii) approved by the vote of the holders of not less than 662/3% of all outstanding common units. Affiliates of our General Partner own or control an aggregate of 23.5% of our common units, and our Sponsors indirectly own and control our General Partner.. Our partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20% or more of our common units (other than our General Partner and its affiliates, the Contributing Parties and their respective affiliates and permitted transferees).. Our partnership agreement restricts unitholders' voting rights by providing that any units held by a person that owns 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding, other than our General Partner, its affiliates and their transferees, the Contributing Parties and their respective affiliates and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the Board of Directors, may not vote on any matter. Our partnership agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of common unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting the ability of our common unitholders to influence the manner or direction of management.. Cost reimbursements due to our General Partner and its affiliates for services provided to us or on our behalf will reduce cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Our partnership agreement does not set a limit on the amount of expenses for which our General Partner and its affiliates may be reimbursed. The amount and timing of such reimbursements will be determined by our General Partner.. Prior to paying any distribution on our common units, we will reimburse our General Partner and its affiliates, including Kimbell Operating pursuant to its management services agreement discussed below, for all expenses they incur and payments they make on our behalf. Our partnership agreement does not set a limit on the amount of expenses for which our General Partner and its affiliates may be reimbursed. These expenses include salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other amounts paid to persons who perform services for us or on our behalf and expenses allocated to our General Partner by its affiliates. Our partnership agreement provides that our General Partner will determine the expenses that are allocable to us. The reimbursement of expenses and payment of fees, if any, to our General Partner and its affiliates will reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Please read \"Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Unitholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities -  Cash Distribution Policy and Restrictions on Distributions.\". In connection with the closing of our IPO, we entered into a management services agreement with Kimbell Operating, which entered into separate services agreements with certain entities controlled by affiliates of our Sponsors and Mr. Duncan, pursuant to which they and Kimbell Operating provide management, administrative and operational services to us. Amounts paid to Kimbell Operating and such other entities under their respective services agreements will reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Please read \"Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence  - Agreements and Transactions with Affiliates in Connection with our Initial Public Offering - Management Services Agreements.\". Our General Partner interest or the control of our General Partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.. Our General Partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party without the consent of our unitholders. Furthermore, our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of the owner of our General Partner to transfer its membership interests in our General Partner to a third party. After any such transfer, the new member or members of our General Partner would then be in a position to replace the Board of Directors and executive officers of our General Partner with its own designees and thereby exert significant control over the decisions taken by the Board of Directors and executive officers of our General Partner. This effectively permits a \"change of control\" without the vote or consent of the unitholders.. 54. Table of Contents. Unitholders may have liability to repay distributions and in certain circumstances may be personally liable for the obligations of the partnership.. Under certain circumstances, unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under Section 17 - 607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (the \"Delaware Act\"), we may not pay a distribution to our unitholders if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount. Liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities that are non - recourse to the partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted.. A limited partner that participates in the control of our business within the meaning of the Delaware Act may be held personally liable for our obligations under the laws of Delaware, to the same extent as our General Partner. This liability would extend to persons who transact business with us under the reasonable belief that the limited partner is a general partner. Neither our partnership agreement nor the Delaware Act specifically provides for legal recourse against our General Partner if a limited partner were to lose limited liability through any fault of our General Partner.. Increases in interest rates may cause the market price of our common units to decline.. While interest rates have been at record low levels in recent years, this low interest rate environment likely will not continue indefinitely. An increase in interest rates may cause a corresponding decline in demand for equity investments in general, and in particular, for yield - based equity investments such as our common units. Any such increase in interest rates or reduction in demand for our common units resulting from other relatively more attractive investment opportunities may cause the trading price of our common units to decline.. Our General Partner has a call right that may require unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price.. If at any time our General Partner and its affiliates (including our Sponsors and their respective affiliates) own more than 80% of our common units, our General Partner will have the right, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, but not the obligation, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than the then - current market price of the common units, as calculated in accordance with our partnership agreement. As a result, unitholders may be required to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return or a negative return on their investment. Unitholders may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their units. Our General Partner is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the value of the common units to be repurchased by it upon exercise of the limited call right. There is no restriction in our partnership agreement that prevents our General Partner from causing us to issue additional common units and then exercising its call right. If our General Partner exercised its limited call right, the effect would be to take us private and, if the units were subsequently deregistered, we would no longer be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Upon the completion of our IPO, affiliates of our General Partner own or control up to an aggregate of 23.5% of our common units, and our Sponsors will indirectly own and control our General Partner.. We may issue additional common units and other equity interests without unitholder approval, which would dilute existing unitholder ownership interests.. Under our partnership agreement, we are authorized to issue an unlimited number of additional interests, including common units, without a vote of the unitholders. The issuance by us of additional common units or other equity interests of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe proportionate ownership interest of unitholders in us immediately prior to the issuance will decrease;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe amount of cash distributions on each common unit may decrease;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ratio of our taxable income to distributions may increase;. 55. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe relative voting strength of each previously outstanding common unit may be diminished; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe market price of the common units may decline.. There are no limitations in our partnership agreement on our ability to issue units ranking senior in right of distributions or liquidation to our common units.. In accordance with Delaware law and the provisions of our partnership agreement, we may issue additional partnership interests that rank senior in right of distributions, liquidation or voting to our common units. The issuance by us of units of senior rank may (i) reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for distribution to our common unitholders; (ii) diminish the relative voting strength of the total common units outstanding as a class; or (iii) subordinate the claims of the common unitholders to our assets in the event of our liquidation.. The market price of our common units could be materially adversely affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common units in the public or private markets, including sales by our Sponsors and the Contributing Parties.. As a result of our IPO, we had 16,332,708 common units outstanding. As of December 31, 2017, we had 16,509,799 common units outstanding. Sales by holders of a substantial number of our common units in the public markets, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common units or could impair our ability to obtain capital through an offering of equity securities. In addition, the Contributing Parties have registration rights.. The price of our common units may fluctuate significantly, and unitholders could lose all or part of their investment.. The market price of our common units may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in commodity prices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpublic reaction to our press releases, announcements and filings with the SEC;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in broader securities market prices and volumes, particularly among securities of oil and natural gas companies and securities of publicly traded limited partnerships and limited liability companies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in market valuations of similar companies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdepartures of key personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcommencement of or involvement in litigation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvariations in our quarterly results of operations or those of other oil and natural gas companies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in general economic conditions, financial markets or the oil and natural gas industry;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or other transactions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvariations in the amount of our quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common units or changes in their recommendations and estimates of our financial performance;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfuture sales of our common units; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe other factors described in these \"Risk Factors.\". 56. Table of Contents. We have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of being a publicly traded partnership.. As a publicly traded partnership, we have and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur prior to our IPO. In addition, the Sarbanes - Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes - Oxley Act\") and the Dodd - Frank Act of 2010, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\"), require, or will require, publicly traded entities to maintain various corporate governance practices that further increase our costs. Before we are able to pay distributions to our unitholders, we must first pay our expenses, including the costs of being a publicly traded partnership and other operating expenses. As a result, the amount of cash we have available for distribution to our unitholders will be affected by our expenses, including the costs associated with being a publicly traded partnership.. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain disclosure requirements that apply to other public companies.. We are an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Act (\"JOBS Act\"). For as long as we are an emerging growth company, which may be up to five full fiscal years, unlike other public companies, we will not be required to, among other things, (1) provide an auditor's attestation report on the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act, (2) comply with any new requirements adopted by the PCAOB requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer, (3) comply with any new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012 unless the SEC determines otherwise or (4) provide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies.. In addition, Section 102 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \"emerging growth company\" can use the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An \"emerging growth company\" can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we choose to \"opt out\" of such extended transition period, and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non - emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential unitholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our units.. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a publicly traded partnership. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We cannot be certain that our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls are or will be successful, able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or able to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act. For example, Section 404 requires us, among other things, to annually review and report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. However, for as long as we are an \"emerging growth company\" under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain effective internal controls, or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving our internal controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common units.. The NYSE does not require a publicly traded partnership like us to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements.. Because we are a publicly traded partnership, the NYSE does not require us to have, and we do not have, a majority of independent directors on our Board of Directors or to establish a compensation committee or a nominating and corporate governance committee. Additionally, any future issuance of common units or other securities, including to. 57. Table of Contents. affiliates, will not be subject to the NYSE's shareholder approval rules that apply to corporations. Accordingly, unitholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of certain corporations that are subject to all of the NYSE's corporate governance requirements. Please read \"Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.\". Our partnership agreement includes exclusive forum, venue and jurisdiction provisions. By purchasing a common unit, a limited partner is irrevocably consenting to these provisions regarding claims, suits, actions or proceedings and submitting to the exclusive jurisdiction of Delaware courts.. Our partnership agreement is governed by Delaware law. Our partnership agreement includes exclusive forum, venue and jurisdiction provisions designating Delaware courts as the exclusive venue for most claims, suits, actions and proceedings involving us or our officers, directors and employees. By purchasing a common unit, a limited partner is irrevocably consenting to these provisions regarding claims, suits, actions or proceedings and submitting to the exclusive jurisdiction of Delaware courts. These provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us and our General Partner's officers and directors.. If a unitholder is an ineligible holder, the common units of such unitholder may be subject to redemption.. We have adopted certain requirements regarding those investors who may own our common units. Ineligible holders are limited partners whose nationality, citizenship or other related status would create a substantial risk of cancellation or forfeiture of any property in which we have an interest, as determined by our General Partner with the advice of counsel. If a unitholder is an ineligible holder, in certain circumstances as set forth in our partnership agreement, the units held by such unitholder may be redeemed by us at the then - current market price. The redemption price will be paid in cash or by delivery of a promissory note, as determined by our General Partner.. Tax Risks to Common Unitholders. Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, as well as our not being subject to a material amount of entity - level taxation by individual states. If the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or we were to become subject to entity - level taxation for state tax purposes, then our cash available for distribution to our unitholders could be substantially reduced.. The anticipated after - tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.. Despite the fact that we are organized as a limited partnership under Delaware law, we would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless we satisfy a \"qualifying income\" requirement. Based upon our current operations, we believe we satisfy the qualifying income requirement. However, we have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the IRS on this or any other matter affecting us. A change in our business or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity.. If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently 21.0%. Distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to our unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. In addition, changes in current state law may subject us to additional entity - level taxation by individual states. Several states have subjected, or are evaluating ways to subject, partnerships to entity - level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation. Imposition of any such taxes may substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Therefore, treatment of us as a corporation or the assessment of a material amount of entity - level taxation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after - tax return to the unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units.. 58. Table of Contents. The recently enacted 20% deduction for certain pass-through income may not be available for our unitholders' allocable share of our net income, in which case our unitholders' tax liability with respect to ownership and disposition of our units may be materially higher than if the deduction is available.. Pursuant to the recently enacted tax reform law known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"), for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and ending on or before December 31, 2025, an individual taxpayer may generally claim a deduction in the amount of 20% of its allocable share of certain publicly traded partnership income, including generally, among other items, the net amount of its items of income, gain, deduction, and loss from a publicly traded partnership's U.S. trade or business. Because we own only passive mineral and royalty interests, we may not be viewed as engaged in a U.S. trade or business within the meaning of the new law. Therefore, most or all of the income that we now generate, or will generate in the future, may not be qualifying publicly traded partnership income eligible for the 20% deduction. Thus, our unitholders may not be able to claim the 20% deduction on any income allocated from us, and any such claim may be successfully challenged by the IRS. We are continuing to evaluate the extent to which we may qualify for the deduction and possible actions to address the issue. If the deduction is not available, our unitholders' tax liability from ownership and disposition of our units may be materially higher than if the deduction is available. We urge our unitholders to consult with their tax advisors regarding the availability of the 20% deduction on any income allocated from us. The TCJA is complex and far-reaching and we have not completed our analysis of the impact its enactment has on us. There may be other material adverse effects resulting from the TCJA that we have not identified and that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.. The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes or differing interpretations, possibly applied on a retroactive basis.. The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time. For example, from time to time, the President and members of Congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships, including elimination of partnership tax treatment for publicly traded partnerships. Any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be retroactively applied and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to meet the exception to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.. On January 24, 2017, the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury published in the Federal Register final regulations (the \"Final Regulations\") regarding qualifying income under Section 7704(d)(1)(E) of the Code. The Final Regulations apply to taxable years beginning after January 19, 2017. The Final Regulations provide that income earned from a royalty interest is qualifying income. Under current law and the Final Regulations, we believe that our royalty income is qualifying income and that we satisfy the qualifying income requirement for us to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, there are no assurances that current law or the Final Regulations will not be revised to take a position that is contrary to our interpretation.. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or any other proposals will ultimately be enacted or adopted. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units.. If the IRS were to contest the federal income tax positions we take, it may adversely impact the market for our common units, and the costs of any such contest would reduce cash available for distribution to our unitholders.. We have not requested a ruling from the IRS with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or any other matter affecting us or our unitholders. The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the conclusions of our counsel expressed in the prospectus for our IPO or from the positions we take. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of our counsel's conclusions or the positions we take. A court may not agree with some or all of our counsel's conclusions or positions we take. Any contest with the IRS may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which they trade. Moreover, the costs of any contest between us and the IRS will result in a reduction in cash available for distribution to our unitholders and thus will be borne indirectly by our unitholders.. 59. Table of Contents. Our unitholders are required to pay income taxes on their share of our taxable income even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us. A unitholder's share of our taxable income, and its relationship to any distributions we make, may be affected by a variety of factors, including our economic performance, transactions in which we engage or changes in law and may be substantially different from any estimate we make in connection with a unit offering.. A unitholder's allocable share of our taxable income will be taxable to it, which may require the unitholder to pay federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes, even if the unitholder receives cash distributions from us that are less than the actual tax liability that results from that income or no cash distributions at all.. A unitholder's share of our taxable income, and its relationship to any distributions we make, may be affected by a variety of factors, including our economic performance, which may be affected by numerous business, economic, regulatory, legislative, competitive and political uncertainties beyond our control, and certain transactions in which we might engage.  For example, we may engage in transactions that produce substantial taxable income allocations to some or all of our unitholders without a corresponding increase in cash distributions to our unitholders, such as a sale or exchange of assets, the proceeds of which are reinvested in our business or used to reduce our debt, or an actual or deemed satisfaction of our indebtedness for an amount less than the adjusted issue price of the debt.  A unitholder's ratio of its share of taxable income to the cash received by it may also be affected by changes in law.  For instance, under the TCJA, the net interest expense deductions of certain business entities, including us, are limited to 30% of such entity's \"adjusted taxable income,\" which is generally taxable income with certain modifications.  If the limit applies, a unitholder's taxable income allocations will be more (or its net loss allocations will be less) than would have been the case absent the limitation.. From time to time, in connection with an offering of our units, we may state an estimate of the ratio of federal taxable income to cash distributions that a purchaser of units in that offering may receive in a given period.  These estimates depend in part on factors that are unique to the offering with respect to which the estimate is stated, so the expected ratio applicable to other units will be different, and in many cases less favorable, than these estimates.  Moreover, even in the case of units purchased in the offering to which the estimate relates, the estimate may be incorrect, due to the uncertainties described above, challenges by the IRS to tax reporting positions which we adopt, or other factors.  The actual ratio of taxable income to cash distributions could be higher or lower than expected, and any differences could be material and could materially affect the value of the common units.. Tax gain or loss on disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected.. If a unitholder sells its common units, it will recognize a gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the amount realized and its tax basis in those common units. Because distributions in excess of a unitholder's allocable share of our net taxable income decreases the unitholder's tax basis in its common units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the units the unitholder sells will, in effect, become taxable income to the unitholder if the unitholder sell such units at a price greater than its tax basis in those units, even if the price the unitholder receives is less than its original cost. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items, including depreciation and depletion recapture. In addition, because the amount realized includes a unitholder's share of our nonrecourse liabilities, if a unitholder sells its common units, the unitholder may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash the unitholder receives from the sale.. Tax - exempt entities and non - U.S. persons face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.. Investment in common units by tax - exempt entities, such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts or annuities known as IRAs, and non - U.S. persons raises issues unique to them. For example, a portion of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax, including IRAs and other retirement plans, may be unrelated business taxable income and may be taxable to them. Under the TCJA, an exempt organization will be required to independently compute its UBTI from each separate unrelated trade or business which may prevent an exempt organization from utilizing losses we allocate to the organization against the organization's UBTI from other sources and vice versa. Distributions to non - U.S. persons will be subject to withholding taxes imposed at the highest effective tax rate applicable to such non - U.S. persons, and each non - U.S. person may be required to file U.S. federal income tax returns and. 60. Table of Contents. pay tax on their share of our taxable income if it is treated as income effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business (\"effectively connected income\").. Under the TCJA, if a unitholder sells or otherwise disposes of a common unit, the transferee is required to withhold 10.0% of the amount realized by the transferor unless the transferor certifies that it is not a foreign person, and we are required to deduct and withhold from the transferee amounts that should have been withheld by the transferee but were not withheld. However, the Department of the Treasury and the IRS have determined that this withholding requirement should not apply to any disposition of a publicly traded interest in a publicly traded partnership (such as us) until regulations or other guidance have been issued clarifying the application of this withholding requirement to dispositions of interests in publicly traded partnerships. Accordingly, while this new withholding requirement does not currently apply to interests in us, there can be no assurance that such requirement will not apply in the future.. Unitholders that are a tax-exempt entities or non - U.S. persons should consult a tax advisor before investing in our common units.. We will treat each purchaser of common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the common units actually purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of our common units.. Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of our common units, and because of other reasons, we will adopt depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury regulations (\"Treasury Regulations\"). Our counsel is unable to opine as to the validity of this approach. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to unitholders. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from unitholders' sales of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to unitholders' tax returns.. We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our common units each month based upon the ownership of our common units on the first business day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.. We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first business day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. Although simplifying conventions are contemplated by the Code and most publicly traded partnerships use similar simplifying conventions, the use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing Treasury Regulations. The U.S. Treasury Department recently adopted final Treasury Regulations allowing similar monthly simplifying conventions. However, the final Treasury Regulations do not specifically authorize the use of the proration method we have adopted. If the IRS were to challenge our proration method, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.. If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, it may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us, in which case our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced.. Pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, it may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from us. We will generally have the ability to shift any such tax liability to our unitholders in accordance with their interests in us during the year under audit, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so under all circumstances. As a result, our current unitholders may bear some or all of the tax liability resulting from such audit adjustments, even if such unitholders did not own units in us during the year under audit. If we are required to make payments of taxes, penalties and interest resulting from audit adjustments, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced.. In the event the IRS makes an audit adjustment to our income tax returns and we do not or cannot shift the liability to our unitholders in accordance with their interests in us during the year under audit, we will generally have the ability to request that the IRS reduce the determined underpayment by reducing the suspended passive loss carryovers of our. 61. Table of Contents. unitholders (without any compensation from us to such unitholders), to the extent such underpayment is attributable to a net decrease in passive activity losses allocable to certain partners. Such reduction, if approved by the IRS, will be binding on any affected unitholders.. A unitholder whose common units are loaned to a \"short seller\" to cover a short sale of common units may be considered as having disposed of those common units. If so, he would no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.. Because a unitholder whose common units are loaned to a \"short seller\" to cover a short sale of common units may be considered as having disposed of the loaned common units, he may no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan to the short seller, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those common units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Our unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to consult a tax advisor to discuss whether it is advisable to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from loaning their common units.. Unitholders will likely be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in states where they do not live as a result of investing in our common units.. In addition to federal income taxes, unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes, including state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or own property now or in the future, even if they do not live in any of those jurisdictions. We own assets and conduct business in 20 states, many of which impose a personal income tax and also impose income taxes on corporations and other entities. Unitholders may be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in these jurisdictions. Further, unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. As we make acquisitions or expand our business, we may own assets or conduct business in additional states or foreign jurisdictions that impose a personal income tax.
