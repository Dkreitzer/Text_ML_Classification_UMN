[1] "ITEM 1.A.  RISK FACTORS. Our business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks and uncertainties set forth below, as well as in any amendments or updates reflected in subsequent filings with the SEC. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes.. Risks Related to the Specialty Pharmacy Industry. Our failure to anticipate or appropriately adapt to changes or trends within the specialty pharmacy industry could have a significant negative impact on our ability to compete successfully.. The specialty pharmacy industry is growing and evolving rapidly. Any significant shifts in the structure of the specialty pharmacy industry or the healthcare products and services industry in general could alter the industry dynamics and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain customers. These changes or trends could result from, among other things, a large intra- or inter-industry merger, a new entrant in the specialty pharmacy business, changes in the pricing or distribution model for specialty drugs, changes to the manner in which healthcare products or services are contracted for, a slowdown in the biotechnology pharmaceutical pipeline in our areas of expertise, consolidation of shipping carriers, or the necessary changes or unintended consequences of the Health Reform Laws or future regulatory changes. Furthermore, changes in political, economic and regulatory influences, as well as industry-wide changes in business practices, including with respect to the imposition of direct and indirect remuneration (\"DIR\") fees by PBMs, may significantly affect our business. Our failure to successfully anticipate and respond to, or appropriately adapt to, evolving industry conditions or any of these changes or trends, none of which are within our control, in a timely and effective manner could have a significant negative impact on our competitive position and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. 22. Table of Contents. Significant and increasing pressure from third-party payers to limit reimbursements and the impact of high-cost specialty drugs could materially adversely impact our profitability, results of operations and financial condition.. The continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, PBMs, government programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state funded programs), and other third-party payers to limit pharmacy reimbursements may adversely impact our profitability. While manufacturers have increased the price of drugs, payers have generally decreased reimbursement rates as a percentage of drug cost.. We expect pricing pressures from third-party payers to continue given the high and increasing costs of specialty drugs. As a result of this industry-wide pressure, we also may see profit margins on our contracts compress, which may adversely affect our profitability.. PBMs:. Reimbursements received from PBMs are determined pursuant to agreements. Should PBMs seek to negotiate reduced reimbursement rates or to adjust reimbursement rates downward, this could negatively impact our profitability. In addition, we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in networks of pharmacy providers to comply with PBM demands. We also may elect not to continue or enter into participation in a pharmacy provider network if reimbursements are too low. As a result, we may lose sales, and if we are unable to replace any such lost sales, either through an increase in other sales or through participation in other pharmacy provider networks, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.. Medicare and Medicaid:. Reimbursement from government programs is subject to a myriad of requirements, including but not limited to statutory and regulatory, administrative rulings, interpretations, retroactive payment adjustments, governmental funding restrictions, and changes to, or introduction of, legislation, all of which may materially affect the amount and timing of reimbursement payments to us. These changes may reduce our revenue and profitability on services provided to Medicare and Medicaid patients and increase our working capital requirements.. Furthermore, the utilization of Medicare Part D by cash and state Medicaid customers has resulted in increased utilization and decreased pharmacy gross margin rates. In addition, changes to Medicare Part D, such as the elimination of the tax deductibility of the retiree drug subsidy payment received by sponsors of retiree drug plans, could result in our PBM clients deciding to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their Medicare-eligible members. To the extent this occurs, the adverse effects of increasing customer migration into Medicare Part D may outweigh the benefits we realize from the growth of our Medicare Part D business.. Given the significant competition in the industry, we have limited bargaining power to counter payer demands for reduced reimbursement rates. If we are unable to negotiate for acceptable reimbursement rates or replace unfavorable contracts with new business on acceptable terms, our revenues and business could be adversely affected. Should we experience a loss of sales as a result of reduced reimbursement rates and are unable to appropriately adjust staffing levels in a timely and efficient manner, this may negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations.. In response to rising specialty drug prices, payers may also demand that we provide additional services, enhanced service levels and other cost savings to help mitigate the increase in drug costs. Additional services with minimal or no service fees would adversely impact our profitability. Since data-management technology and software make it challenging for us to prove specific cost savings to payers, we may be unable to demand additional service fees to offset the cost of additional services. Our inability or failure to demonstrate cost efficiencies could adversely impact a payer's willingness to engage us, exclusively or at all, as a specialty pharmacy in the face of rising drug costs.. 23. Table of Contents. The amount of DIR fees charged by payers, as well as the timing of assessing such fees and the methodology in calculating such fees, may have a material adverse impact on our financial performance and, to the extent such fees are material, may limit our ability to provide accurate financial guidance for future periods.. Some payers charge certain DIR fees, often calculated and charged several months after adjudication of a claim, which adversely impacts our profitability. DIR fees is a term used by CMS to address price concessions that ultimately impact the prescription drug costs of Medicare Part D plans, but are not captured at the point of sale. Further, the timing of assessments, changes in the manner in which DIR fees are assessed and methodology in computing DIR fees may materially impact our ability to provide accurate financial guidance to investors and analysts, and may result in a future change in the estimated DIR fees we have recognized. In addition, as reimbursement pressure increases throughout the industry, the amount of DIR fees assessed may increase, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations.. If our relationship with any of our key pharmaceutical manufacturers deteriorates, or if we are unable to create new significant relationships with other pharmaceutical manufacturers, we could lose all or a significant portion of our access to existing and future specialty drugs.. In recent years, an increasing number of pharmaceutical manufacturers has attempted to significantly limit the number of pharmacies that may dispense their drugs. Out of a total of approximately 60,000 traditional and specialty pharmacies, these manufacturers increasingly limit access to their drugs to anywhere from one to 20 specialty pharmacies, to ensure they can manage a drug's rollout, obtain real time data, and confirm the unique patient population's receipt of the necessary services and support to remain adherent. There are several limited-distribution drugs to which we do not have access. Access to limited-distribution drugs provides us with significant competitive advantages in developing relationships with payers and physicians. If we cannot obtain access to new limited-distribution pharmaceuticals or lose access to limited-distribution pharmaceuticals we currently distribute this could have a material and adverse impact on our business, profitability and results of operations.. We obtain access to limited-distribution drugs primarily from small to mid-size biotechnology companies, many of whom are bringing their first or second drug to market. We incur significant expense, time and opportunity cost to educate and assist emerging small and mid-size biotechnology manufacturers in bringing these products to the marketplace without any guarantee of a successful drug launch or future sales. The failure to monetize these relationships could adversely impact our profitability and our prospects.. We also provide a significant amount of direct and indirect services for the benefit of our pharmaceutical manufacturer customers and our patients to gain access to specialty drugs, and our failure to provide services at optimal quality could result in losing access to existing and future drugs. In addition, we incur significant costs in providing these services and receive minimal service fees in return. If pharmaceutical manufacturers require significant additional services and products to obtain access to their drugs without a corresponding increase in service fees paid to us, our profitability could be adversely impacted.. We have limited contractual protections with pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers that supply us with most of the pharmaceuticals that we distribute.. We dispense specialty pharmaceuticals that are supplied to us by a variety of manufacturers and wholesalers, many of which are our only source of that specific pharmaceutical. Our contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers often provide us with, among other things:.                   discounts on drugs we purchase to be dispensed from our specialty pharmacies;.                   rebates and service fees; and.                   access to limited-distribution specialty pharmaceuticals.. Our contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers are generally for three years and are terminable on reasonably short notice by either party before or after the contract term. In addition, our contracts with wholesalers provide for purchase money security interests in products sold. If several of these contractual relationships are terminated or materially altered by the pharmaceutical manufacturers or wholesalers or if we are otherwise unable to renew these contracts or enter into similar contracts on favorable terms, we could lose a major source of the pharmaceuticals we dispense.. 24. Table of Contents. We generate a significant amount of revenue from certain specialty drugs we dispense.. Our three largest revenue producing specialty drugs we dispense represented 34 percent, 29 percent and 30 percent of our revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our 10 largest revenue producing specialty drugs we dispense represented 51 percent, 51 percent and 55 percent of our revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. If the use of these specialty drugs were to decline due to clinical ineffectiveness or as a result of the introduction of more effective alternatives, and we are unable to obtain access to high growth alternative specialty drugs, our revenues would be adversely affected. Loss of revenues from our three largest revenue producing specialty drugs without access to alternative high growth specialty drugs could have a material adverse effect on our revenues in the short term.. Our revenues, profitability and cash flows may be negatively impacted if safety risks of a specialty drug are publicized or if a specialty drug is withdrawn from the market due to manufacturing or other issues.. Physicians may significantly reduce the numbers of prescriptions for a specialty drug with safety concerns or manufacturing issues. Additionally, negative press regarding a drug with a higher safety risk profile may result in reduced global consumer demand for such drug. Decreased utilization and demand of a specialty drug we distribute could materially and adversely impact our volumes, net revenues, profitability and cash flows.. Many healthcare companies have a presence in the specialty pharmacy market, and we expect a significant increase in competition due to high growth anticipated in specialty drug spending, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business.. There are a significant number of competitors that provide one or more comprehensive services, including distribution, with respect to specialty pharmacy drugs, some of whom have greater resources than we do, including: PBMs; retail pharmacy chains and independent retail pharmacies; health plans; national, regional and niche specialty pharmacies; home and specialty infusion therapy companies; physician practices and hospital systems; and group purchasing organizations.. The three leading specialty pharmacies, which operate as divisions within each of Express Scripts, CVS Caremark and Walgreens, have significantly greater market share, resources and purchasing power than we do. Express Scripts and CVS Caremark also benefit from their services as PBMs to several healthcare organizations, and CVS Caremark and Walgreens also benefit from their retail and urgent care locations. As we increase in scale and market share, or provide additional healthcare services (including PBM services), we expect more direct competition for certain drugs, payer and patient access, and services from these three companies. Many of our constituents are well informed and can easily move between us and our competitors. These factors together with the impact of the competitive marketplace or other significant differentiating factors between us and our competitors may make it difficult for us to retain existing business.. Further, several other traditional pharmacies with significant resources are attempting to build, acquire, or partner with specialty pharmacies due to the double-digit growth anticipated in spending on specialty prescription drugs compared to flat to low-single digit growth in spending on traditional prescription drugs. There are also many smaller specialty pharmacies and other entities in the healthcare industry that provide limited specialty pharmacy services; while such entities presently compete with us to a lesser extent, they may be able to invest significant resources, through acquisition or otherwise, to compete with us on a larger scale.. Moreover, many of the hospital pharmacies for which we provide patient management services may acquire a competing specialty pharmacy business or start their own specialty pharmacy business and thereby become competitors. In addition, many of our PBM customers have their own specialty pharmacy businesses, and to the extent certain of our products can be obtained internally, these customers could reduce or cease doing business with us. Our failure to maintain and expand relationships with payers and PBM companies, who can effectively determine the pharmacy source for their members, could materially and adversely affect our competitive position and prospects.. Any increase in competition noted above could significantly increase the competition for limited-distribution drugs, reduce gross profit, and otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.. 25. Table of Contents. Our ability to grow our specialty pharmacy business could be limited if we do not expand the number of drugs and treatments we offer or if we lose even a small percentage of our existing patients.. Our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and high cost medications that serve a relatively small patient population. Due to the limited patient populations utilizing the medications that our specialty pharmacy business handles, our future growth relies, in part, on expanding our base of drugs or penetration in certain treatment categories. Further, given our relatively high net sales and gross profit per prescription dispensed, a small percentage decrease in our patient base or reduction in demand for any reason for the medications we dispense could have a material adverse effect on our business.. Risks related to the PBM Industry. The PBM marketplace is very competitive, which could compress our margins and impair our ability to attract and retain clients. Our failure to effectively differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors could magnify the impact of the competitive environment.. Significant competition in the PBM marketplace generates greater client demand for lower pricing, increased revenue sharing and enhanced product and service offerings. These competitive factors apply pressure on operating margins and cause many PBMs to reduce the prices charged for core products and services while sharing with clients a greater portion of the rebates and related revenues received from pharmaceutical manufacturers.. In this regard, we maintain contractual relationships that provide for purchase discounts and/or rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network and by our specialty and mail order pharmacies (all or a portion of which may be passed on to clients). Rebates from manufacturers often depend on a PBM's ability to meet contractual market share, formulary or other requirements, including in some cases the placement of a manufacturer's products on the PBM's or client's formularies. If the discounts or rebates provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. In addition, we also maintain contractual relationships with participating pharmacies that provide for discounts on retail transactions for generic and brand name drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network. If we lose our relationship with one or more of the larger pharmacies in our network, or if the retail discounts provided by network pharmacies decline, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.. To succeed in the highly competitive PBM marketplace, we must differentiate our products and services by demonstrating enhanced value to our clients. Unless we can attract new clients and demonstrate enhanced value through innovative product and service offerings to retain and cross-sell additional products and services to our existing clients, we may be unable to remain competitive.. If we fail to identify and implement new ways to mitigate pricing pressures or maintain positive trends, this could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain clients or sell additional services, which could negatively impact our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. The possibility of client losses and/or the failure to win new business.. PBM businesses generate revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related healthcare services to plan members. PBM client contracts often have terms of approximately three years in duration. In some cases, however, PBM clients may negotiate a shorter or longer contract term or may require early or periodic renegotiation of pricing prior to expiration of a contract. Our PBM clients can easily move between our competitors and often seek competing bids prior to expiration of their contracts. In addition, the reputational impact of a service-related incident could negatively affect our business. These factors, either individually or in the aggregate, together with the impact of competitive pressures, could make it difficult for us to attract new clients, retain existing clients and cross-sell additional services, which could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results.. Furthermore, the PBM industry has been impacted by consolidation activity that may continue in the future. In the event one or more of our PBM clients is acquired by an entity that obtains PBM services from a competitor, we may be unable to retain all or a portion of our clients' business. Because of this, we continually face challenges in competing for new PBM business and retaining or renewing our existing PBM business.. 26. Table of Contents. There can be no assurance that we will be able to win new business or secure renewal business on terms as favorable to us as the present terms. The loss of business, or a material change in the terms, could adversely impact our business, profitability or financial results.. Entry into disadvantageous contracts for our claims processing or clinical services could negatively impact our business. We provide claims processing and clinical services to clients on either a fixed amount per transaction or percentage of expenditure basis. When contracting for these services, we may not be able to contract at rates that ensure such transactions will be profitable. In the event of errors in services provided, Diplomat may have exposure in excess of the value to Diplomat of the claim processed. Should we enter into a significant number of unprofitable contracts or experience sizeable errors in providing our services, this may have an adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations.. If significant changes occur within the pharmacy provider marketplace, or if other issues arise with respect to our pharmacy networks, including the loss of or adverse change in our relationship with one or more key pharmacy providers, our business and financial results could be impaired.. The entry of one or more large pharmacy chains into the PBM business in addition to the current pharmacy chain competitors, the consolidation of existing pharmacy chains or increased leverage or market share by the largest pharmacy providers, could increase the likelihood of negative changes in our relationship with such pharmacies. Changes in the overall composition of our pharmacy networks, or reduced pharmacy access under our networks, could have a negative impact on our claims volume and/or our competitiveness in the marketplace, which could cause us to fall short of certain guarantees in our contracts with clients or otherwise impair our business or results of operations.. Risks related to our Business. We may not be able to effectively execute our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate acquired businesses.. We have completed several significant acquisitions in recent years. The success of an acquisition, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate. It is possible that any integration process could result in any of the following risks which, individually or in aggregate, may have a material adverse effect on our business, affect our ability to achieve, or result in difficulties in realizing, the anticipated financial or strategic benefits and cost savings of an acquisition: the loss of key employees; higher than expected costs; diversion of management attention or capital from other uses; disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies; impairment of existing relationships with our employees, distributors, suppliers, customers, or other constituents or those of the acquired companies; difficulty in integrating acquired operations, including restructuring and realigning activities, personnel, technologies, information and data security and products; and assumption of known and unknown liabilities, some of which may be difficult or impossible to quantify. In addition, acquiring entities and the integration in to our operations may require significant capital expenditures, increased indebtedness and non-cash impairment charges relating to acquired assets. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. These integration matters could have an adverse effect during any transition period and on the combined company for an undetermined period after completion of an acquisition.. We will continue to review strategic acquisition opportunities that will enhance our market position, expand our services, expertise and drug access, add value to our constituents, and/or provide sufficient synergies. Strategic transactions, including the pursuit of such transactions, often require significant up-front costs and require significant resources and management attention. These significant up-front costs relate to the assessment, due diligence, negotiation and execution of the transaction. We may also incur additional costs to retain key employees as well as transaction fees and costs related to executing our integration plans.. Sales of shares of our common stock after the expiration of the LDI acquisition lock-up period may cause the market price of our common stock to fall.. In connection with the acquisition of LDI, we issued 4,113,188 shares of our common stock upon the closing of the transaction. We are required to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the benefit of the sellers with respect to the resale of such common stock. The sellers entered into a subscription agreement which restricts them from selling or otherwise transferring (subject to limited exceptions) our common stock acquired. 27. Table of Contents. pursuant to the LDI acquisition as follows: no sales or transfers prior to March 20, 2018; sales or transfers of up to 50 percent of such holder's common stock between March 20, 2018 and June 20, 2018; and no restrictions after June 20, 2018. A significant number of shares of our common stock may be sold following the end of the foregoing restrictions.. Such sales of our common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for our common stock. The market price of our common stock could decline significantly as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market. These sales, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.. Our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance.. Our quarterly and annual operating results, and in particular our revenues, have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future. These fluctuations make it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. Our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control and are difficult to predict, including the following:.                   the launch timing for specialty drugs;.                   the effect of the expiration of drug patents and the introduction of generic drugs;.                   the demand for the specialty drugs to which we have access;.                   whether our expected distribution share of drugs that come to market is properly estimated;.                   whether revenues and margins on sales of drugs that come to market are properly estimated;.                   expenditures that we will or may incur to acquire or develop additional capabilities;.                   the timing of increases in drug costs by manufacturers;.                   the amount of DIR fees and the timing for assessing us for such fees; and.                   changes in the reimbursement policies of payers.. These factors, individually or in the aggregate, could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Investors should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period.. We have significant outstanding debt following the acquisition of LDI, which could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our interest expense. Our debt service obligations will reduce the funds available for other business purposes, and the terms and covenants relating to our current and future indebtedness could adversely impact our financial performance and liquidity. Failure to meet our debt service obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We had outstanding indebtedness of $738.3 million under our credit facility at December 31, 2017. As of such date, we could incur up to an additional $61.7 million in indebtedness under our credit facility and we may be permitted to incur additional indebtedness under specified conditions. We have substantially increased the amount of our outstanding indebtedness compared to our recent historical indebtedness amounts, which could have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing our interest expense.. Our increased debt service obligations may require us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on our debt, which would reduce the funds available for other business. 28. Table of Contents. purposes, and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. Our ability to meet our cash requirements, including our debt service obligations, is dependent upon our ability to maintain our operating performance, which will be subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our cash requirements and debt service obligations. Our failure to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay our debts could have a material adverse effect on us.. If our operating results, cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates rise significantly, we could face liquidity constraints. If we are unable to service our debt or experience a significant reduction in our liquidity, we could be forced to reduce or delay planned capital expenditures and other initiatives (including acquisitions), sell assets, restructure or refinance our debt or seek additional equity capital, and such transactions may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. We may in the future need to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements. This may make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business. Our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Furthermore, any of these actions may not be sufficient to allow us to service our debt obligations or may have an adverse impact on our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing and failure to obtain such additional financing or refinancing could have a material adverse impact on our operations.. In addition, we will have additional exposure to interest rate risk because our debt obligations are at variable interest rates. We currently do not maintain hedging contracts that would limit our exposure to variable rates of interest. However, in the future we may use derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, to fix the effective rate paid on all or a portion of our debt obligations. The use of derivatives, including interest rate swaps, is a highly specialized activity that involves certain risks, including counterparty risk. If a counterparty defaults, we would not be able to use the anticipated net receipts under the derivative contract to offset our interest payments. In addition, the impact of the use of derivatives will fluctuate dependent upon movements in market interest rates.. We may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future. If we incur more debt in the future and do not retire existing debt, the risks described above could increase.. Our existing debt agreements limit our ability to take certain actions, which may impact our ability to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or access the credit markets when needed.. Our credit facility contains covenants requiring us to, among other things, provide financial and other information reporting, and provide notice upon certain events. These covenants also place restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions, redeem or repurchase capital stock, make investments and loans, and enter into certain transactions, including selling assets, engaging in mergers or acquisitions, or engaging in transactions with affiliates. If we fail to satisfy one or more of the covenants under our credit facility, we would be in default thereunder, and may be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources or otherwise not be able to draw down against our line of credit. Under such circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to refinance existing indebtedness or otherwise access the credit markets for any reason, whether due to market conditions or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and your investment in our common stock.. Consolidation in the healthcare industry could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Many healthcare industry participants are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with significant market power and we expect such trend to continue. As provider networks and managed care organizations consolidate, thereby decreasing the number of market participants, competition to provide products and services like ours will become more intense, and the importance of establishing relationships with key industry participants will become greater. In addition, industry participants may try to use their increased market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve, potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among the industry participants with whom we engage. If we are forced to reduce prices as a result of either an imbalance of market power or decreased demand for our products, revenue would be reduced, and we could become significantly less profitable.. 29. Table of Contents. Our future success depends upon our ability to maintain and manage our continued growth. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may incur unexpected expenses and be unable to meet the demands of our customers and other constituents.. Over the past several years our business has grown significantly, and we aim to continue to expand the scope of our operations, both organically and through strategic acquisitions. Growth in our operations will place significant demands on our management, financial and other resources. We cannot be certain that our current systems, procedures, controls and space will adequately support expansion of our operations, and we may be unable to expand or upgrade our systems or infrastructure to accommodate future growth. Our future operating results will depend on the ability of our management and key employees to successfully maintain our independence and corporate culture, preserve the effectiveness of our high-touch patient care model, manage changing business conditions, and implement and improve our technical, administrative, financial control and reporting systems. Our inability to finance future growth, manage future expansion, or hire and retain the personnel needed to manage our business successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.. We receive a significant amount of prescription drugs from one wholesaler and two manufacturers. The loss of any of these relationships could disrupt our business and adversely impact our revenues for one or more fiscal quarters.. Specialty drug purchases from AmerisourceBergen, a drug wholesaler, Celgene and Pharmacyclics, pharmaceutical manufacturers, represented 41 percent, 17 percent and 14 percent, respectively, of cost of products sold in 2017, 49 percent, 13 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of cost of products sold in 2016 and 50 percent, 12 percent and 9 percent, respectively, of cost of products sold in 2015. Our amended contract with AmerisourceBergen expires September 30, 2018, and can be terminated by, among other things, either party's material breach that continues for 30 days. The agreement provides for negotiated discounts that differ by drug classification, and any permitted reclassification of products by AmerisourceBergen to a lower discount category could have an adverse impact on our gross profit. In addition, the amended contract also commits us to a minimum purchase obligation per contract year of approximately $2.0 billion to maintain these current negotiated discounts. Failure to meet this minimum purchase obligation would result in significant additional expense without corresponding revenues.  Furthermore, AmerisourceBergen has a long-term relationship with one of the largest specialty pharmacy companies in the country, which could adversely impact our relationship with AmerisourceBergen. Our significant competitors may obtain better discounts from AmerisourceBergen or other wholesalers, which could impair our competitiveness.. Our amended agreement with Celgene expires June 30, 2019, and can be terminated by either party without cause upon 90 days prior written notice, or earlier in the event of a material breach. Unlike the specialty drugs we purchase from AmerisourceBergen, the specialty drugs we purchase from Celgene are not available from any other source.. Our agreement with Pharmacyclics automatically renews annually, and can be terminated by either party without cause upon 90 days prior written notice, or earlier in the event of a material breach. Unlike the specialty drugs we purchase from AmerisourceBergen, the specialty drugs we purchase from Pharmacyclics are not available from any other source.. The loss of any of these relationships, the failure by the suppliers to fulfill our purchase orders on a timely basis or at all, or a contractual dispute could significantly disrupt our business and adversely impact our revenues for one or more fiscal quarters. In the event of a contractual dispute, we could become involved in litigation, the outcome of which may be uncertain or difficult to predict and could result in our incurrence of substantial costs regardless of the outcome. These agreements also limit our ability to distribute competing drugs, while allowing the supplier to distribute through other channels.. Security breaches or other failures or disruptions of our information technology systems, our information security systems and our infrastructure to support our business and to protect the privacy and security of sensitive customer and business information could materially adversely affect our business.. Many aspects of our operations are dependent on our communications and information systems and the information collected, processed, stored and handled by these systems. Throughout our operations, we receive, retain and transmit certain highly confidential information, including personal health information, personally identifiable information and other data that our customers and other constituents provide to purchase products or services, enroll in programs or services, register on our websites, interact with our personnel, or otherwise communicate with us. In addition, for these operations, we depend, in part, on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. Although we have not historically experienced a. 30. Table of Contents. major systems failure or security breach, our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses and security breaches including credit card information breaches, vandalism, catastrophic events and human error. Like most companies that conduct business in part over the internet, we rely on the availability and connectivity of the internet, which is out of our control.. A compromise of our information security controls or those of the businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged, or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from patients, physicians and other persons, any of which could adversely affect our business, brands, financial position and results of operations. Moreover, a data security breach could require that we expend significant resources related to our information systems and infrastructure, subject us to investigations by various state or federal authorities, and distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties. Additionally, while certain data security breaches might not result in a material adverse effect on our business operations, breaches involving the exfiltration or unauthorized access to personally identifiable information of patients or other individuals can significantly impact such individuals, resulting in a loss of confidence in, or goodwill of, the Company. If our information systems are damaged, fail to work properly, or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to remediate, repair, or replace them, and we may experience a loss of critical information, customer disruptions, and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform essential functions and implement new and innovative services. In addition, compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in considerable expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. See also \"Risks Related to Federal and State Laws and Regulations  -  Our business operations involve the substantial receipt and use of confidential health information concerning individuals. A failure to adequately protect such information may harm our reputation and subject us to significant liabilities, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\". Our failure to maintain significant relationships or build new relationships with clinical experts and key thought leaders at U.S. physician groups and universities could result in a loss of existing patients, future referrals on existing and future drugs and pharmaceutical industry data, and could materially adversely impact our business and prospects.. We have developed significant relationships with clinical experts and key opinion leaders at physician groups and universities throughout the U.S. who are focused on oncology, immunology, specialty infusion therapy, hepatitis and multiple sclerosis, involved in significant research projects related to specialty drugs, and who are high-volume prescribers of specialty drugs. Our failure to provide quality and timely services to such persons and their patients could impair our relationship, which could result in a loss of existing patients, future referrals on existing and future drugs and pharmaceutical industry data (including the anticipated drug pipeline), and therefore materially adversely impact our business and prospects.. The success of our hub services depends on the willingness of participants in the specialty pharmacy system to continue outsourcing work and on our reputation for independent, high-quality service.. Our success in providing hub services depends on the ability and willingness of participants in the specialty pharmacy system to outsource the services we provide. Accordingly, a general downturn in the specialty pharmacy industry, or healthcare industry more generally, could materially harm our hub services offerings. In addition, demand for our hub services may be affected by our customers' perceptions regarding outsourcing as a whole. For example, other hub services companies could engage in conduct or fail to detect malfeasance that could render our customers less willing to do business with us or any hub services company. If any such event causing industry-wide reputational harm were to occur, even though outside our control, confidence in the industry generally could be impaired and the willingness of our customers to outsource services to organizations that provide hub services like ours could diminish.. Moreover, demand for our hub services depends to a significant extent on the trust our customers place in us and our reputation for independent, high-quality service. To maintain client satisfaction and compliance, we keep certain information and software systems, infrastructure, and employees \"firewalled\" from our specialty pharmacy and pharmacy benefit management activities. In the event that our protocols or procedures are not followed, or contain undetected errors or defects that are subsequently discovered by us, our customers or a third party, our reputation with current and potential customers could be harmed. If one or more of the foregoing events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. 31. Table of Contents. Significant disruptions to infrastructure or any of our facilities due to failure of technology or some other catastrophic event could adversely impact our business.. Our distribution centers, call centers, data centers and corporate facilities depend on the local infrastructure and the uninterrupted operation of our computerized dispensing systems and our electronic data processing systems. Significant disruptions at any of these facilities or due to failure of technology or any other failure or disruption to these systems or to the infrastructure due to natural disasters, severe weather conditions, fire, electrical outage, acts of terrorism or malice, war, health epidemics or pandemics, global political and economic developments, or some other catastrophic event or the prospect of these events, could, temporarily or indefinitely, significantly reduce, or partially or totally eliminate, our ability to process and dispense prescriptions and provide products and services to our clients and members.. Many of the prescriptions we distribute are distributed from a single facility or stored at a single storage site. Loss or damage to a distribution facility or storage site due to a natural disaster or other catastrophic event could cause interruptions or delays in our business and loss of inventory and adversely affect our ability to deliver products to meet patient demands or contractual requirements, which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences. Because of the time required to approve and license a distribution facility a third-party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace distribution capabilities in the event we lose distribution capabilities due to natural disaster, regulatory action or otherwise. Such natural disasters or catastrophic events could materially and adversely affect the U.S. economy in general and the healthcare industry specifically. For example, in the event of a natural disaster, bioterrorism attack, pandemic or other extreme events, we could face, among other things, significant medical costs and increased use of healthcare services. Any such disaster or similar event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.. Our disaster recovery plan is currently limited and has yet to be tested by a real-world catastrophic event. As a result, we do not know how our disaster recovery plan will function, if at all, should such an event occur. In addition, we have made significant acquisitions in recent years that remain to be integrated, and may not be able to fully implement our disaster recovery plan, or at all, in the event of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event. Even though we believe we carry commercially reasonable business interruption and liability insurance, that protects us in certain events for a limited period of time, we might suffer losses because of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our insurance policies or for which we do not have coverage and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur. If a significant portion of our facilities was destroyed or our operations were interrupted for any extended period, our business, financial condition, and operating results would be harmed.. A disruption in our operations could hurt our relations with our constituents and significantly impact our results of operations.. Our business is dependent on a number of different operations, products and processes, many of which involve third parties. A disruption in our business operations could result from, among other things, contamination of drugs or a failure to maintain appropriate shipment and storage conditions, including maintenance of our coolers for products that require refrigeration, an error in order processing, the unavailability of services provided by our suppliers, vendors or shipping carriers, labor strikes, or unanticipated disruptions at our dispensing facilities, call centers, data centers, or corporate facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. We are highly dependent on our senior management and key employees. Competition for our employees is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees that we need to support our business and our anticipated future growth or effectively plan for succession.. Our success largely depends on the skills, experience and continued efforts of our management. We have recently appointed new key executives, including our interim chief executive officer, president and chief financial officer, and we may expect to hire or promote additional key management team members. Furthermore, we intend to grow the business significantly, which will depend on our ability to continue to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified individuals in key management, pharmacist, nursing and similar roles. Competition for senior management and other key personnel is intense, and the pool of suitable candidates is limited. In addition, the realization of the expected benefits from our recent, and potentially future, acquisitions will depend to some extent on our ability to retain key employees from the entities we have acquired or may acquire in the future. If we fail to provide sufficient incentives to motivate and retain our key executives, our business and prospects may suffer. If we lose the services of one or. 32. Table of Contents. more of our key employees, we may not be able to find a suitable replacement and our business could be materially adversely affected.. In January 2018, we appointed an interim chief executive officer, Jeff Park, replacing our co-founder, chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors, Philip Hagerman, who had led our company throughout its history of more than 40 years. Our ability to implement effective succession planning is a key factor for our long-term success. Failure to effectively transfer knowledge and facilitate smooth transitions for key employees could adversely affect our long-term strategic planning and execution, and the morale and productivity of the workforce could be disrupted, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.. We rely heavily on a single shipping provider, and our business could be harmed if our shipping rates increase, our provider is unavailable, or our provider performs poorly and we are unable to successfully replace our shipping provider.. A substantial majority of the specialty drugs we dispense are shipped through UPS. We depend heavily on these shipping services for efficient and cost-effective delivery of our products.. The risks associated with our dependence on UPS include:.                   any significant increase in shipping rates, including rate increases resulting from higher fuel prices;.                   strikes or other service interruptions by UPS or by another carrier that could affect UPS;.                   spoilage of high cost drugs during shipment, since our drugs often require special handling, such as refrigeration; and.                   increased delivery errors by UPS, resulting in lost or stolen product.. In the event any of the foregoing occurs and we are unable to transition efficiently and effectively to a new provider, we could incur increased costs or experience a material disruption in our operations.. The specialty pharmacy and PBM industries are highly litigious and future litigation or other proceedings could subject us to significant monetary damages or penalties or require us to change our business practices, which could impair our reputation and result in a material adverse effect on our business.. We are subject to risks relating to litigation, enforcement actions, regulatory proceedings, government inquiries and investigations, and other similar actions in connection with our business operations, including the dispensing of pharmaceutical products by our specialty and home delivery pharmacies, claims and complaints related to the various regulations to which we are subject, services rendered in connection with our disease management activity and our pharmacy benefits management services. While we are currently not subject to any material litigation of this nature, such litigation is not unusual in our industry. Further, while certain costs are covered by insurance, we may incur uninsured costs related to the defense of such proceedings that could be material to our financial performance. In addition, as a public company, any material decline in the market price of our common stock may expose us to purported class action lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend or indemnify (to the extent not covered by insurance) and a distraction to management. See Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\" for information regarding a purported class action against the Company and certain current and former executive officers and a shareholder derivative suit. If one or more of these proceedings or any future proceeding has an unfavorable outcome, we cannot provide any assurance it would not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including our ability to attract and retain clients as a result of any negative reputational impact of such an outcome.. Furthermore, unexpected volatility in insurance premiums or retention requirements or claims in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. 33. Table of Contents. We are self-insured for medical benefits, creating. significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims, which may lead to volatility in our expenditures and could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. The Company has recently implemented a self-insured medical plan. Because we are self-insured for a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses, our insurance and claims expense may be volatile. Although we have established liabilities based on our claims expectations, we have minimal experience establishing such liabilities. As a result, actual claims, costs and expenses may exceed our estimates. If the frequency and/or severity of claims increase, our expenditures could increase and the results of operations could be adversely affected. The timing of the incurrence of these costs could significantly and adversely impact our operating results. Significant increases in healthcare costs related to medical inflation, claims experience, current and future federal and state laws and regulations, and other cost components that are beyond our control could significantly increase the costs of our self-insured medical plan or require us to adjust the level of benefits offered to our employees. In the future, changes to healthcare eligibility, design, and cost structure may significantly increase our healthcare coverage costs, which could have an adverse impact on our business and operating costs, and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. Our business could be harmed if the supply of any of the specialty drugs we distribute becomes scarce or is disrupted.. Many specialty drugs are manufactured with ingredients that are susceptible to supply shortages. In particular, specialty drugs used to treat disease states such as hemophilia and autoimmune conditions can depend on supplies of donated blood, which may fluctuate. A supply shortage, or in rare cases, a complete cessation of manufacturing, of a specialty drug we distribute could materially and adversely impact our volumes, net revenues, profitability and cash flows.. Our business would be harmed if the pharmaceutical industry reduces research, development and marketing of specialty drugs that are compatible with the services we provide.. Our business is highly dependent on continued research, development and marketing expenditures of pharmaceutical companies, and the ability of those companies to develop, supply and generate demand for specialty drugs that are compatible with the services we provide. Our business could be materially adversely affected if manufacturers fail to market and support existing drugs, research potential new treatments, or develop new drugs. Our business could also be harmed by any governmental or private initiative that would alter how drug manufacturers promote or sell products and services.. We support hospitals that participate in the 340B Drug Pricing Program (\"340B Program\"). In recent years, the 340B Program has faced increased scrutiny from Congress, federal agencies and pharmaceutical manufacturers. In light of the publication or proposed regulatory guidance and future changes to the 340B Program, the revenues we derive from hospital services could be adversely impacted.. Our hospital program supports hospitals that are 340B covered entities pursuant to which such hospitals are able to purchase certain specialty drugs from pharmaceutical manufacturers at a discount for dispensing to eligible patients. In cases where the covered entity treats an insured patient with a discounted specialty drug, the federal government or the patient's private insurance routinely reimburses the entity for the full price of the medication, and the entity is able to retain the difference between the reduced price it pays for the drug and the full amount for which it is reimbursed. In recent years, this practice and other aspects of the 340B Program have come under increased scrutiny. In August 2015, HHS published proposed 340B program guidance (the \"Proposed Guidance\"). The Proposed Guidance relates to program eligibility and registration, eligibility of drugs for purchase under 340B, patient eligibility to receive 340B drugs, requirements for covered entities, arrangements for contract pharmacies, manufacturer responsibilities, rebate options for HIV drug assistance programs and program integrity. To address regulatory concerns with the risk of double discounting in the contract pharmacy setting, the Proposed Guidance provides that contract pharmacies will not dispense 340B drugs to certain Medicaid patients without a written agreement that describes a system to prevent duplicate discounts. In addition, the Proposed Guidance provides that (1) each covered entity is expected to conduct quarterly reviews and annual independent audits of each contract pharmacy location, and (2) any 340B Program violation detected through quarterly reviews or annual audits of a contract pharmacy should be disclosed to HHS.. Although we are not direct participants in the 340B Program and related services accounted for less than 0.1 percent of our revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our involvement with hospitals that. 34. Table of Contents. are covered entities could cause reputational harm as a result of increased controversy regarding the 340B Program. In addition, if hospitals decrease their utilization of the 340B Program, whether due to regulatory changes or increased scrutiny, such decrease would impact revenue from this business.. We may be unable to obtain or retain the right to use or successfully integrate third-party licenses in our technology-based products, which could limit the number and type of products we are able to offer our customers.. We rely on third-party licenses for some of the technology used in our products, and intend to continue licensing technologies from third parties. Most of these licenses can be renewed only by mutual consent and may be terminated if we breach the terms of the license and fail to cure the breach within a specified period of time. We may not be able to continue to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain or renew these licenses or find suitable alternatives could delay development of new products or prevent us from selling our existing products until suitable substitute technology can be identified, licensed, integrated, or developed by us. We cannot assure you as to when we would be able to do so, if at all.. Most of our third-party licenses are non-exclusive. Our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the technology covered by these licenses and use the technology to attempt to compete more effectively with us. In addition, our use of third-party technologies exposes us to risks associated with the integration of components from various sources into our products, such as unknown software errors or defects or unanticipated incompatibility with our systems and technologies, or unintended infringement resulting from the combination of intellectual property rights. Further, we are dependent on our vendors' continued support of the technology we use. If a vendor chooses to discontinue or is unable to support a licensed technology, we may not be able to modify or adapt our products to fit other available technologies in a timely manner, if at all.. We outsource certain operations of our business to third-party vendors, which could leave us vulnerable to data security failures of third parties.. From time to time, like many similarly situated companies, we outsource certain operations to third-party vendors to achieve efficiencies. Such outsourced functions include payment processing, data center hosting and management, facilities management, etc. Although we expect our business partners to maintain the same vigilance as we do with respect to data security, we cannot control the operations of these third parties. While we engage in certain actions to reduce the exposure resulting from outsourcing, vulnerabilities in the information security infrastructure of our business partners could make us vulnerable to attacks or disruptions in service.. Possible changes in industry pricing benchmarks.. It is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price (\"AWP\"), which is the pricing reference used for many pharmaceutical purchase agreements, retail network contracts, specialty payer agreements and other contracts with third party payers in connection with the reimbursement of specialty drug payments. Future changes to the use of AWP or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing, including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health programs and/or other payers, could impact our pricing arrangements. The effect of these possible changes on our business cannot be predicted at this time.. Risks Related to Federal and State Laws and Regulations. We operate in a highly regulated industry and must comply with a significant number of complex and evolving requirements. Changes in state and federal government regulations could restrict our ability to conduct our business and cause us to incur significant costs.. The marketing, sale and purchase of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and provision of healthcare services generally are extensively regulated by federal and state governments. In addition, other aspects of our business are also subject to government regulation. The applicable regulatory framework is complex, and the laws are very broad in scope. Many of these laws remain open to interpretation and have not been addressed by substantive court decisions. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our interpretation would prevail or that one or more government agencies will not interpret the applicable laws and regulations differently. Changes in the law or new interpretations of existing law can have a dramatic effect on our operations, our cost of doing business and the amount of reimbursement we receive from governmental third-party payers such as Medicare and Medicaid. If we fail to comply with the laws and regulations directly applicable to our business, we could suffer civil and/or criminal penalties, and we could be excluded from participating in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs, which could have an adverse impact on our business.. 35. Table of Contents. Some of the healthcare laws and regulations that apply to our activities include:.                   The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully paying, offering, receiving or soliciting money or anything else of value in order to induce the referral of patients, or to induce a person to purchase, lease, order, arrange for, or recommend services or goods covered in whole or in part by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is an intent-based statute and the failure of a business arrangement to satisfy all elements of a safe harbor will not necessarily render the arrangement illegal, but it may subject that arrangement to increased scrutiny by enforcement authorities. Any violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute can lead to significant penalties, including criminal penalties, civil fines and exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid..                   The Stark Law prohibits physicians from ordering Designated Health Services for Medicare and Medicaid patients from any entity with which the physicians or their immediate family members have a \"financial relationship\" (i.e., an ownership, investment, or compensation relationship), and prohibits the entity from presenting or causing to be presented claims to Medicare or Medicaid for those referred services, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law is a broad prohibition on certain business relationships, with detailed exceptions. However, unlike the Anti-Kickback Statute under which an activity may fall outside a safe harbor and still be lawful, a referral for Designated Health Services that does not fall within an exception is strictly prohibited by the Stark Law. A violation of the Stark Law is punishable by civil sanctions, including significant fines and exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid..                   Legislation regulating PBM activities in a comprehensive manner has been and continues to be considered in a number of states. In the past, certain organizations, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\"), an organization of state insurance regulators, have considered proposals to regulate PBMs and/or certain PBM activities, such as formulary development and utilization management. While the actions of the NAIC would not have the force of law, it may influence states to adopt model legislation that such organizations promulgate. Certain states have adopted PBM registration and/or disclosure laws that require complying with applicable disclosure requirements mandating disclosure of various aspects of financial practices, including those concerning pharmaceutical company revenue, as well as prescribing processes for prescription switching programs and client and provider audit terms. As more states consider similar legislation, it will be difficult to manage the distinct requirements of each..                   Changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions, purchase discount and rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers, or other PBM services could also reduce the discounts or rebates we receive. Additionally, changes in, or the adoption of, new laws or regulations relating to claims processing and billing, including our ability to collect network administration, technology and transmission fees, could adversely impact our profitability..                   HIPAA and HITECH provide federal privacy protections for individually identifiable health information. See \"Our business operations involve the substantial receipt and use of confidential health information concerning individuals. A failure to adequately protect any of this information could result in severe harm to our reputation and subject us to significant liabilities, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\" below..                   Pharmacies and pharmacists must obtain state licenses to operate and dispense pharmaceuticals. If we are unable to maintain our licenses or if states place burdensome restrictions or limitations on non-resident pharmacies, this could limit or affect our ability to operate in some states..                   Pharmacy benefits managers must obtain state licenses and comply with various insurance regulations to operate. If we are unable to maintain our licenses or if states place burdensome regulations on pharmacy benefits managers, this could limit or affect our ability to operate in some states..                   ERISA and related regulations regulate many aspects of a pharmacy benefit mangers contractual relationships with their clients. The failure of our PBMs to comply with ERISA requirements could result in fines and loss. 36. Table of Contents. of reputation. In addition, some states attempt to enact laws which impose fiduciary status on PBMs under certain circumstances which could have a negative effect on the PBMs margins..                   Many states impose \"any willing provider\", \"MAC\" and \"due process\" laws on pharmacy benefit managers which can affect a PBM's ability to manage certain aspects of the PBMs pharmacy network, including reimbursement to pharmacies..                   Pharmacy benefits managers that participate in the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program are subject to increasing federal regulations, including certain pricing restrictions and additional compliance requirements. Such participation can result in increased costs to the PBM as well as increased risk of running afoul of the related regulations..                   Federal and state investigations and enforcement actions continue to focus on the healthcare industry, scrutinizing a wide range of items such as joint venture arrangements, referral and billing practices, product discount arrangements, home healthcare services, dissemination of confidential patient information, clinical drug research trials and gifts for patients..                   Various governmental agencies have conducted investigations and audits in to PBM business practices, and many of these investigations and audits have resulted in those PBMs agreeing to civil penalties, including the payment of money and corporate integrity agreements. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such governmental investigations and audits may ultimately have on us or on the PBM industry in general. We may experience additional government scrutiny and audit activity which may result in the payment or offset of prior reimbursement from the government.. We are subject to the provisions of Medicare and Medicaid and we may be subject to civil penalties for knowingly making or causing to be made false claims or false records or statements to obtain reimbursement or for failure to return overpayments.. The federal False Claims Act (the \"False Claims Act\") imposes civil penalties for knowingly making or causing to be made false claims or false records or statements with respect to governmental programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, to obtain reimbursement or for failure to return overpayments. If we are subject to a civil penalty in regard to our Medicare and Medicaid billing or reimbursement practices, this could result in the possibility of substantial financial liabilities, which may adversely impact our results of operations. Furthermore, criminal statutes similar to the False Claims Act provide that if a corporation is convicted of presenting a claim or making a statement it knows to be false, fictitious or fraudulent to any federal agency, the corporation may be fined. Conviction under these statutes may also result in exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs. Many states have also enacted laws similar to the False Claims Act, some of which may include criminal penalties, substantial fines and treble damages, all of which could negatively impact our business and results of operations.. Regulatory changes relating to Medicare Part D and our failure to comply with CMS regulatory requirements could adversely impact our business and our results of operations.. The administration of Medicare Part D is complex and any failure to effectively execute the provisions of Medicare Part D may have an adverse effect on our business and our results of operations. In addition, there are many uncertainties about the financial and regulatory risks of participating in Medicare Part D, and we can give no assurance these risks will not materially adversely impact our business and results of operations.. The receipt of federal funds made available through Medicare Part D by our affiliates, our clients or us is subject to compliance with, among other things, the Medicare regulations and established laws and regulations governing the federal government's payment for healthcare goods and services, including the anti-kickback laws and the federal False Claims Act. If we do not comply with material contractual or regulatory obligations, including, for example, during CMS audits or client audits in cases where we provide PBM services to Medicare Part D sponsors, recoupment, monetary penalties and/or applicable sanctions, including suspension of enrollment and marketing or debarment from participation in Medicare programs, could be imposed.. Furthermore, the adoption or promulgation of new or more complex regulatory requirements or changes in the interpretation of existing regulatory requirements, in each case, associated with Medicare may require us to incur. 37. Table of Contents. significant compliance-related costs, including requiring substantial investments in the personnel and technology necessary to administer our Medicare Part D operations, which could adversely impact our business and our results of operations.. Legislative or regulatory policies in the U.S. designed to manage healthcare costs or alter healthcare financing practices or changes to government policies in general may adversely impact our business and results of operations.. From time to time, legislative and/or regulatory proposals are made in the U.S. that seek to manage the cost of healthcare, including prescription drug cost. Such proposals include changes in reimbursement rates, restrictions on rebates and discounts, restrictions on access or therapeutic substitution, limits on more efficient delivery channels, taxes on goods and services, price controls on prescription drugs and other significant healthcare reform proposals, including their repeal or replacement. Further, more exacting regulatory policies and requirements may cause a rise in costs, labor and time to meet all such requirements. We are unable to predict whether any such policies or proposals will be enacted, or the specific terms thereof. Certain of these policies or proposals, if enacted, could have a material adverse impact on our business.. Our business operations involve the substantial receipt and use of confidential health information concerning individuals. A failure to adequately protect any of this information could result in severe harm to our reputation and subject us to significant liabilities, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.. Most of our activities involve the receipt or use of PHI concerning individuals. We also use aggregated and de-identified data for research and analysis purposes, and in some cases, provide access to such de-identified data to pharmaceutical manufacturers, payers, and third-party data aggregators and analysts. We believe our de-identified data is proprietary and we expect our future operations will include additional services regarding the de-identified data we accumulate to take greater advantage of our relationships with data-driven pharmaceutical manufacturers.. There is substantial regulation at the federal and state levels addressing the use, disclosure and security of patient identifiable health information. At the federal level, HIPAA and the regulations issued thereunder impose extensive requirements governing the transmission, use and disclosure of health information by all participants in healthcare delivery, including physicians, hospitals, insurers and other payers. Many of these obligations were expanded under HITECH, passed as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Failure to comply with standards issued pursuant to federal or state statutes or regulations may result in criminal penalties and civil sanctions. In addition to regulating privacy of individual health information, HIPAA includes several anti-fraud and abuse laws, extends criminal penalties to private healthcare benefit programs and, in addition to Medicare and Medicaid, to other federal healthcare programs, and expands the Office of Inspector General's authority to exclude persons and entities from participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Further, future regulations and legislation that severely restrict or prohibit our use of patient identifiable or other information could limit our ability to use information critical to the operation of our business. If we violate a patient's privacy or are found to have violated any federal or state statute or regulation with regard to confidentiality or dissemination or use of PHI, we could be liable for significant damages, fines, or penalties and suffer severe reputational harm, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects. These risks may become more prominent as we provide additional services related to our de-identified data.. Our business operations involve communication with patients, for which certain federal and state laws exist. Violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions.. Certain federal and state laws, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, give the Federal Trade Communication, Federal Communications Commission, and state attorneys general the ability to regulate, and bring enforcement actions relating to, telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts such as phone calls, texts, or emails. Under certain circumstances, these laws may provide consumers with a private right of action. Violations of these laws could result in substantial statutory penalties and other sanctions.. Our business, financial position and operations could be adversely affected by environmental regulations, and health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our business.. Certain federal, state and local environmental regulations and health and safety laws and regulations are applicable to our business, including the management of hazardous substances, storage and transportation of possible hazardous materials, and various other disclosure and procedure requirements that may be promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or the Environmental Protection Agency that may apply to our operations.. 38. Table of Contents. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in substantial statutory penalties, sanctions, and, in certain circumstances, a private right of action by consumers, employees, or the general public.. There remains considerable uncertainty as to the full impact of the Health Reform Laws on our business.. Many of the structural changes enacted by the Health Reform Laws were implemented in 2014; however, much of the applicable regulations and sub-regulatory guidance are subject to being repealed or replaced. There is considerable uncertainty as to the impact of Health Reform Laws (and their potential repeal or replacement) on our business.. With respect to our PBM business the Health Reform Laws impose certain transparency requirements related to the healthcare insurance exchanges and healthcare coverage for Americans in general. The Health Reform Laws impact our business in a variety of ways and long-term impacts remain unclear with respect to the implementation of certain components of the Health Reform Laws and related regulatory guidance. Known impacts include an increase in utilization of the pharmacy benefit by a newly enrolled population with an unknown risk profile, compliance obligations stemming from increased state and federal government involvement in the healthcare marketplace, shifting claims liability from plan sponsors to third-party administrators for certain women's preventive benefits, data reporting obligations to support health plan issuers and insurers operating in the healthcare exchanges and general market reforms prohibiting the use of many factors traditionally used to establish premiums and adjustments implemented by health plan sponsors and health insurance providers.. Tax matters, including the changes in corporate tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition.. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) (the \"Tax Act\") was signed into law by President Trump. The Tax Act contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30 percent of earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80 percent of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. For existing deferred tax balances for which we were able to determine an impact and those which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate, we recognized an income tax benefit of $7.8 million, which is included as a component of income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017. We re-measured these deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. As we have not yet completed our accounting for the effect of the changes in the Tax Act, such completion could result in a material impact on our income tax expense and deferred tax balances during 2018.. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to our taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. There can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.. We also need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax laws and regulations. Changes in the application or interpretation of the Tax Act may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations.. 39. Table of Contents. Risks Related to Governance Matters. Certain provisions of our corporate governance documents and Michigan law could discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our Company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. These include provisions that, among other things:.                   permit the Board to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may determine (including the right to approve an acquisition or other change in control);.                   provide that the authorized number of directors may be fixed only by the Board in accordance with our amended and restated bylaws;.                   do not provide for cumulative voting rights (therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election);.                   divide our Board into three staggered classes;.                   provide that all vacancies and newly created directorships may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;.                   prohibit removal of directors without cause;.                   limit shareholders from calling special meetings of shareholders;.                   requires unanimous consent for shareholders to take action by written consent without approval of the action by our Board;.                   provide that shareholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of shareholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of shareholders must provide advance notice in writing and also comply with specified requirements related to the form and content of a shareholder's notice;.                   require at least 80 percent supermajority shareholder approval to alter, amend, or repeal certain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation; and.                   require at least 80 percent supermajority shareholder approval in order for shareholders to adopt, amend, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws.. These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of the Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing members of our management. Any matters requiring the approval of our shareholders will be significantly impacted by the Hagerman family (as defined below), which may have interests that differ from those of our other shareholders. See \"Philip Hagerman, a director and our former chairman and chief executive officer, has significant influence on the outcome of matters submitted for shareholder approval and they may have interests that differ from those of our other shareholders.\". In addition, the award agreements for outstanding stock options under our 2007 Option Plan generally provide that all unvested options will immediately vest upon a change in control. The 2014 Omnibus Plan permits the Board of Directors or a committee thereof to accelerate, vest, or cause the restrictions to lapse with respect to outstanding equity awards in the event of, or immediately prior to, a change in control. Although our more recent form of option awards contain \"double trigger\" vesting, such vesting or acceleration of earlier awards could discourage the acquisition of our Company.. 40. Table of Contents. We could also become subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under Michigan law which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us, whether or not an acquisition or merger is desired by or beneficial to our shareholders. If a corporation's board of directors chooses to \"opt-in\" to certain provisions of Michigan Law, such corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10 percent of the corporation's outstanding voting shares unless the holder has held the shares for five years or more or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the business combination. Our Board of Directors has not elected to be subject to this provision, but could do so in the future. Any provision of our amended and restated articles of incorporation or bylaws or Michigan law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock otherwise.. Philip Hagerman, a director and our former chairman and chief executive officer, has significant influence on the outcome of matters submitted for shareholder approval and he may have interests that differ from those of our other shareholders.. Philip Hagerman and various trusts affiliated with or for the benefit of Philip Hagerman or his wife (the \"Hagerman family\") beneficially own approximately 26.9 percent of our common stock as of February 28, 2018. Therefore, the Hagerman family will continue to have significant influence over the outcome of votes on all matters requiring approval by shareholders, including the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to our articles of incorporation and bylaws, and approval of a sale of the Company and other significant corporate transactions. Furthermore, the interests of the Hagerman family may be different than the interests of other shareholders. This concentration of voting power could also have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change in control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our shareholders."
