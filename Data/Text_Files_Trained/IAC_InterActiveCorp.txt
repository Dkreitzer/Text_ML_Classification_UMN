[1] "Item 1A.    Risk Factors. 12. Table of Contents. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information. This annual report on Form 10-K contains \"forward - looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The use of words such as \"anticipates,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"plans\" and \"believes,\" among others, generally identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements relating to: IAC's future financial performance, IAC's business prospects and strategy, anticipated trends and prospects in the industries in which IAC's businesses operate and other similar matters. These forward-looking statements are based on IAC management's expectations and assumptions about future events as of the date of this annual report, which are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict.. Actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward - looking statements for a variety of reasons, including, among others, the risk factors set forth below. Other unknown or unpredictable factors that could also adversely affect IAC's business, financial condition and results of operations may arise from time to time. In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward - looking statements discussed in this annual report may not prove to be accurate. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which only reflect the views of IAC management as of the date of this annual report. IAC does not undertake to update these forward - looking statements.. Risk Factors. Our success depends, in substantial part, on our continued ability to market, distribute and monetize our products and services through search engines, social media platforms and digital app stores.. The marketing, distribution and monetization of our products and services depends on our ability to cultivate and maintain cost-effective and otherwise satisfactory relationships with search engines, social media platforms and digital app stores, in particular, those operated by Google, Facebook and Apple. These platforms could decide not to market and distribute some or all of our products and services, change their terms and conditions of use at any time (and without notice), favor their own products and services over ours and/or significantly increase their fees. While we expect to maintain cost-effective and otherwise satisfactory relationships with these platforms, no assurances can be provided that we will be able to do so and our inability to do so in the case of one or more of these platforms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The risk factors below discuss these risks in the case of certain of our businesses in greater detail.. Our success depends, in part, upon the continued migration of certain markets and industries online and the continued growth and acceptance of online products and services as effective alternatives to traditional offline products and services.. Through our various businesses, we provide a variety of online products and services that continue to compete with their traditional offline counterparts. We believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online products and services generally will depend, to a large extent, on the continued growth in commercial use of the Internet (particularly abroad) and the continued migration of traditional offline markets and industries online.. For example, the success of the businesses within our Match Group segment depends, in substantial part, on the continued migration of the dating market online. We believe this migration will be driven, in substantial part, by the continued proliferation of mobile devices worldwide, which continues to expand the ways in which people can interact and build relationships, and increasing social acceptance and adoption of online dating products generally. The success of these businesses will also depend, in part, on our ability to continue to provide dating products that users find more efficient, effective, comfortable and convenient relative to traditional means of meeting people. The failure of a meaningful number of users to embrace our dating products and/or the return of a meaningful number of users to offline dating products and services could adversely affect the businesses within our Match Group segment, and in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Similarly, the success of the businesses within our ANGI Homeservices segment depends, in substantial part, on the continued migration of the home services market online. We believe that the digital penetration of the home services market remains low, with the vast majority of consumers continuing to search for, select and hire service professionals offline. While many consumer demographics have historically been (and remain) averse to finding service professionals online, others have demonstrated a greater willingness to embrace the online shift (for example, millennials). Service professionals must also embrace the online shift, which will depend, in substantial part, on whether online products and services help them to better connect and engage with consumers relative to traditional offline efforts. The speed and ultimate outcome of the shift of the home services market online for consumers and service professionals is uncertain and may not occur as quickly as we expect or at all. The failure or delay of a meaningful number of consumers and/or service professionals to migrate online and/or the return of a meaningful number of existing participants in the online home services market to offline markets could adversely. 13. Table of Contents. affect the businesses within our ANGI Homeservices segment, and in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Lastly, our success also depends, in part, on our ability to compete for a share of available advertising expenditures as more traditional offline and emerging media companies continue to enter the online advertising market, as well as the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising generally. In addition to the factors discussed above in the case of online products and services generally, we believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising generally will depend, in large part, on its perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of related advertising models (particularly in the case of mobile advertising), the extent to which web browsers, software programs and/or other applications that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry is able to effectively manage the continuing and increasing problem of click fraud. Any lack of growth in the market for online advertising (particularly for paid listings) and/or any decrease in the effectiveness and value of online advertising (whether due to changes in laws, changes in industry practices, the emergence of technologies that can block the display of advertisements across platforms or other developments) could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our success depends, in part, on our continued ability to introduce new and enhanced products and services that resonate with consumers.. We may not be able to convert traffic to our various platforms into repeat users, nor increase user engagement levels, unless we continue to introduce new and enhanced products and services in response to evolving trends and technologies in the various markets in which we operate, as well as provide quality products and services that otherwise resonate with consumers.. Online products and services and related systems, technology and infrastructure, as well as the manner in which consumers access online products and services generally, have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, subject to rapid change and continuing evolution. We may not be able to adapt quickly enough or at all to online trends generally and/or trends in the various markets and industries in which we operate (including changes in the preferences and needs of our users and consumers generally), appropriately time the introduction of new and enhanced products and services and/or identify new business opportunities in a timely manner. Moreover, the evolving preferences and needs of our users and consumers could require timely and costly updates to our products and services and related systems, technology and infrastructure.. While the continued introduction of new and/or enhanced products and services is critical to our success, by definition, new products and services have limited operating histories, which could make it difficult for us to evaluate our then current business and future prospects. For example, through Match Group, we seek to tailor each of our dating brands and products to meet the preferences of specific user communities. Building a given dating brand or product is generally an iterative process that occurs over a meaningful period of time and involves considerable resources and expenditures. Although certain of our newer dating brands and products have experienced significant growth over relatively short periods of time, the historical growth rates of these dating brands and products may not be an indication of future growth rates for our newer dating brands and products generally. We have encountered, and may continue to encounter, risks and difficulties as we build new and/or enhanced products and services.. Lastly, new technologies and policies could interfere with our ability to offer our products and services. For example, third parties continue to introduce technologies (including new and enhanced web browsers and operating systems) that may limit or prevent consumers from installing certain types of applications and/or have features and policies that significantly lessen the likelihood that consumers will install our applications or that previously installed applications will remain in active use. Our failure to successfully modify our products and services in a cost-effective manner in response to the introduction and adoption of new technologies, features and policies and/or find alternative sources of revenue to support products and services that currently generate revenue through advertising, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. The failure to successfully address any of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to our various brands and businesses may not be successful or cost-effective.. Traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing. We have made, and expect to continue to make, significant expenditures for search engine marketing (primarily in the form of the purchase of keywords, which we purchase primarily through Google and, to a lesser extent, Microsoft and Yahoo!), online display advertising and traditional offline advertising (including television and radio campaigns) in connection. 14. Table of Contents. with these initiatives, which may not be successful or cost-effective. Historically, we have had to increase advertising and marketing expenditures over time in order to attract and convert consumers, retain users and sustain our growth.. In the case of paid advertising generally, our ability to market our brands on any given property or channel is subject to the policies of the relevant third party seller, publisher of advertising (including search engines and social media platforms) or marketing affiliate. As a result, a third party could limit our ability to purchase certain types of advertising and/or advertise certain of our products and services, which could affect our ability to compete effectively and, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that third parties will not limit or prohibit one or more of our businesses from using certain current or prospective marketing channels in the future. If a significant marketing channel were to impose such a limitation or prohibition on one of more of our businesses generally, for a significant period of time and/or on a recurring basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, if we fail to comply with the policies of third party sellers, publishers of advertising and/or marketing affiliates, our advertisements could be removed without notice and/or our accounts could be suspended or terminated, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. In the case of our search engine marketing and optimization efforts, our failure to respond successfully to rapid and frequent changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines, as well as changing policies and guidelines applicable to keyword advertising (which may be unilaterally updated by search engines without advance notice), could adversely affect both our paid search engine marketing efforts and free search engine traffic. Such changes could adversely affect paid listings (both their placement and pricing), as well as the ranking of our brands and businesses within search results, any or all of which could increase our costs (particularly if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic) and adversely affect the effectiveness of our marketing efforts overall. Certain of our businesses engage in efforts similar to search engine optimization through Facebook and other social media platforms (for example, developing content designed to appear higher in a given Facebook News Feed and generate \"likes\") that involve challenges and risks similar to those we face in connection with our search engine marketing efforts.. Evolving consumer behavior can also affect the availability of cost-effective marketing opportunities. For example, as traditional television viewership declines and media is increasingly consumed through various digital means, the reach of traditional advertising channels is contracting and the number of digital advertising channels is expanding. To continue to reach consumers, engage with users and continue to grow in this environment, we will need to identify and devote more of our overall marketing expenditures to newer digital advertising channels (such as online video and other digital platforms), as well as targeted consumer and user campaigns via these channels. Generally, the opportunities in (and sophistication of) newer advertising channels are undeveloped and unproven relative to traditional channels, which could make it difficult for us to assess returns on our marketing investment in the case of these channels. In addition, as we increasingly depend on newer digital means for traffic, these efforts will involve challenges and risks similar to those we face in connection with our search engine marketing efforts.. Lastly, we also enter into various arrangements with third parties in an effort to drive traffic to our various brands and businesses, which arrangements are generally more cost-effective than traditional marketing efforts. If we are unable to renew existing (and enter into new) arrangements of this nature, sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the long-term.. Any failure to attract and acquire new (and retain existing) consumer traffic and users in a cost-effective manner could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Certain of our brands and businesses operate in especially competitive industries and innovation by our competitors in these industries could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. The dating and home services industries are competitive, with a consistent and growing stream of new products and entrants. Some of our competitors may enjoy better competitive positions in certain geographical areas and/or with consumer demographics that we currently serve or may serve in the future. In addition, some of our competitors, given the primary business in which they engage, can market their products and services online in a more prominent and cost-effective manner than we can. Any of these advantages could enable our competitors to offer products and services that are more appealing to consumers than our products and services and/or respond more quickly and/or cost effectively than we do to evolving market opportunities and trends. For example, search engine providers continue to expand their product and service offerings into non-search-related categories, including home services. Search engine providers can and may display their own integrated or related home services products and services in a more prominent manner than our products and services in search results. This could result in a substantial decrease in free and paid traffic to the businesses within our ANGI Homeservices segment and, in turn, increased marketing expenditures (particularly if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic).. 15. Table of Contents. In addition, within the dating and home services industries, costs for consumers to switch among products and services are low or non-existent. And in the case of service providers, while they would lose amounts paid for Marketplace membership packages and advertising if they switched to a competitor before the expiration of the related term, costs for switching over the long term are low. Low switching costs, coupled with the propensity of consumers to try new products and services generally, will most likely result in the continued emergence of new products and services, entrants and business models in the dating and home services industries. Our inability to compete effectively against current or future competitors and new products and services that may emerge could result in decreases in the size and level of engagement of our user and service provider bases, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to build, maintain and/or enhance our various brands.. Through our various businesses, we own and operate a number of widely known consumer brands with strong brand appeal within their respective markets and industries, as well as a number of emerging brands that we are in the process of building. We believe that our success depends, in large part, on our continued ability to maintain and enhance our established brands, as well as build awareness of (and loyalty to) our emerging brands. Our brands and brand-building efforts could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including product and service quality concerns, consumer complaints, actions brought by consumers, inappropriate and/or criminal actions taken by users and related media coverage, actions taken by governmental or regulatory authorities and data protection and security breaches. In addition, trust in the integrity and objective, unbiased nature of the ratings and reviews found across our home services brands (particularly Angie's List) contributes significantly to public perception of these brands and their ability to attract consumers and convert them into users. If consumers perceive that ratings and reviews are not authentic in general, the reputation and the strength of the relevant brand could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, the inability to develop and introduce products and services that resonate with consumers, adapt quickly enough (and/or in a cost effective manner) to evolving changes in the Internet and related technologies, applications and devices and market our products and services successfully (or in a cost-effective manner), could adversely affect our various brands and brand-building efforts, and in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and monetize versions of our products and services for mobile and other digital devices.. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and monetize versions of our products and services for mobile and other digital devices. As consumers increasingly access our products and services through mobile and other digital devices (including through digital voice assistants), we will need to devote significant time and resources to ensure that our products and services are accessible across these platforms (and multiple platforms generally). Despite these efforts, we may not be able to keep pace with evolving online trends generally and/or trends in the various markets and industries in which we operate (including changes in the preferences and needs of our users and consumers generally). Even if we do, new and/or enhanced products and services we offer may not resonate with consumers and, in turn, not generate sufficient traffic to our various brands and businesses. Moreover, we may not be able to monetize products and services for mobile and other digital devices as effectively as we have been able to monetize our traditional products and services.. In addition, the success of our mobile and digital applications is dependent on their interoperability with various third party operating systems, technology, infrastructure and standards over which we have no control and any changes to any of these things that compromise the quality or functionality of our mobile and digital applications could adversely affect their usage levels, and in turn, our ability to attract consumers and advertisers. Our failure or inability to successfully respond to the general shift of consumers to mobile and other digital devices could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Lastly, as technology continues to evolve, products and services that we develop for mobile and other digital devices could require us to modify our related systems, technology and infrastructure. If these modifications are not done in an efficient and cost-effective manner, our products and services for mobile and other digital devices (and related systems, technology and infrastructure) could be rendered obsolete.. The distribution and use of our products and services depends, in part, on third parties.. We distribute our products and services through a variety of third party publishers and distribution channels. For example, as consumers increasingly access our products and services through mobile applications, we (primarily in the case of our dating business and Apalon, one of the businesses within our Applications segment) increasingly depend upon the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store to distribute our mobile applications. Both Apple and Google have broad discretion to change their respective terms and conditions applicable to the distribution of our mobile applications, including those relating to the amount. 16. Table of Contents. of (and requirement to pay) certain fees associated with purchases facilitated by Apple and Google through our mobile applications, and to interpret their respective terms and conditions in ways that may limit, eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to distribute mobile applications through their stores. We cannot assure you that Apple or Google will not limit. eliminate or otherwise interfere with the distribution of our mobile applications. If either or both of them did so, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.. The use of certain of our products and services also depends, in part, on third parties. For example, many users of Match Group's Tinder and certain other dating products currently register for (and log in to) these dating products exclusively through their Facebook profiles. While Match Group recently launched an alternate authentication method that allows users to register for (and log into) Tinder using their mobile phone number, no assurances can be provided that this method will be widely adopted by users. Facebook has broad discretion to change its terms and conditions applicable to the use of its platform and to interpret its terms and conditions in ways that could limit, eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to use Facebook as an authentication method and if Facebook did so and the alternate method described above is not widely adopted by users or becomes unavailable for any reason, Match Group's, and in turn, our, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.. Lastly, certain of the businesses within our Applications segment have entered into (and expect to continue to enter into) agreements to distribute search boxes, browser extensions and other applications to users through third parties. Most of these agreements are either non-exclusive and short-term in nature or, in the case of long - term or exclusive agreements, are terminable by either party in certain specified circumstances. The inability of these businesses to enter into new (or renew existing) agreements to distribute search boxes, browser extensions and other applications through third parties for any reason would result in decreases in traffic to our various brands and businesses, queries and advertising revenue, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. General economic events or trends, particularly those that adversely impact advertising spending levels and consumer confidence and spending behavior, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We have historically been, and will continue to be, particularly sensitive to events and trends that adversely impact advertising spending levels and consumer confidence and spending behavior. A significant portion of our consolidated revenue (and a substantial portion of our net cash from operations that we can freely access), is attributable to online advertising, primarily revenue from our Applications and Publishing segments. Accordingly, we are particularly sensitive to events and trends that could result in decreased advertising expenditures. Advertising expenditures have historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns, as well as levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending.. Similarly, some of our businesses (primarily those within our ANGI Homeservices segment) are particularly sensitive to events and trends that adversely impact consumer confidence and spending behavior. For example, in the event of a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions, consumer confidence, spending levels and access to credit could be adversely affected. The occurrence of any of these events or trends could result in consumers delaying or foregoing home services projects, which could result in decreases in Marketplace service requests and related fees paid by Marketplace service professionals for consumer matches, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. In addition, because a significant number of service professionals across ANGI Homeservices brands are sole proprietorships and small businesses, they may be particularly impacted by events and trends that adversely impact consumer confidence, spending behavior and access to credit. If so, they may be less likely to pay for Marketplace membership and/or advertising, which could result in turnover at the Marketplace and/or any of our directories. Any significant and/or recurring turnover over a prolonged period could adversely impact the number and quality of service professionals in the Marketplace and our directories, as well as the reach of (and breadth of services offered through) the Marketplace and our directories, any or all of which could result in a decrease in traffic to ANGI Homeservices brands and businesses and increased costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. In the recent past, adverse economic conditions have caused, and if such conditions were to recur in the future they could cause, decreases and/or delays in advertising expenditures and discretionary spending by consumers and limited access to credit, which would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. 17. Table of Contents. Communicating with users and consumers via e-mail is critical to our success, and any erosion in our ability to communicate in this fashion that is not sufficiently replaced by other means could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Historically, one of our primary means of communicating with consumers and keeping our users engaged with our products and services has been via e-mail communication. As consumer habits continue to evolve in the era of mobile and other digital devices and messaging and social media apps, usage of e-mail, particularly among younger consumers, has declined and we expect this trend to continue. In addition, deliverability and other restrictions imposed by third party e-mail providers and/or applicable law could limit or prevent our ability to send e-mails to consumers and users. A continued and significant erosion in our ability to communicate successfully with consumers and users via e-mail could have an adverse impact on the user experience, user engagement levels and the rate at which non - paying users become paid subscribers. While we continually work to find new means of communicating and connecting with consumers and our users (for example, through push notifications), we cannot assure you that such alternative means of communication will be as effective as e-mail has been historically. Any failure to develop or take advantage of new means of communication and/or limitations on such means imposed by applicable law, mobile and digital device manufacturers or otherwise could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Each of our dating products monetizes users at different rates. If a meaningful migration of our user base from our higher monetizing dating products to our lower monetizing dating products were to occur, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Through Match Group, we own, operate and manage a large and diverse portfolio of dating products. Each dating product has its own mix of free and paid features designed to optimize the user experience for, and revenue generation from, that product's user community. In general, the mix of features for the various dating products within our more established brands leads to higher monetization rates per user than the mix of features for the various dating products within our newer brands. If a significant portion of our user base were to migrate to our less profitable dating brands, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.. As the distribution of our dating products through digital app stores increases, in order to maintain our profit margins, we may need to offset increasing digital app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures, increasing user volume or monetization per user or by engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally, or our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.. As users of our dating products continue to shift to mobile and other digital devices, we increasingly rely upon the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store to distribute our mobile applications. While our mobile dating applications are generally free to download from these stores, users can purchase subscriptions and certain à la carte features through these applications. We determine the prices at which these subscriptions and features are sold; however, related purchases must be processed through the in-app payment systems provided by Apple and, to a lesser extent, Google. As a result, we pay Apple and Google, as applicable, a share (generally 30%) of the revenue we receive from these transactions. While we are constantly innovating on and creating our own payment systems and methods, given the increasing distribution of our dating products through digital app stores and in-app payment system requirements, we may need to offset these increased digital app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures as a percentage of revenue, increasing user volume or monetization per user or engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally, or our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.. Our success depends, in part, of the ability of ANGI Homeservices to establish and maintain relationships with quality service professionals.. We will need to continue to attract, retain and grow the number of skilled and reliable service professionals who can provide home services that consumers want in a timely manner across ANGI Homeservices platforms. To do so, we must continue to offer products and services that resonate with consumers and service professionals generally, as well provide service professionals with an attractive return on their marketing and advertising investments. If we fail to provide compelling products and services across ANGI Homeservices brands and businesses, Marketplace service professionals may leave (or fail to join) the Marketplace and certified service professionals may leave (of fail to join) the Angie's List nationwide online directory, one or both of which would result in a less attractive overall digital marketplace for consumers seeking quality service professionals. Any decrease in quality service professionals (or the lack of new quality service professionals) would result in a smaller and less diverse Marketplace and smaller and less diverse directories, which could adversely impact the consumer experience, and in turn, result in decreases in service requests and directory searches, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.. 18. Table of Contents. We depend upon arrangements with Google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. A meaningful portion of our consolidated revenue (and a substantial portion of our net cash from operations that we can freely access) is attributable to a services agreement with Google. Pursuant to this agreement, we display and syndicate paid listings provided by Google in response to search queries generated by users of our Applications and Publishing properties. In exchange for making our search traffic available to Google, we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us, as well as certain other search - related services. Our current agreement with Google expires on March 31, 2020 and we may choose to terminate this agreement effective March 31, 2019.. The amount of revenue we receive from Google depends on a number of factors outside of our control, including the amount Google charges for advertisements, the efficiency of Google's system in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings in response to search queries and parameters established by Google regarding the number and placement of paid listings displayed in response to search queries. In addition, Google makes judgments about the relative attractiveness (to advertisers) of clicks on paid listings from searches performed on our Applications and Publishing properties and these judgments factor into the amount of revenue we receive. Google also makes judgments about the relative attractiveness (to users) of paid listings from searches and these judgments factor into the amount of advertisements we can purchase. Changes to the amount Google charges advertisers, the efficiency of Google's paid listings network, Google's judgment about the relative attractiveness to advertisers of clicks on paid listings from our Applications and Publishing properties or to the parameters applicable to the display of paid listings generally could result in a decrease in the amount of revenue we receive from Google and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such changes could come about for a number of reasons, including general market conditions, competition or policy and operating decisions made by Google.. Our services agreement with Google also requires that we comply with certain guidelines for the use of Google brands and services, including guidelines that govern which products and applications may access Google services, and the manner in which Google's paid listings are displayed within search results across various third party platforms and products (including our Applications and Publishing properties). Our services agreement also requires that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings, including the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display paid listings. Google may generally unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice, which could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of, our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Noncompliance with Google's guidelines by us or the third parties to whom we are permitted to syndicate paid listings or through which we secure distribution arrangements for certain of our Applications properties could, if not cured, result in the suspension of some or all Google services to our properties (or the websites of our third party partners) and/or the termination of the services agreement by Google.. The termination of the services agreement by Google, the curtailment of our rights under the agreement (whether pursuant to the terms thereof or otherwise) and/or the failure of Google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of these events were to occur, we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider (or if an alternate provider were found, the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with, and the paid listings supplied by, Google) or otherwise replace the lost revenues.. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.. We operate in certain foreign markets, primarily in various jurisdictions within the European Union, and as a result, are exposed to foreign exchange risk for both the Euro and British Pound (\"GBP\"). During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, approximately 30% and 26%, respectively, of our total revenues were international revenues. We translate international revenues into U.S. Dollar-denominated results. As a result, as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate, the translation of the statement of operations of our international businesses into U.S. Dollars affects the period-over-period comparability of operating results. The average GBP and Euro versus the U.S. Dollar exchange rate was approximately 5% higher and 2% lower, respectively, in 2017 compared to 2016.. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange gains and losses to the extent we or are subsidiaries conduct transactions in, and/or have assets and/or liabilities that are denominated in, a currency other than the relevant entity's functional currency. We recorded foreign currency exchange losses of $16.8 million and gains of $34.4 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in GBP versus the U.S. Dollar during 2017 and the decrease in the GBP versus the U.S. Dollar during 2016 following the Brexit vote on June 23, 2016 generated the majority of. 19. Table of Contents. our foreign currency exchange losses and gains during these fiscal years. For additional detail regarding these gains and losses, see \"Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Risk.\". Foreign currency exchange gains and losses historically have not been material to the Company. As a result, historically, we have not hedged our foreign currency exposures. The continued growth and expansion of our international operations into new markets and jurisdictions increases our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, in the case of one currency or collectively with other currencies, could adversely affect our future results of operations.. We may not be able to protect our systems, technology and infrastructure from cyberattacks. In addition, we may be adversely impacted by cyberattacks experienced by third parties. Any disruption of our systems, technology and infrastructure or compromise of our user data or other information due to cyberattacks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We are regularly under attack by perpetrators of malicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software, distributed denial of service attacks, attempts to misappropriate user information (including credit card information) or other malicious activities. Events of this nature could compromise the integrity of our systems, technology and infrastructure, as well as our various products and services, which could in turn adversely affect our users. The incidence of events of this nature (or any combination thereof) is on the rise worldwide.. While we continuously develop and maintain systems to detect and prevent events of this nature from impacting our various businesses (and their respective systems, technology, infrastructure, products, services and users), and have invested (and continue to invest) heavily in these efforts and related personnel and training, these efforts are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome preventative security measures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, we cannot assure you that we will not experience significant events of this nature in the future and if such an event does occur, that it will not adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Any cyberattack or security breach we experience could damage our systems, technology and infrastructure and/or those of our users, prevent us from providing our products and services, compromise the integrity of our products and services, damage our reputation, erode our brands and/or be costly to remedy, as well as subject us to investigations by regulatory authorities, fines and/or litigation that could result in liability to third parties. Even if we do not experience such events, the impact of any such events experienced by third parties with whom we do business (or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our operations) could have a similar effect. Moreover, even cyberattacks and security breaches that do not impact us directly may result in consumers being less likely to use online products and services generally.. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses resulting from any of these events.. If the security of personal, confidential or sensitive user information, including credit card information, that we maintain and store is breached or otherwise accessed by unauthorized persons, it may be costly to mitigate the impact of such an event, our reputation could be harmed and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.. We receive, process, store and transmit a significant amount of personal, confidential or sensitive user or other information, including credit card information, and in the case of certain of our products and services, enable users to share their personal information with each other. In some cases, we retain third party vendors to store this information. While we continuously develop and maintain systems to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of this information, we cannot guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts. If any such event were to occur, we may not be able to remedy the event, and we may have to expend significant capital and other resources to mitigate the impact of such an event, and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring. If a breach of our security (or the security of third party vendors we have retained) occurs, the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and our reputation may be harmed, we could lose users and the recognition of our various brands and businesses and their competitive positions could be diminished, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. 20. Table of Contents. We are subject to a number of risks related to credit card payments, including data security breaches, fraud that we or third parties experience or additional regulation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Certain of our businesses accept payment (including recurring payments) from users, primarily through credit card transactions and certain online payment service providers. The ability of these businesses to access payment information on a real time - basis without having to proactively reach out to users to process payments for products and services (including auto-renewal payments or payments for premium features on or with certain of our products or services) is critical to our success.. When we or a third party experience(s) a data security breach involving credit card information, affected cardholders will often cancel their cards. In the case of a breach experienced by a third party, the more sizable the third party's customer base,  the greater the number of accounts impacted and the more likely it is that our users would be impacted by such a breach. If our users are ever affected by such a breach, we would need to contact affected individuals to obtain new payment information and process any pending transactions. It is likely that we would not be able to reach all affected individuals, and even if we could, new payment information for some individuals may not be obtained and some pending transactions may not be processed, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Even if our users are not directly impacted by a given data security breach, they may lose confidence in the ability of providers of online products and services to protect their personal information generally, which could cause them to stop using their credit cards online and choose alternative payment methods that are not as convenient for us or restrict our ability to process payments without significant effort.. Our ability to access credit card information on a real-time basis without having to proactively reach out to affected individuals could also be adversely impacted by increases in various fees charged by credit card companies and processors (such as transaction, interchange, chargeback and/or other fees), the malfunction of credit card billing systems and software and non-compliance with applicable payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (\"PCI DSS\"), a security standard with which companies that collect, store or transmit certain data related to credit and debit cards, credit and debit card holders and credit and debit card transactions are required to comply.. If we fail to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions and/or comply with the PCI DSS, we could face litigation, fines, governmental enforcement action, civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures, significantly higher credit card-related costs and substantial remediation costs, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. The processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities and increased costs as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights and compliance with laws designed to prevent unauthorized access of personal data could be costly.. We receive, transmit and store a large volume of personal information and other user data (including personal credit card data, as well as private content (such as videos and correspondence)) in connection with the processing of search queries, the provision of online products and services, payment transactions and advertising on our various properties. The manner in which we share, store, use, disclose and protect this information is determined by the respective privacy and data security policies of our various businesses. These policies are, in turn, subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as evolving industry standards and practices, regarding privacy generally and the sharing, storage, use, disclosure and protection of personal information and user data. These laws, regulations, standards and practices are changing, inconsistent and conflicting and subject to differing interpretations, and new laws, regulations, standards and practices of this nature are proposed and adopted from time to time.. For example, in 2016, the European Commission adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\"), a comprehensive European Union privacy and data protection reform that becomes effective in May 2018. The GDPR, which applies to companies that are organized in the European Union (or otherwise provide services to (or monitor) consumers who reside in the European Union), imposes strict standards regarding the sharing, storage, use, disclosure and protection of end user data and significant penalties (monetary and otherwise) for non-compliance. In addition, the European Union is considering an update to its Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive to impose stricter rules regarding the use of cookies in connection with the provision of online products and services to consumers who reside in the European Union. In addition, the potential exit from the European Union by the United Kingdom could result in the application of new and. 21. Table of Contents. conflicting data privacy and protection laws and standards to our operations in the United Kingdom and how we handle personal data of consumers who reside in the United Kingdom. In addition, there are a number of draft privacy laws and regulations under consideration in the U.S. (including in various states) and in various foreign jurisdictions in which we do business.. While we believe that we comply with applicable privacy policies, laws and regulations, as well as evolving industry standards and practices relating to privacy and data security in all material respects, there is no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that we have violated applicable laws and regulations, standards and practices, that we will be able to successfully defend against such claims or that we will not be subject to significant fines and penalties in the event of non-compliance. Moreover, any failure or perceived failure by us (or the third parties with whom we have contracted to handle such information) to comply with applicable privacy policies, laws, regulations or privacy - related contractual obligations or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to (or use or transmission of) personal information could result in a variety of claims against us, including governmental enforcement actions, significant fines, litigation, claims of breach of contract and indemnity by third parties and adverse publicity. In the case of such an event, our reputation may be harmed, we could lose current and potential users and the competitive positions of our various brands and businesses could be diminished, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. In addition, compliance with the numerous privacy and data protection laws in the various countries in which our businesses operate (particularly the GDPR) could be costly, as well as result in delays in the development of new products and services if significant resources are allocated to compliance efforts, particularly as these laws become more comprehensive in scope, more commonplace and continue to evolve. If these costs and/or product and service delays are significant, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.. Lastly, evolving privacy and data protection laws in the various countries in which are businesses operate could prevent us from introducing products and services in jurisdictions in which we wish to do business and/or continuing to offer certain products and services in jurisdictions in which we currently operate. If markets in new jurisdictions in which we cannot do business are large and/or revenue attributable to products and services we can no longer offer is significant, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.. Our success depends, in part, on the integrity and quality of our systems, technology and infrastructure and those of third parties. System interruptions and the lack of integration and redundancy in our and third party information systems may adversely affect our business.. To succeed, our systems, technology and infrastructure must perform well on a consistent basis. From time to time, we may experience occasional interruptions that make some or all of our systems, technology, infrastructure or user data unavailable or that prevent us from providing products and services; any such interruption could arise for any number of reasons. Furthermore, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God and other similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer, data, cloud-based web hosting, broadband, wireless or other storage or communications systems at any time. Any event of this nature could cause system interruptions, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing our products and services to consumers. While we have backup systems in place for certain aspects of our operations, our systems, technology and infrastructure are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.  Any such interruptions or outages, regardless of the cause, could negatively impact the consumer experience, tarnish the reputation of our brands and decrease demand for our products and services, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We also continually work to expand and enhance the efficiency and scalability of our systems, technology and infrastructure to improve the consumer experience, accommodate substantial increases in traffic volume to our various brands, ensure acceptable page load times and keep up with technology and evolving user and consumer preferences. Any failure to do so in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely affect the user experience across our brands and businesses, which could adversely affect demand for our products and services and/or increase our costs, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We also rely on third party computer systems, data center service providers, cloud-based web hosting service providers and  broadband, wireless and other communications systems service providers in connection with the provision of our products and services generally, as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with users. We have no control over any of these third parties or their operations.. 22. Table of Contents. Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems, technology and infrastructure or those of our third party providers, changes in service levels or any deterioration in performance, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and/or process certain transactions.  If any of these events were to occur, it could damage our reputation and result in the loss of users, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and otherwise be costly to remedy.. Mr. Diller and certain members of his family collectively have sole voting and/or investment power over a significant percentage of the voting power of our stock. As a result, Mr. Diller and these family members are able to exercise significant influence over the composition of our Board of Directors, matters subject to stockholder approval and our operations.. As of the date of this report, Mr. Diller, his spouse, Diane von Furstenberg, and his stepson, Alexander von Furstenberg, collectively beneficially own 5,789,499 shares of IAC Class B common stock by virtue of their respective voting and/or investment power(s) over these securities, 4,530,075 of which are held in trusts for the benefit of Mr. Diller and certain members of his family and the remainder of which are held by Mr. Diller personally. Shares of IAC Class B common stock beneficially owned by Mr. Diller, his spouse and his stepson collectively represent 100% of IAC's outstanding Class B common stock and, together with shares of IAC common stock held as of the date of this report by Mr. von Furstenberg (58,542), a trust for the benefit of certain members of Mr. Diller's family (136,711) and a family foundation (1,711), represent approximately 43.1% of the total outstanding voting power of IAC (based on the number of shares of IAC common stock outstanding on February 2, 2018). As of the date of this report, Mr. Diller also holds 800,000 vested options and 500,000 unvested options to purchase IAC common stock.. In addition, pursuant to an amended and restated governance agreement between IAC and Mr. Diller, for so long as Mr. Diller serves as IAC's Chairman and Senior Executive and he beneficially owns (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) at least 5,000,000 shares of IAC Class B common stock and/or common stock in which he has a pecuniary interest (including IAC securities beneficially owned by him directly and indirectly through trusts for the benefit of him and certain members of his family), he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that IAC's ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the governance agreement) equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve-month period.. As a result of IAC securities beneficially owned by Mr. Diller and certain members of his family, Mr. Diller and these family members are, collectively, currently in a position to influence, subject to our organizational documents and Delaware law, the composition of IAC's Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers, business combinations and dispositions of assets, among other corporate transactions. In addition, this concentration of investment and voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to IAC, which could adversely affect the market price of IAC securities.. We depend on our key personnel.. Our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled individuals, with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success. Competition for well-qualified employees across IAC and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends, in part, upon our ability to attract new employees. While we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees, particularly our senior management, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future. Effective succession planning is also important to our future success. If we fail to ensure the effective transfer of senior management knowledge to successors and smooth transitions involving senior management across our various businesses, our ability to execute short and long term strategic, financial and operating goals, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations generally, could be adversely affected.. Our indebtedness may affect our ability to operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness.. As of December 31, 2017, we had total debt outstanding of approximately $2.1 billion, including $1.3 billion and $275 million of total debt outstanding at Match Group and ANGI Homeservices, respectively. As of that date, we had borrowing availability of $300 million, and Match Group had borrowing availability of $500 million, under our respective revolving credit facilities. Neither Match Group, ANGI Homeservices nor any of their respective subsidiaries guarantee any indebtedness of IAC or are currently subject to any of the covenants related to such indebtedness. Similarly, neither IAC nor any of its subsidiaries (other than Match Group and its subsidiaries in the case of Match Group indebtedness and ANGI Homeservices and its subsidiaries in the case of ANGI Homeservices indebtedness) guarantee any indebtedness of Match Group or ANGI Homeservices nor are subject to any of the covenants related to such indebtedness.. 23. Table of Contents. The terms of the indebtedness of IAC, Match Group and ANGI Homeservices could:.  limit our respective abilities to obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditures or other debt service requirements or for other purposes;.  limit our respective abilities to use operating cash flow in other areas of our respective businesses because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service indebtedness;.  limit our respective abilities to compete with other companies who are not as highly leveraged;.  restrict any one or more of us from making strategic acquisitions, developing properties or exploiting business opportunities;.  restrict the way in which one or more of us conducts business because of financial and operating covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness;.  expose one or more of us to potential events of default under financial and operating covenants contained in our respective debt instruments, which if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results;.  increase our respective vulnerabilities to a downturn in general economic conditions or in pricing of our various products and services; and.  limit our respective abilities to react to changing market conditions in the various industries in which we do business.. In addition to our respective debt service obligations, the operations of IAC, Match Group and ANGI Homeservices require substantial investments on a continuing basis. The ability of any of us to make scheduled debt payments, to refinance indebtedness obligations and to fund capital and non-capital expenditures necessary to maintain the condition of our respective operating assets and properties, as well as to provide capacity for the growth of our respective businesses, depends on our respective financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legal and other factors.. Subject to certain restrictions in the agreements governing certain indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness, including additional unsecured and secured indebtedness. Although the terms of agreements governing certain indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be significant. If we and/or any of our subsidiaries incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase.. Also, if an event a default has occurred or our leverage ratio exceeds thresholds specified in the agreements governing our indebtedness, our ability to pay dividends or to make distributions and repurchase or redeem our stock would be limited and the agreements governing the indebtedness of Match Group and ANGI Homeservices contain similar restrictions. See \"Item 7-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources-Financial Position.\". We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful.. The ability of IAC, Match Group and ANGI Homeservices to satisfy our respective debt obligations will depend upon, among other things:.  our respective future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control; and.  the future ability of IAC and Match Group to borrow under our respective revolving credit agreements, as well as the future ability of ANGI Homeservices to add one or more incremental term loans or revolving facilities under its credit agreement, the availability of which will depend on, among other things, compliance with the covenants in the agreements governing such indebtedness.. 24. Table of Contents. We cannot assure you that we, Match Group of ANGI Homeservices will generate sufficient cash flow from our respective operations, or that we, Match Group or ANGI Homeservices will be able to otherwise take the actions described immediately above, in amounts sufficient to fund our respective liquidity needs. See also \"-We may not freely access the cash of Match Group, ANGI Homeservices and their respective subsidiaries\" below.. If cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations, sell equity, and/or negotiate with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt, in order to meet our debt service and other obligations.  We may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all. The agreements governing the indebtedness of IAC, Match Group and/or ANGI Homeservices may restrict, or market or business conditions may limit, our ability to avail ourselves of some or all of these options.  Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due.. We may not freely access the cash of Match Group, ANGI Homeservices and their respective subsidiaries.. IAC's potential sources of cash include our available cash balances, net cash from the operating activities of certain of our subsidiaries, availability under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from asset sales, including marketable securities. The ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on their individual operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or become subject. The agreements governing the indebtedness of Match Group and ANGI Homeservices limit their ability to pay dividends or make distributions, loans or advances to stockholders, including IAC. In addition, because Match Group and ANGI Homeservices are separate and distinct legal entities with public shareholders, they have no obligation to provide us with funds, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments.. Variable rate indebtedness will subject us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.. As of December 31, 2017, Match Group and ANGI Homeservices had $425 million and $275 million, respectively, of indebtedness outstanding under their respective term loans. Borrowings under both term loans are, and any borrowings under the revolving credit facilities of IAC or Match Group will be, at variable interest rates. Indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates exposes us to interest rate risk. Match Group's term loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.50% and as of December 31, 2017, the rate in effect was 3.85%.  If LIBOR were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points, then the annual interest expense on the Match Group term loan would increase or decrease by $4.3 million. The ANGI Homeservices term loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00% and as of December 31, 2017, the rate in effect was 3.38%. If LIBOR were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points, then the annual interest expense on the ANGI Homeservices term loan would increase or decrease by $2.8 million. See also \"Item 7A-Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\". You may experience dilution with respect to your investment in IAC, and IAC may experience dilution with respect to its investments in Match Group and ANGI Homeservices, as a result of compensatory equity awards.. We have issued various compensatory equity awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock unit awards denominated in shares of our common stock, as well as in equity of our various consolidated subsidiaries, including Match Group and ANGI Homeservices.  For more information regarding these awards and their impact on our diluted earnings per share calculation, see \"Note 13-Stock-Based Compensation\" and \"Note 12-Earnings Per Share,\" respectively, to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Item 8-Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\". The issuance of shares of IAC common stock in settlement of these equity awards could dilute your ownership interest in IAC. Awards denominated in shares of Match Group or ANGI Homeservices common stock that are settled in shares of those subsidiaries could dilute IAC's ownership interest in Match Group and ANGI Homeservices, respectively. The dilution of our ownership stake(s) in Match Group and/or ANGI Homeservices could impact our ability, among other things, to maintain Match Group and/or ANGI Homeservices as part of our consolidated tax group for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to effect a tax-free distribution of our Match Group and/or ANGI Homeservices stake(s) to our stockholders or to maintain control of Match Group and/or ANGI Homeservices. As we generally have the right to maintain our levels of ownership in Match Group. 25. Table of Contents. and ANGI Homeservices to the extent Match Group or ANGI Homeservices issues additional shares of their respective capital stock in the future pursuant to investor rights agreements, we do not intend to allow any of the foregoing to occur.. With respect to awards denominated in shares of our non-publicly traded subsidiaries, we estimate the dilutive impact of those awards based on our estimated fair value of those subsidiaries. Those estimates may change from time to time, and the fair value determined in connection with vesting and liquidity events could lead to more or less dilution than reflected in our diluted earnings per share calculation.. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and even if we do so, we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions and/or not realize anticipated benefits following acquisitions. In addition, some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value.. We have made numerous acquisitions in the past and we continue to seek to identify potential acquisition candidates that will allow us to apply our expertise to expand their capabilities, as well as maximize our existing assets. As a result, our future growth may depend, in part, on acquisitions. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on satisfactory pricing or other terms and we expect to continue to experience competition in connection with our acquisition-related efforts.. Even if we identify what we believe to be suitable acquisition candidates and negotiate satisfactory terms, we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions, and to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions, we will need to:.  properly value prospective acquisitions, especially those with limited operating histories;.  successfully integrate the operations, as well as the accounting, financial controls, management information, technology, human resources and other administrative systems, of acquired businesses with our existing operations and systems;.  successfully identify and realize potential synergies among acquired and existing businesses;.  retain or hire senior management and other key personnel at acquired businesses; and.  successfully manage acquisition - related strain on the management, operations and financial resources of IAC and its businesses and/or acquired businesses.. We may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions, including the Combination. In addition, the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions, including the anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities we expect to realize as a result of the Combination, may not be realized. Also, future acquisitions could result in increased operating losses, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the assumption of contingent liabilities. Lastly, the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events and/or trends, which could result in significant impairment charges.  The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We operate in various international markets, some in which we have limited experience. As a result, we face additional risks in connection with our international operations. Also, we may not be able to successfully expand into new, or further into our existing, international markets.. We currently operate in various jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence. In order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to achieve widespread acceptance, commercial use and acceptance of the Internet (particularly via mobile devices) must continue to grow, which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced in the United States. Moreover, we must continue to successfully tailor our products and services to the unique customs and cultures of foreign jurisdictions, which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our international growth and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Operating abroad, particularly in jurisdictions where we have limited experience, exposes us to additional risks, including among others:.  operational and compliance challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences;. 26. Table of Contents.  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;.  differing levels of social and technological acceptance of our products and services or lack of acceptance of them generally;.  foreign currency fluctuations;.  restrictions on the transfer of funds among countries and back to the United States and costs associated with repatriating funds to the United States;.  differing and potentially adverse tax laws;.  multiple, conflicting and changing laws, rules and regulations, and difficulties understanding and ensuring compliance with those laws by both our employees and our business partners, over whom we exert no control;.  competitive environments that favor local businesses;.  limitations on the level of intellectual property protection; and.  trade sanctions, political unrest, terrorism, war and epidemics or the threat of any of these events.. The occurrence of any or all of these events could adversely affect our international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success in international markets will also depend, in part, on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates, joint venture or other partners, and to enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms and successfully integrate their businesses and operations with our own.. A variety of new laws, or new interpretations of existing laws, could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.. We are subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort, can subject us to claims or other remedies and otherwise harm our business.  Some of these laws, such as income, sales, use, value - added and other tax laws and consumer protection laws, are applicable to businesses generally and others are unique to the various types of businesses in which we are engaged. Many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies. Laws that do reference the Internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain. In addition, evolving Internet business practices may attract increased legal and regulatory attention. For example, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission continues to monitor the use of paid search and online \"native\" advertising (a form of advertising in which sponsored content is presented in a manner that could be viewed as similar to traditional editorial content) to ensure that it is presented in a manner that is not confusing or deceptive.. Any failure on our part to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if the laws to which we are currently subject are amended or interpreted adversely to our interests, or if new adverse laws are adopted, our products and services might need to be modified to comply with such laws, which would increase our costs and could result in decreased demand for our products and services to the extent that we pass on such costs to our users. Specifically, in the case of tax laws, positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities. While we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law, there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position, and if so, that such positions will not adversely affect us. Any events of this nature could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Moreover, laws that adversely impact use (or growth in use) of the Internet or that regulate the practices of third parties upon which we rely to provide our online products and services could decrease user demand for our products and services,  increase costs or otherwise harm our business. For example, in December 2017, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (the \"FCC\") adopted an order reversing its May 2016 Open Internet Order, which codified \"network neutrality,\" the principle that Internet service providers should treat all data traveling through their networks the same, not discriminating or charging differentially by content, website, platform or application. As a result of this reversal, broadband Internet access providers now have more power to prioritize different types of Internet traffic and set pricing, which means they could discriminate against Internet traffic of our businesses in favor of others (by way of blocking or throttling traffic from our businesses, \"paid prioritization\" of traffic through their networks generally or other similar actions) and/or charge us to provide our products and. 27. Table of Contents. services via their networks. If any of these actions were to occur, our costs could increase and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.. Lastly, the passage or adoption of any new or amended legislation or regulation affecting the ability of our businesses to periodically charge for recurring membership or subscription payments could harm our business. For example, the European Union Payment Services directive, which became effective in January 2018 and regulates payment services and payment service providers, could restrict the ability of certain of our businesses to process auto-renewal payments for, as well offer promotional or differentiated pricing tiers to, users who reside in the European Union.. We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties.. We rely heavily upon our trademarks and related domain names and logos to market our brands and to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition, as well as upon trade secrets.  We also rely, to a lesser extent, upon patented and patent-pending proprietary technologies with expiration dates ranging from 2019 to 2038.. We rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights.  For example, we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew, or secure by contract where appropriate, trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve, register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate.  Effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract.  Similarly, not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered, even if available.. We also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate, based on then current facts and circumstances, and will continue to do so in the future.  No assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed (or will file) will result in a patent being issued, or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors and similar technologies.  In addition, no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own.. Despite these measures, our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner, challenges to contractual rights could arise, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization and/or laws (or interpretations of laws) regarding the enforceability of our existing intellectual property rights can change in an adverse manner. The occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brands and limitations on our ability to control marketing on or through the Internet using our various domain names, as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. From time to time, we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties.  In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others.  Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive."
