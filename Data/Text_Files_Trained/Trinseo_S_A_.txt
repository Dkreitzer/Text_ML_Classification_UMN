[1] "Item 1A.    Risk Factors. Risks Related to Our Business. Volatility in energy and the cost of the raw materials utilized for our products, or disruption in the supply of the raw materials utilized for our products, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or cause our financial results to differ materially from our forecasts.. Our results of operations can be directly affected, positively and negatively, by volatility in the cost of our raw materials, which are subject to global supply and demand and other factors beyond our control. Our principal raw materials (benzene, ethylene, butadiene, BPA and styrene) together represent approximately 65% of our total cost of goods sold. Additionally, we use natural gas and electricity to operate our facilities and generate heat and steam for our various manufacturing processes. Crude oil prices also impact our raw material and energy costs. Generally, higher crude oil prices lead to higher costs of natural gas and raw materials, although some raw materials are impacted less than others. Volatility in the cost of energy or raw materials makes it more challenging to manage pricing and pass the increases on to our customers in a timely manner. We believe that rapid changes in pricing also can affect the volume our customers consume. As a result, our gross profit and margins could also be adversely affected and our financial results may differ materially from our forecasts.. We have long-term supply agreements with Dow for ethylene, benzene, and butadiene, which are critical raw materials to our business and expire in June 2020. These raw materials and other less critical materials amount to approximately 31% of our raw materials (based on aggregate purchase price). The remainder is purchased via other third-party suppliers on a global basis. As our Dow contracts and other third-party contracts expire, we may be unable to. 20. Table of Contents. renew these contracts or obtain new long-term supply agreements on terms comparable or favorable to us, depending on market conditions, which may significantly impact our operations.  See Item 1 - Business -   Sources and Availability of Raw Materials.. If the availability of any of our principal raw materials is limited, we may be unable to produce some of our products in the quantities demanded by our customers, which could have an adverse effect on plant utilization and our sales of products requiring such raw materials. Suppliers may have temporary limitations preventing them from meeting our requirements, and we may not be able to obtain substitute alternative suppliers in a timely manner or on favorable terms.. Conditions in the global economy and capital markets may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. Our products are sold in markets that are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, such as sales of automotive and construction products. Downturns in general economic conditions can cause fluctuations in demand for our products, product prices, volumes and margins.. Turbulence in the credit markets, fluctuating commodity prices, volatile exchange rates and other challenges affecting the global economy can affect us and our customers. Instability in financial and commodity markets throughout the world may cause, among other things, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations and pricing volatility of others, volatile energy and raw materials costs, geopolitical issues and failure and the potential failure of major financial institutions. Adverse events affecting the health of the economy, including sovereign debt and economic crises, refugee crises, terrorism, Brexit, rising protectionism, and the threat of war, could have a negative impact on the health of the global economy. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions or on the stability of global financial markets. During any period of uncertainty or heightened market volatility, consumer confidence may decline which could lead to a decline in demand for our products or a shift to lower-margin products, which could adversely affect sales of our products and our profitability and could also result in impairments of certain of our assets.. Deterioration in the financial and credit market heightens the risk of customer bankruptcies and delay in payment. We are unable to predict the duration of the current economic conditions or their effects on financial markets, our business and results of operations. If economic conditions deteriorate, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.. We may engage in strategic acquisitions or dispositions of certain assets and/or businesses that could affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.. We may selectively pursue complementary acquisitions and joint ventures, each of which inherently involves a number of risks and presents financial, managerial and operational challenges, including, but not limited to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulty with integration of personnel and financial and other systems;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thiring additional management and other critical personnel; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.. In addition, we may encounter unforeseen obstacles or costs in the integration of acquired businesses. Also, the presence of one or more material liabilities of an acquired company that are unknown to us at the time of acquisition may have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results. Our acquisition and joint venture strategy may not be successfully received by customers, and we may not realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures.. We may also opportunistically pursue dispositions of certain assets and/or businesses, which may involve material amounts of assets or lines of business, and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. If any such dispositions were to occur, under the terms of the Credit Agreement governing our Senior Credit Facility and the Indenture, we may be required to apply the proceeds of the sale to repay any borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility or our 2025 Senior Notes. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, transition service agreements, guarantees, indemnities or other. 21. Table of Contents. current or contingent financial obligations. Under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside our control could affect our future financial results.. Capital projects may have lengthy deadlines during which market conditions may deteriorate between the capital expenditure's approval date and the conclusion of the project, negatively impacting projected returns. If we are unable to execute on our capital projects within their expected budget and timelines, or if the market conditions assumed in our projections deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.. Delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities or manufacturing lines could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted operating results. Project delays or budget overages may arise as a result of unpredictable events, which may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdenial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals, licenses and/or permits;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunanticipated increases in the cost of construction materials, labor, or utilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisruptions in transportation of components or construction materials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse weather conditions or natural disasters, equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnon-performance by, or disputes with, vendors, partners, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors.. Furthermore, presumed demand for the technologies or products provided by the manufacturing facilities or lines being constructed may deteriorate during the project period. If we were unable to stay within a project's overall timeline or budget, or if market conditions change, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. Production at our manufacturing facilities could be disrupted for a variety of reasons. Disruptions could expose us to significant losses or liabilities.. The hazards and risks of disruption associated with chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes exist in our operations and the operations of other occupants with whom we share manufacturing sites. These potential risks of disruption include, but are not necessarily limited to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texplosions and fires;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinclement or unusual weather and natural disasters, which may be aggravated by climate change;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tterrorist attacks;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure of mechanical, process safety and pollution control equipment;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailures or delays in properly implementing new technologies and processes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchemical spills and other discharge or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texposure to toxic chemicals.. These hazards could expose employees, customers, the community and others to toxic chemicals and other hazards, contaminate the environment, damage property, result in personal injury or death, lead to an interruption or suspension of operations, damage our reputation and adversely affect the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or us as a whole, and result in the need for remediation, governmental enforcement, regulatory shutdowns, the imposition of government fines and penalties, and claims brought by governmental entities or third parties. Legal claims and regulatory actions could subject us to both civil and criminal penalties, which could affect our product sales, reputation and profitability. Furthermore, the environmental, health and safety compliance, management systems, and emergency response and crisis management plans we have in place may not address or foresee all potential risks or causes of disruption.. If disruptions occur, alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production. Each of these scenarios could negatively affect our business and financial performance. If one of our key manufacturing facilities is unable to produce our products for an extended period of time, our sales may be reduced by the shortfall caused by the disruption and we may not be able to. 22. Table of Contents. meet our customers' needs, which could cause them to seek other suppliers. Furthermore, to the extent a production disruption occurs at a manufacturing facility that has been operating at or near full capacity, the resulting shortage of our product could be particularly harmful because production at the manufacturing facility may not be able to reach levels achieved prior to the disruption. Our insurance policies may not fully insure against all potential causes of disruption due to limitations and exclusions in those policies. Therefore, incidents that significantly disrupt our operations may expose us to significant losses and/or liabilities.. We are subject to customs, international trade, export control, and antitrust laws that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs.. We are subject to numerous regulations, including customs and international trade laws, export/import control laws, and associated regulations. These laws and regulations limit the countries in which we can do business; the persons or entities with whom we can do business; the products which we can buy or sell; and the terms under which we can do business, including anti-dumping restrictions. In addition, we are subject to antitrust laws and zoning and occupancy laws that regulate manufacturers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of our products, the operation of factories and warehouse facilities and our relationship with our customers, suppliers and competitors. If any of these laws or regulations were to change or were violated by our management, employees, suppliers, buying agents or trading companies, the costs of certain goods could increase, or we could experience delays in shipments of our goods, be subject to fines or penalties, or suffer reputational harm, which could reduce demand for our products and hurt our business and negatively impact results of operations. In addition, in some areas we benefit from certain trade protections, including anti-dumping protection and the EU's Authorized Economic Operator program, which provides expedited customs treatment for materials crossing national borders. If we were to lose these protections, our results of operations could be adversely affected.. Dow provides significant operating and other services, and certain raw materials used in the production of our products, under agreements that are important to our business. The failure of Dow to perform its obligations, or the termination of these agreements, could adversely affect our operations.. Prior to our inception, we were operated by Dow, which has provided and continues to provide services under certain agreements that are important to our business. We are a party to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe SAR MOSA, an outsourcing service agreement pursuant to which Dow provides certain administrative and business services to us for our operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe AR MOD5 agreement, an outsourcing service agreement pursuant to which Dow provides worldwide process control technology and related enterprise resource planning services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsupply and sales agreements pursuant to which Dow, among other things, provides us with raw materials, including ethylene, benzene, and butadiene; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tan operating services agreement pursuant to which Dow will operate and maintain certain of our facilities at Rheinmunster, Germany as well as employ and provide almost all of the staff for this facility.. Under the terms of the above agreements, either party is permitted to terminate the applicable agreement in a variety of situations, including in the event of the other party's uncured material breach, insolvency, change of control or cessation of operations. Should Dow fail to provide these services or raw materials, or should any of the above agreements be terminated, we would be forced to obtain these services and raw materials from third parties or provide them ourselves. Additionally, if Dow terminates agreements pursuant to which we are obligated to provide certain services, we may lose the fees received by us under these agreements. The failure of Dow to perform its obligations under, or the termination of, any of these contracts could adversely affect our operations and, depending on market conditions at the time of any such termination, we may not be able to enter into substitute arrangements in a timely manner, or on terms as favorable to us. For more information regarding our relationship with Dow, please see Item 1 - Business  -  Our Relationship with Dow.. Joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if we or our partners fail to fulfill our or their obligations, or differences in views among our joint venture partners result in delayed decisions, which may. 23. Table of Contents. adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures.. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we received dividends of $120.0 million from our Americas Styrenics joint venture. We may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. The nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties. If joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations, the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan. In that case, our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture. Differences in views among joint venture participants and our inability to unilaterally implement sales and production strategies or determine cash distributions from joint ventures may significantly impact short-term and longer term financial results, financial condition and the value of our ordinary shares.. Our current and future level of indebtedness of our subsidiaries could adversely affect our financial condition.. As of December 31, 2017, our indebtedness totaled approximately $1.2 billion. Additionally, as of December 31, 2017, the Company had $360.2 million (net of $14.8 million outstanding letters of credit) of funds available for borrowings under our 2022 Revolving Facility, as well as $122.1 million of funds available for borrowings under our Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including, but not limited to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreasing our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompromising our flexibility to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures, as compared to our competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tplacing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreasing our cost of borrowing.. Although the Senior Credit Facility and the Indenture governing our 2025 Senior Notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Also, we are not prevented from incurring obligations that do not constitute \"indebtedness\" as defined in the Senior Credit Facility or the Indenture, such as operating leases and trade payables. If new debt is added to our subsidiaries' current debt levels, the risks related to indebtedness that we now face could intensify.. In addition, a substantial portion of our subsidiaries' current indebtedness is secured by substantially all of our assets, which may make it more difficult to secure additional borrowings at reasonable costs. If we default or declare bankruptcy, after these obligations are met, there may not be sufficient funds or assets to satisfy our subordinate interests, including those of our shareholders. For more information regarding our indebtedness, please see Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations -  Capital Resources, Indebtedness and Liquidity.. The terms of our subsidiaries' indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to change or to take certain actions.. The Indenture and the Credit Agreement governing the Borrowers' Senior Credit Facility contain a number of covenants imposing certain restrictions on our subsidiaries' businesses. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of business opportunities. These agreements restrict, among other things, our subsidiaries' ability to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsell assets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur additional indebtedness;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpay dividends to Trinseo S.A.;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake investments or acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur liens;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trepurchase or redeem capital stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tengage in mergers or consolidations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmaterially alter the business they conduct;. 24. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tengage in transactions with affiliates; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconsolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of their assets.. The ability of our subsidiaries to comply with the covenants and financial ratios and tests contained in the Indenture and Credit Agreement, to pay interest on indebtedness, fund working capital, and make anticipated capital expenditures depends on our future performance, which is subject to general economic conditions and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our Senior Credit Facility to fund liquidity needs in an amount sufficient to enable them to service their indebtedness. Furthermore, if we need additional capital for general corporate purposes or to execute on an expansion strategy, there can be no assurance that this capital will be available on satisfactory terms or at all.. A failure to repay amounts owed under the Senior Credit Facility or 2025 Senior Notes at maturity would result in a default. In addition, a breach of any of the covenants in the Senior Credit Facility or Indenture governing our 2025 Senior Notes or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios or limits could result in a default. If a default occurs, lenders may refuse to lend us additional funds and the lenders or noteholders could declare all of the debt and any accrued interest and fees immediately due and payable. A default under one of our subsidiaries' debt agreements may trigger a cross-default under our other debt agreements. For more information regarding our indebtedness, please see Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations -  Capital Resources, Indebtedness and Liquidity.. We may be subject to losses due to liabilities or lawsuits related to contaminated land we own or operate or arising out of environmental damage or personal injuries associated with exposure to chemicals or the release of chemicals.. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA and similar statutes outside the U.S., the current or former owner or operator of a property contaminated by hazardous substance releases is subject to strict, unlimited, joint, several and retroactive liability for the investigation and remediation of the property, and also may be liable for natural resource damages associated with the releases. We also face the risk that individuals could seek damages for personal injury due to exposure to chemicals at our facilities, chemicals which have been released from our facilities, chemicals otherwise owned or controlled by us, or chemicals which allegedly migrated from products containing our materials. We may be subject to claims with respect to workplace exposure, workers' compensation and other health and safety matters. Legal claims and regulatory actions could subject us to both civil and criminal penalties, which could affect our reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.. There are several properties which we now own on which Dow has been conducting remediation to address historical contamination. Those properties include Allyn's Point, Connecticut; Dalton, Georgia; and Livorno, Italy. There are other properties with historical contamination that are owned by Dow that we lease for our operations, including our facility in Midland, Michigan. While we did not assume the liabilities associated with these properties in the U.S., because CERCLA and similar laws can impose liability for contamination on the current owner or operator of a property, even if it did not create the contamination, there is a possibility that a governmental authority or private party could seek to include us in an action or claim for remediation or damages, even though the contamination may have occurred prior to our ownership or occupancy. While Dow has agreed to indemnify us for liability for releases of hazardous materials that occurred prior to our separation from Dow, the indemnity is subject to monetary and temporal limitations, and we cannot be certain that Dow will fully honor the indemnity or that the indemnity will be sufficient to satisfy all claims that we may incur. In addition, we face the risk that future claims might fall partially or fully outside of the scope of the indemnity, particularly if there is a release of hazardous materials that occurs in the future or at any time after our separation from Dow or if the condition requiring remediation is attributable to a combination of events or operations occurring prior to and after our separation from Dow.. We are party to certain license agreements with Dow relating to intellectual property that is essential to our business. Because of this relationship, we may have limited ability to expand our use of certain intellectual property beyond the field of the license or to police infringement that may be harmful to our business.. In connection with the Acquisition, we acquired ownership of, or in some cases, a worldwide right and license to use, certain patents, patent applications and other intellectual property of Dow that were used by Dow to operate our. 25. Table of Contents. business segments or held by Dow primarily for the benefit of our business segments, prior to the Acquisition. Generally, we acquired ownership of the intellectual property that was primarily used in our business segments and acquired a license to a more limited set of intellectual property that had broader application within Dow beyond our core business segments. Our license from Dow is perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, and royalty-free. Furthermore, our license from Dow is exclusive within our business segments for certain patents and patent applications that were used by Dow primarily in the Styron business prior to the Acquisition, subject to licenses previously granted by Dow, and to certain retained rights of Dow, including Dow's retained right to use patents and patent applications outside of our business segments and for internal consumption by Dow. Our license from Dow relates to polymeric compositions, manufacturing processes and end applications for the polymeric compositions; and is limited to use in defined areas corresponding to our current business segments excluding certain products and end-use application technology retained by Dow. Our ability to develop, manufacture or sell products and technology outside of these defined areas may be impeded by the intellectual property rights that have been retained by Dow, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, infringement on these intellectual property rights could also impact our business and competitive position. We may not be able to enforce our rights, and Dow may be unwilling to enforce its rights, with respect to this intellectual property that has been licensed by Dow.. Regulatory and statutory changes applicable to our raw materials and products and our customers' products could require material expenditures, changes in our operations and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. Changes in environmental, health and safety regulations, in jurisdictions where we manufacture and sell our products, could lead to a decrease in demand for our products. In addition to changes in regulations, health and safety concerns could increase the costs incurred by our customers to use our products and otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to decreased demand for these products. Such a decrease in demand likely would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Materials such as acrylonitrile, ethylbenzene, styrene, butadiene, BPA and halogenated flame retardant are used in the manufacturing of our products and have come under scrutiny due to potentially significant or perceived health and safety concerns.. Additionally, these regulatory regimes currently require significant compliance expenditures by us, and changes applicable to our raw materials and products or our customers' products could require significant additional expenditures by us, or changes in our operations.. Our products are also used in a variety of end-uses that have specific regulatory requirements such as those relating to products that have contact with food or medical device end-uses. Our customers or distributors may not follow our policies and advice regarding the safe use and application of our products, which may unknowingly expose us to third-party claims. We and many of the applications for the products in the end markets in which we sell our products are regulated by various national and local rules, laws and regulations, such as the TSCA. Changes in regulations could result in additional compliance costs, seizures, confiscations, recall or monetary fines, any of which could prevent or inhibit the development, distribution and sale of our products. Changes in environmental and safety laws and regulations banning or restricting the use of these residual materials in our products, or our customers' products, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Failure to appropriately manage safety, human health, product liability and environmental risks associated with our products, product life cycles and production processes could adversely impact employees, communities, stakeholders, our reputation and the results of our operations.. Compliance with extensive and evolving environmental, health and safety laws may require substantial expenditures.. We use large quantities of hazardous substances, generate hazardous wastes and emit wastewater and air pollutants in our manufacturing operations. Consequently, our operations are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations at both the national and local level in multiple jurisdictions. Many of these laws and regulations have become more stringent over time and the costs of compliance with these requirements may increase, including costs associated with any capital investments for pollution control facilities. In addition, our production facilities and operations require operating permits, licenses or other approvals that may be subject to periodic renewal and, in circumstances of noncompliance, may be subject to revocation. The necessary licenses, permits or other approvals may not be issued or continue in effect, and any issued licenses, permits or approvals may contain more stringent limitations that restrict our operations or that require further expenditures to meet the permit requirements.. 26. Table of Contents. This continuing focus on climate change in jurisdictions in which we operate could result in new, potentially diverging or inconsistent, environmental regulations that may negatively affect us. This could cause us to incur additional costs in complying with any new regulations, which may adversely impact our operations and financial condition.  Compliance with more stringent environmental requirements would likely increase our costs of transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products, as well as the costs of storage and disposal of wastes. Additionally, we may incur substantial costs, including penalties, fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs for the failure to comply with these laws or permit requirements.. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly impact our results of operations and may significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.. Our operations are conducted by subsidiaries in many countries. The results of the operations and the financial position of these subsidiaries are reported in the relevant foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. The main currency to which we are exposed is the euro, noting that approximately 60% of our net sales were generated in Europe for the year ended December 31, 2017. To a lesser degree, we are also exposed to other currencies, including the Chinese yuan, Swiss franc, and Indonesian rupiah. The exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future. A depreciation of these currencies against the U.S. dollar, in particular the euro, will decrease the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts derived from these operations reported in our consolidated financial statements and an appreciation of these currencies will result in a corresponding increase in such amounts. Because some of our raw material costs are procured in U.S. dollars rather than on these currencies, depreciation of these currencies may have an adverse effect on our profit margins or our reported results of operations. Conversely, to the extent that we are required to pay for goods or services in foreign currencies, the appreciation of such currencies against the U.S. dollar will tend to negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, currency fluctuations may affect the comparability of our results of operations between financial periods.. We incur currency translation risk whenever we enter into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity. From time to time, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities, primarily accounts receivable, accounts payable and certain intercompany obligations. However, attempts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuation risk may be unsuccessful and result in an adverse impact to our operating results. Given the volatility of exchange rates, there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage our currency translation risks or that any volatility in currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.. If we are not able to continue the technological innovation and successful commercial introduction of new products, our customers may turn to other producers to meet their requirements.. Our industry and the end markets into which we sell our products experience periodic technological changes and ongoing product improvements. Our customers may introduce new generations of their own products or require new technological and increased performance specifications that would require us to develop customized products. Innovation or other changes in our customers' product performance requirements may also adversely affect the demand for our products. Our future growth will depend on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial and technological progress in all key end markets, and upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market products in such changing end markets. We need to continue to identify, develop and market innovative products on a timely basis to replace existing products in order to maintain our profit margins and our competitive position. We may not be successful in developing new products and technology that successfully compete with these materials, and our customers may not accept any of our new products. If we fail to keep pace with evolving technological innovations or fail to modify our products in response to our customers' needs, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of reduced sales of our products.. As a global business, we are exposed to local business risks in different countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.. We have significant operations worldwide, including manufacturing facilities, R&D facilities, sales personnel and customer support operations. As of December 31, 2017, we operated, or others operated on our behalf, 30 manufacturing plants (which include a total of 75 production units) at 23 sites around the world, including in Colombia, Germany, The. 27. Table of Contents. Netherlands, Belgium, Finland, Sweden, Italy, China, South Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan, and the United States. Our international operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries, including, but not necessarily limited to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnew and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictive labor and employment laws;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tuncertainties regarding interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvariation in political and economic policy of the local governments and social conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texport duties or import quotas;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdomestic and foreign customs and tariffs or other trade barriers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential staffing difficulties and labor disputes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmanaging and obtaining support and distribution for local operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased costs of transportation or shipping;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcredit risk and financial conditions of local customers and distributors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential difficulties in protecting intellectual property;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trisk of nationalization of private enterprises by foreign governments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential imposition of restrictions on investments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotentially adverse tax consequences, including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlegal restrictions on doing business in or with certain nations, certain parties and/or certain products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforeign currency exchange restrictions and fluctuations; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlocal economic, political and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and political instability.. We may not be successful in developing and implementing policies and strategies to address the foregoing factors in a timely and effective manner at each location where we do business. Consequently, the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or upon our financial condition and results of operations.. Our operations in developing markets could expose us to political, economic and regulatory risks that are greater than those we may face in established markets. For example, we operate in some nations that have experienced significant levels of governmental corruption. Any failure by us to ensure that our employees and agents comply with applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial civil and criminal penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct business in certain foreign jurisdictions or reputational damage, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.. Our business relies on intellectual property and other proprietary information and our failure to adequately protect or effectively enforce our rights could harm our competitive advantages with respect to the manufacturing of some of our products.. Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect, preserve and enforce our intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, licenses, trade secrets and other proprietary information of our business. However, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property and other proprietary information without our authorization or independently developing intellectual property and other proprietary information that is similar to or competes with ours. Any inability by us to effectively prevent the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and other proprietary information by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business or goodwill. If it becomes necessary for us to initiate litigation to protect our proprietary rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly, and we may not prevail.. We may be unable to determine when third parties are using our intellectual property rights without our authorization, particularly our manufacturing processes. In addition, we cannot be certain that any intellectual property rights that we have licensed to third parties are being used only as authorized by the applicable license agreement. The undetected, unremedied, or unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights or the legitimate development or acquisition of intellectual property that is similar to or competes with ours by third parties could reduce or eliminate the. 28. Table of Contents. competitive advantage we have as a result of our intellectual property, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary information, including our processes, apparatuses, technology, trade secrets, trade names and proprietary manufacturing know how, methods and compounds, through obtaining patent protection, securing trademark registrations and securing our trade secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements of appropriate scope and other means, our competitive advantages over other producers could be materially adversely affected. If we determine to take legal action to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights, any suits or proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and our management's attention. We may not prevail in any such suits or proceedings. A failure to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. Our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products.. Many of our competitors have a substantial amount of intellectual property that we must continually strive to avoid infringing as we improve our own business processes and develop new products and applications. Although it is our policy and intention not to infringe valid patents of which we are aware, we cannot provide assurances that our processes and products and other activities do not and will not infringe issued patents (whether present or future) or other intellectual property rights belonging to others. There nonetheless could be third-party patents that cover our products, processes or technologies, and it is possible that we could be liable for infringement of such patents and could be required to take remedial or curative actions to continue our manufacturing and sales activities with respect to one or more products that are found to be infringing. We may also be subject to indemnity claims by our business partners arising out of claims of their alleged infringement of the patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties in connection with their use of our products. Intellectual property litigation often is expensive and time-consuming, regardless of the merits of any claim, and our involvement in such litigation could divert our management's attention from operating our business. If we were to discover that any of our processes, technologies or products infringe on the valid intellectual property rights of others, we may not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms, or at all, or be able to modify our processes or technologies or re-engineer our products in a manner that is successful in avoiding infringement. Moreover, if we are sued for infringement and lose, we could be required to pay substantial damages and/or be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. Data security breaches could compromise sensitive information related to our business or the private information of our employees, vendors, and customers, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.. Cyberattacks or data security breaches could compromise confidential, private, business critical information or cause a failure in our computer or operating systems that may disrupt our operations. We have attractive information assets, including intellectual property, trade secrets and other sensitive, business critical information. We face an ever growing risk of attack from outside our organization (including attack by organized crime, so-called \"hacktivists,\" and state-sponsored actors) using sophisticated technical and non-technical methodologies (including social engineering and \"spear phishing\" attacks). We also face risks from internal threats to information security, such as from negligent or dishonest employees or consultants. A successful cyberattack or other breach of security could result in the loss of critical business information and/or could negatively impact operations, which could have a negative impact on our financial results. Furthermore, in addition to using our own systems and infrastructure, we use information systems and infrastructure operated by third-party service providers, including Dow. If our third-party service providers experience an information security breach, depending on the nature of the breach, it could compromise confidential, business critical information or cause a disruption in our operations. In addition, the loss or disclosure of sensitive or private information about our employees, vendors, or customers as a result of such a breach may result in violations of various data privacy. 29.

Therefore, any such disruptions to our operations or violations of data privacy laws could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations.. Risks Related to Our Ordinary Shares. We are a Luxembourg company and, as a result, shareholders may have difficulty effecting service of process or litigation against us or our officers and directors.. We are organized under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Many of our assets are located outside the United States and some of our directors and officers reside outside the United States and most of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, investors may find it more difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon us or these persons or to enforce outside the United States judgments obtained against us or these persons in U.S. courts, including judgments in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. Likewise, it may also be difficult for an investor to enforce in U.S. courts judgments obtained against us or these persons in courts located in jurisdictions outside the United States, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. It may also be difficult for an investor to bring an original action in a Luxembourg court predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us or these persons. Luxembourg law does not recognize a shareholder's right to bring a derivative action on behalf of a company.. Provisions in our organizational documents and Luxembourg law may deter takeover efforts or other actions that could be beneficial to shareholder value.. Our articles of association and Luxembourg law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions include a classified board of directors, the ability of the board of directors to approve a merger or other acquisition and to issue additional ordinary shares without shareholder approval that could be used to dilute a potential hostile acquirer. As a result, you may lose your ability to sell your ordinary shares for a price in excess of the prevailing market price due to these protective measures, and efforts by shareholders to change the direction or management of the company may be unsuccessful.. Pursuant to Luxembourg corporate law, existing shareholders are generally entitled to pre-emptive subscription rights in the event of capital increases and issues of shares against cash contributions. However, our board of directors is authorized to waive, limit or suppress such pre-emptive subscription rights until May 13, 2019. Furthermore, our shareholders may renew, expand or amend this authorization, which could result in the extension of the waiver beyond the initial five year period, at a future general meeting of shareholders."
