[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, which may affect our future financial performance. If any of the events or circumstances described below occurs, our business and financial performance could be harmed, our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline. The risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face. There may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may harm our business and financial performance. Because of the risks and uncertainties discussed below, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.. We have a history of net losses, may incur substantial net losses in the future and may not achieve and sustain profitability or growth in future periods.. We have incurred significant losses since inception, including a net loss of $97.6 million in 2017 and a net loss of $87.4 million in 2016.  As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $436.1 million.  While we conducted several restructurings during 2017 aimed at reducing our fixed costs and operating more efficiently, our costs may continue to rise as we implement additional initiatives designed to increase revenue, potentially including: investing more heavily in our existing titles as part of our product strategy; increasing our spending on user acquisition efforts, particularly for our growth titles; hiring additional staff in our San Francisco Bay Area and Hyderabad, India locations, including new creative leaders and their teams; developing new games with greater complexity, higher production values and deeper social features; running live operations on our games; and taking other steps to strengthen our company.  We anticipate that the costs of acquiring new players and otherwise marketing our new titles will continue to rise, particularly since advertising costs in our industry have generally been rising and we have encountered increasing difficulties in generating downloads of our games as users spend more time on alternative software applications, such as social media, messaging, and streaming applications. During 2017, we significantly increased our strategic investment in user acquisition for our Design Home title to leverage the game's momentum and maximize its revenue potential. While we. 17. Table of Contents. believe that we will more than recoup these marketing expenditures by generating additional revenues over the long term, our analysis may prove incorrect and we may not generate a positive return on investment from these expenditures. We may also continue to incur significant costs to acquire rights to third party intellectual property, including incurring significant minimum guaranteed royalty payments. If our revenue does not increase at a rate sufficient to offset these additional expenses, if the launch dates for our games are delayed, if we do not realize a sufficient return on our strategic investment in user acquisition for Design Home, if we experience unexpected significant increases in operating expenses or if we are required to take additional charges related to impairments or restructurings we will continue to incur losses. For example, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $27.3 million impairment related to certain contractual minimum guarantee payments made to certain of our celebrity licensors and other prepaid royalties. We have also taken restructuring charges in the past, including $6.0 million during 2017 related to headcount reductions and other restructuring activities. Furthermore, given the declines in overall downloads of mobile gaming applications and the significant amount of time and attention users are dedicating to social media and other non-gaming applications, increasing revenue has been, and may continue to be, challenging.  This industry trend has been negatively impacting us, as the number of downloads of sequels to certain of our most successful franchises, including the launches of Deer Hunter 2016 (which we have rebranded Deer Hunter 2018) and Eternity Warriors 4, as well as for our more recent titles, such as The Swift Life, Nicki Minaj: The Empire, Britney Spears: American Dream,  Restaurant Dash with Gordon Ramsay, and Rival Fire, have downloaded at significantly lower rates as compared to previous new titles.. If we fail to develop and publish new mobile games that achieve market acceptance, as well as continue to enhance our existing games, particularly our most successful games, our revenue would suffer.. Our business depends on developing and publishing mobile games that consumers will download and spend time and money playing.  We must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, technology, analytics and marketing to introduce new games and continue to update our successful evergreen and growth games, and we often must make decisions about these matters well in advance of a product's release to timely implement them.  Our success depends, in part, on unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, including consumer preferences and the number of applications they are willing to download to and maintain on their devices, competing gaming and non-gaming related applications, new mobile platforms and the availability of other entertainment activities.  If our games do not meet consumer expectations, or they are not brought to market in a timely and effective manner, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed. It can be difficult for us to predict with certainty when we will launch a new game as games may require longer development schedules or beta testing periods to meet our quality standards and our players' expectations. For example, we experienced delays in the development and commercial release of The Swift Life, and, following global launch, the title has not been commercially successful. If the new titles that we intend to release in 2018, including MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2018 and WWE Universe, also do not meet our expectations or if their worldwide commercial launch is delayed for any reason, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.  Even if our games are successfully introduced in a timely fashion and initially adopted, a failure to continually update them with compelling content or a subsequent shift in the entertainment preferences of consumers could cause a decline in our games' popularity that could materially reduce our revenue and harm our business, operating results and financial condition, which effect would be magnified for our most successful games and, in particular, Design Home.  It is difficult to predict when and how quickly the popularity and revenue of one of our games will decline.  In particular, in connection with our product strategy, we expect to commit more resources to updating, adding new features to and enhancing our existing titles as opposed to launching as many new titles as we have in prior years.  However, we may not be successful in updating our existing titles, such as was the case with our updates of Covet Fashion in the first quarter of 2017 and Racing Rivals in the fourth quarter of 2016 which were received poorly by some of our players and, in the case of Racing Rivals, resulted in decreased revenue. In addition, while we currently plan to add new features to Design Home, including language localization, an augmented reality mode, deeper game play and a richer social experience, our efforts may not result in increased revenues and could cause a decline in the game's popularity. If rates of revenue decline are higher than expected in a particular quarterly period, our new games are not launched in a timely manner or fail to download and/or monetize as we anticipate, the expenditures we make on user acquisition do not result in increased revenues, or the enhancements we make to existing titles do not result in increased revenues or decreased rates of revenue decline, we may not meet our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for a given quarter.  In addition, our Kim Kardashian: Hollywood game benefitted significantly from awareness of the game through media coverage and social media channels, and such viral success can be difficult to predict or to repeat in the future, or as in the case of Kendall & Kylie, may not translate into the level of sustained commercial success we experienced with Kim. 18. Table of Contents. Kardashian: Hollywood.  Furthermore, we compete for the discretionary spending of consumers, who face a vast array of entertainment choices, including social media and other non-gaming related apps, games played on personal computers and consoles, television, movies, sports and the Internet.  If we are unable to sustain sufficient interest in our games compared to other forms of entertainment, our business and financial results would be seriously harmed.. In addition to the market factors noted above, our ability to successfully develop games for mobile devices and their ability to achieve commercial success will depend on our ability to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tachieve a positive return on investment from our marketing and user acquisition efforts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tminimize launch delays and cost overruns on the development of new games;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teffectively monetize our games;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trelease games compatible with an increasingly diverse set of mobile devices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tminimize and quickly resolve bugs or outages; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacquire and successfully integrate high quality mobile game assets, personnel or companies.. These and other uncertainties make it difficult to know whether we will succeed in continuing to develop successful mobile games and launch these games in accordance with our operating plan. If we do not succeed in doing so, our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation will suffer.. Successfully developing and monetizing free-to-play games is a challenging business model.. We face significant challenges in achieving our goal of become the leading developer and publisher of free-to-play mobile games.  The most successful launches of free-to-play games tend to include socio-competitive gameplay, deep meta game features, player versus player activities, regularly updated content and other complex technological and creative attributes.  While we are working to include such features in our games through our growth and evergreen strategy, we may not successfully update our games to include these features or they may not be well received by our players.  For example, the significant update to Racing Rivals that we released in the fourth quarter of 2016 was poorly received by players and led to a significant decline in revenue from this title.    If we are unable to successfully implement our growth and evergreen strategy, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our financial performance and ability to grow revenue would be negatively affected, and we may be unable to launch successful new titles due to a diversion of talent and resources to our existing growth and evergreen titles. Additionally, our existing games compete with our new offerings and the offerings of our competitors, and revenue from our existing games have declined over time, a trend that we have limited experience reversing on a consistent basis.  Our efforts to develop new growth games and enhance our existing growth and evergreen titles may prove unsuccessful or, even if successful, it may take more time than we anticipate to achieve significant revenue because, among other reasons:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour strategy assumes that a large number of players will download our games because they are free and that we will then be able to effectively monetize the games; however, players may not widely download our games for a variety of reasons, including.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompetition for downloads not only with other mobile games but also with social media and other non-gaming related applications;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimits on the number of mobile applications players are willing to download to and maintain on their devices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpoor consumer reviews or other negative publicity;. 19. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tineffective or insufficient marketing efforts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlack of sufficient social and community features;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlack of prominent storefront featuring;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure to reach and maintain Top Free App Store rankings;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe relatively large file size of some of our games, which has been exacerbated due to Apple's requirement that games released on the Apple App Store include 64-bit support; in particular, our games often utilize a significant amount of the available memory on a user's device and tend to consume additional space as players advance through our games, which may cause players to delete our games once the file size grows beyond the capacity of their devices' storage limitations; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inherent limitations of the smartphone platforms and telecommunications networks, which at most only allow applications that are less than 150 megabytes to be downloaded over a carrier's wireless network; as a result, players must download our games that exceed 150 megabytes either via a wireless Internet (wifi) connection or initially to their computer and then side-load them to their device;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teven if our games are widely downloaded, we may fail to retain users or optimize the monetization of these games, such as has been the case with our Kendall & Kylie title, which may occur for a variety of reasons, including poor game design or quality, lack of socio-competitive features, gameplay issues such as game unavailability, long load times or an unexpected termination of the game due to data server or other technical issues, lack of differentiation from predecessor games or other competitive games, lack of innovative features that surprise and delight our players, differences in user demographics and purchasing power or our failure to effectively respond and adapt to changing user preferences through game updates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfuture licensed property games that we release may fail to resonate with consumers and may cost more to build than other titles due to the minimum guaranteed royalty payments to our licensors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe intend to continue to develop games based upon our own intellectual property, rather than celebrities or well-known licensed brands and properties, and we may encounter difficulties in generating sufficient consumer interest in and downloads of our original intellectual property games, particularly considering we have experienced significantly fewer downloads of more recent launches of game sequels as compared to their predecessors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmany well-funded public and private companies have released, or plan to release, free-to-play games, including titles in the home design category or games incorporating the same licensed brands that we intend to use in our games (e.g., WWE and Disney/Pixar), and this competition will make it more difficult for us to differentiate our games and derive significant revenue from them;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may have difficulty hiring proven creative leaders and the experienced monetization, live operations, server technology, user experience and product management personnel that we require to support our growth and evergreen gaming strategy, or may face difficulties in developing our technology platform and incorporating it into our products or developing unique gameplay;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe will depend on the proper and continued functioning of our own servers and third-party infrastructure to operate our connected games that are delivered as a service; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe impact of potential regulatory issues, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, has previously indicated that it intends to review issues related to in-app purchases, particularly with respect to games that are marketed primarily to minors (for. 20. Table of Contents. example, the FTC reached a settlement with Apple in January 2014 and with Google in September 2014 on this issue, and in April 2016, a federal court granted summary judgment in favor of the FTC finding Amazon liable for unfairly billing consumers for unauthorized in-app purchases by minors), and the FTC might issue rules significantly restricting or even prohibiting in-app purchases or name us as a defendant in a future class-action lawsuit;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvarious jurisdictions are assessing the legality of \"loot boxes,\" which are commonly used in some of our top games, and Apple has recently updated its terms of service to require publishers to publish the odds of winning the items contained in loot boxes, which could harm the monetization of our games that utilize loot boxes; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvarious legislators, administrative bodies and courts, primarily in Europe, have taken actions (including imposing fines) or may be considering taking actions (including antitrust enforcement) against Apple and Google, which are our primary distribution platforms, and Facebook, which is our primary user acquisition channel.. If we do not achieve a sufficient return on our investment with respect to our free-to-play business model, it will negatively affect our operating results and may require us to formulate a new business strategy.. We rely on a very small portion of our total players for nearly all of our revenue that we derive from in-app purchases.. We rely on a very small portion of our total players for nearly all of our revenue derived from in-app purchases (as opposed to advertisements and incentivized offers) and installation rates and user-growth have declined for us with many of our most recent product launches.  Since the launch of our first free-to-play titles in the fourth quarter of 2010, the percentage of unique paying players for our largest revenue-generating free-to-play games has typically been less than 2%, when measured as the number of unique paying users on a given day divided by the number of unique users on that day, though this percentage fluctuates, and it may be higher than 2% for some of our games during specific, relatively short time periods, such as immediately following worldwide launch or the week following content updates, marketing campaigns or certain other events.  To significantly increase our revenue, we must increase the number of downloads of our games, increase the number of players who convert into paying players by making in-app purchases or enrolling in subscriptions, increase the amount that our paying players spend in our games and/or increase the length of time our players generally play our games.  We might not succeed in our efforts to increase the monetization rates of our users, particularly if we do not increase the amount of social features in our games or otherwise succeed in our growth and evergreen gaming strategy.   We have also encountered difficulties in retaining our players as the average monthly active users, or MAU, for our games declined 20% from 35.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 28.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. If we are unable to convert non-paying players into paying players, or if we are unable to retain our paying players or if the average amount of revenue that we generate from our players does not increase or declines, our business may not grow, our financial results will suffer, and our stock price may decline.. We derive the majority of our revenue from Apple's App Store and the Google Play Store, and if we are unable to maintain a good relationship with each of Apple and Google or if either of these storefronts were unavailable for any prolonged period of time, our business will suffer.. The majority of our smartphone revenue has historically been derived from Apple's iOS platform, which accounted for 63.0% of our total revenue for 2017 compared with 62.4% and 60.5% of our total revenue for 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We generated the majority of this iOS-related revenue from the Apple App Store, which represented 54.2%, 52.7% and 51.7% of our total revenue 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with the significant majority of such revenue derived from in-app purchases. We generated the balance of our iOS-related revenue from offers and advertisements in games distributed on the Apple App Store and, to a far lesser extent, sales of premium games. In addition, we derived approximately 36.0%, 36.1%,  and 38.1% of our total revenue for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, from the Android platform. We generated the majority of our Android-related revenue from the Google Play Store, which represented 30.3%, 27.6% and 27.4%  of our total revenue for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with the significant majority of such revenue derived from in-app purchases. We believe that we have good relationships with each of Apple and Google, which have contributed to the majority of our games released in the last several years being featured on their. 21. Table of Contents. respective storefronts upon commercial release.  If we do not continue to receive prominent featuring, users may find it more difficult to discover our games and we may not generate significant revenue from them.  We may also be required to spend significantly more on marketing campaigns to generate substantial revenue on these platforms. For example, in the second half of 2016, Apple began displaying paid search advertisements for applications in the Apple App Store search results for the first time.  We have purchased, and may continue to purchase, such advertising to ensure the prominence of our games in the Apple App Store which could result in our marketing expenses increasing significantly. Additionally, our efforts to advertise through search advertisements in the Apple App Store may not be successful and may not result in additional users or monetization. In addition, currently neither Apple nor Google charge a publisher when it features one of their apps.  If either Apple or Google were to charge publishers to feature an app, it could cause our marketing expenses to increase considerably.  Accordingly, any change or deterioration in our relationship with Apple or Google could materially harm our business and likely cause our stock price to decline.. We also rely on the continued functioning of the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.  In the past these digital storefronts have been unavailable for short periods of time or experienced issues with their in-app purchasing functionality.  For example, on March 11, 2015, the Apple App Store experienced an approximately 12-hour global outage, which resulted in players and potential players of our games being unable to both download our games and make in-app purchases within our games during such outage.  If such events recur on a prolonged basis or other similar issues arise that impact our ability to generate revenue from these storefronts, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results.  In addition, if these storefront operators fail to provide high levels of service, our players' ability to access our games may be interrupted or players may not receive the virtual currency or goods for which they have paid, which may adversely affect our brand.. The operators of digital storefronts on which we publish our free-to-play games and the advertising channels through which we acquire some of our players in many cases have the unilateral ability to change and interpret the terms of our and others' contracts with them.. We distribute our free-to-play games through direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, for which the distribution terms and conditions are often \"click through\" agreements that we are not able to negotiate with the storefront operator.  For example, we are subject to each of Apple's and Google's standard click-through terms and conditions for application developers, which govern the promotion, distribution and operation of apps, including our games, on their storefronts.  Each of Apple and Google can unilaterally change its standard terms and conditions with no prior notice to us.  In addition, the agreement terms can be vague and subject to changing interpretations by the storefront operator.  Further, these storefront operators typically have the right to prohibit a developer from distributing its applications on its storefront if the developer violates its standard terms and conditions.  For example, in the fourth quarter of 2014, Apple informed developers that beginning on February 1, 2015 all new applications, and beginning June 1, 2015 all updates to existing applications, submitted to the Apple App Store must include 64-bit support.   Building our games to support 64-bit development has increased the file sizes of our games making it more difficult for players to download our games and potentially negatively impacting the number of downloads and active users of our titles, particularly for those games where we are unable to keep file sizes below 150 megabytes, which is the maximum file size that can currently be downloaded over any carrier's wireless network (requiring download over wifi networks). More recently, in the fourth quarter of 2017, Apple updated its terms of service to require publishers to disclose a player's odds of winning the various items contained within loot boxes.  Glu utilizes loot boxes in many of its current games and the games it intends to release in 2018, and it is possible that this new disclosure requirement will negatively impact the monetization of these titles. If Apple or Google, or any other key storefront operator, determines that we or one of our key vendors are violating its standard terms and conditions, by a new interpretation or otherwise, or prohibits us from distributing our games on its storefront, it would materially harm our business and likely cause our stock price to significantly decline.. In addition, in the first quarter of 2014, Facebook prohibited HasOffers, whose software development kit we had incorporated into our games to track advertising metrics, from participating in Facebook's mobile measurement program because Facebook asserted that HasOffers had violated its agreement with Facebook.  As a result, we removed HasOffers' software development kit from our games and replaced it with software from a new vendor, which did not adversely impact our revenue or operations. Any similar changes or prohibitions in the future, including any changes by Facebook of its advertising platform, which we rely on for a majority of our user acquisition activities, could negatively impact our revenue or otherwise materially harm our business, and we may not receive significant or any advance warning of such. 22. Table of Contents. changes.. Our financial results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict, which in turn could cause volatility in our stock price.. Our revenue and operating results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.  As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful.  In addition, we may not be able to accurately predict our future revenue or results of operations.   We base our current and future expense levels on our internal operating plans and sales forecasts, and our operating costs are to a large extent fixed.  As a result, we may not be able to reduce our costs sufficiently to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenue, and even a small shortfall in revenue could disproportionately and adversely affect financial results for that quarter.. In addition to other risk factors discussed in this section, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly results include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to increase the number of our paying players and the amount that each paying player spends in our games;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe popularity and monetization rates of our new games released during the quarter and the ability of games released in prior periods to sustain their popularity and monetization rates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe number and timing of new games released by us and our competitors, particularly those games that may represent a significant portion of revenue in a quarter, which timing can be impacted by internal development delays, longer than anticipated beta testing periods, shifts in product strategy and how quickly digital storefront operators review and approve our games for commercial release;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the prominence of storefront featuring for our games and those of our competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe loss of, or changes to, one of our distribution platforms;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges to the Apple iOS platform or the Google Android platform that we are not able to adapt to our game offerings;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in the size and rate of growth of overall consumer demand for smartphones, tablets, games and related content;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe amount and timing of charges related to any future impairments of goodwill, intangible assets, prepaid royalties and guarantees; for example, in 2017, we impaired $27.3 million related to contractual minimum guarantee royalty payments made to certain celebrity licensors and other prepaid royalties, and in future periods we may be required to impair our goodwill due to further declines in our business and/or stock price, or take additional large impairments related to contractual minimum guarantee commitments if the associated games we are developing are not successful;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the mix of revenue derived from games based on original intellectual property versus licensed intellectual property;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the mix of revenue derived from in-app purchases, advertisements and offers, which mix often depends on the nature of new titles launched during the quarter;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the mix of revenue derived from first party titles and third party titles, including revenue from Racing Rivals now that we have transitioned development for this title to Carbonated;. 23. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the amount of money we spend marketing our titles in a particular quarter, including the average amount we pay to acquire each new user, as well as changes in the timing of these marketing expenses within the quarter;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdecisions by us to incur additional expenses, such as increases in research and development, restructuring expenses, or unanticipated increases in vendor-related costs, such as hosting fees;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing of successful mobile device launches;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe seasonality of our industry;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in accounting rules, such as those governing recognition of revenue, including the period of time over which we recognize revenue for in-app purchases of virtual currency and goods within some of our games, as well as estimates of average playing periods and player life; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmacro-economic fluctuations in the United States and global economies, including those that impact discretionary consumer spending.. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do.. Developing, distributing and selling mobile games is a highly competitive business, characterized by frequent product introductions and rapidly emerging new platforms, technologies and storefronts.  For players, we compete primarily on the basis of game quality, brand and customer reviews.  We compete for space on user's smartphones and tablet devices in terms of the number of applications on their device and the amount of storage consumed by such applications.  We also compete more generally for the time and attention of users of smartphones and tablet devices who are spending ever-increasing amounts of time on social media, messaging and music, movie and television streaming applications. We compete for promotional and digital storefront placement based on our relationship with the digital storefront owner, historical performance, game quality, perception of sales potential, customer reviews and relationships with celebrities and other licensors of brands and other content.  For content licensors, we compete based on royalty and other economic terms, historical financial performance of prior licensed content titles, perceptions of development quality, speed of execution, distribution breadth and relationships with storefront owners.  We also compete for experienced and talented employees, which competition we expect to encounter as we execute on our strategy to hire creative leaders that have a proven track record of success.. We compete with a continually increasing number of companies, including Activision (the parent company of King Digital Entertainment), DeNA, Disney, Electronic Arts (EA Mobile), Gameloft, Gamevil, GREE, GungHo Online Entertainment, Netease, Netmarble, Nexon, Nintendo, Rovio, Warner Brothers, and Zynga and many well-funded private companies, including DoubleDown, Jam City, Machine Zone, Miniclip, Niantic, Playrix, Pocket Gems, Scopely, Storm 8/Team Lava, and Supercell.  We also face competition from online game developers and distributors who are primarily focused on specific international markets.  We could also face increased competition if those companies choose to compete more directly in the United States or the other markets that are significant to us or if large companies with significant online presences such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft or Verizon, choose to enter or expand in the games space or develop competing games.  In addition, we also face competition from mobile applications and websites focused on the home design market, which may include games, e-commerce titles, design applications and others seeking to displace our Design Home title which is a leading title in the currently unsaturated home design application market. Competitors in this space include, or may include, established game developers, established real estate companies, interior design companies, e-commerce companies and other well-funded private companies looking to enter the home design market. We also compete for downloads and time spent on mobile devices with companies that develop popular social media and messaging applications, such as Facebook (with its Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp and other applications), Pinterest, Reddit, Snapchat, Twitter, Vevo and YouTube, companies that develop streaming music, movie and television applications, such as Pandora, Spotify, Tidal, HBO Go, Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu, and with companies that create non-gaming related software applications for celebrities.. 24. Table of Contents. In addition, given the open nature of the development and distribution for smartphones and tablets and the relatively low barriers to entry, we also compete or will compete with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch games and other content for these devices using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise.  As an example of the competition that we face, it has been estimated that more than 3.2 million applications, including more than 800,000 active games, were available on Apple's U.S. App Store as of February 28, 2018.  The proliferation of titles in these open developer channels makes it difficult for us to differentiate ourselves from other developers and to compete for players without substantially increasing our marketing expenses and development costs.. Some of our competitors and our potential competitors have one or more advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, which include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsignificantly greater financial resources;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgreater experience with free-to-play games, building and maintaining growth or evergreen titles, and building social and community features into mobile games, as well as more effective game monetization;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstronger brand and consumer recognition regionally or worldwide;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and non-mobile products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlarger installed user bases from their existing mobile games;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlarger installed user bases from related platforms, such as console gaming or social networking websites, to which they can market and sell mobile games;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmore substantial intellectual property of their own from which they can develop games without having to pay royalties;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlower labor and development costs and better overall economies of scale;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgreater platform-specific focus, experience and expertise;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbroader global distribution and presence; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgreater talent, both in overall headcount and in terms of experience in creating successful titles.. If we are unable to compete effectively or we are not as successful as our competitors in our target markets, our sales could decline, our margins could decline and we could lose market share, any of which would materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.. Our players may decide to select competing forms of entertainment instead of playing our games.. We also face competition for the leisure time, attention and discretionary spending of our players.  Other forms of leisure time activities, such as social media and messaging applications, personal computer and console games, television, movies, sports, and the Internet, are generally much larger and more well-established options for consumers.  In addition, competition for the attention of players on their mobile devices is intense, as the number of apps on mobile devices is increasing dramatically.  In particular, non-gaming applications for mobile devices, such as social media and messaging, music, movie and television streaming, and dating applications, have become increasingly popular, making it more difficult for mobile games to generate the same level of consumer interest and number of downloads as in prior periods.  In addition, Kim Kardashian West, Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner have launched their own personal media applications, and those applications, or similar applications launched by these celebrity partners could compete with our. 25. Table of Contents. titles that feature such celebrities for the time, attention and spending of our players.  If our players do not find our games to be compelling or if other leisure time activities are perceived by our players to offer greater variety, affordability, interactivity and overall enjoyment, our business could be materially and adversely affected.. Securing license agreements to develop, publish and market games based on or significantly incorporating celebrities, third-party licensed brands, properties, and other content typically requires that we make minimum guaranteed royalty and other payments to such licensors, and to the extent such payments become impaired, our operating results would be harmed.. In connection with partnerships with celebrities and other licensors of third-party brands, properties and content, we have incurred and may continue to incur significant minimum guaranteed royalty and other payments.  As a result, we may incur impairments on such payments if our forecasts for these games are lower than we anticipated at the time we entered into the agreements.  For example, in 2017, we impaired $27.3 million related to contractual minimum guaranteed royalty payments made to certain of our celebrity licensors and other prepaid royalties; as of December 31, 2017 we had remaining prepaid royalty balances totaling $12.3 million.  We expect to continue to selectively license third-party licensed brands, properties and other content and to pay minimum guaranteed royalty payments in connection with such deals.  As a result, we may be required to take impairments in future periods if the games we are developing that have significant contractual minimum guarantee commitments associated with them are not successful.. If we do not successfully establish and maintain awareness of our brand and games, if we fail to develop high-quality, engaging games that are differentiated from our prior games, if we incur excessive expenses promoting and maintaining our brand or our games or if our games contain defects or objectionable content, our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.. We believe that establishing and maintaining our brand is critical to establishing a direct relationship with players who purchase our products from direct-to-consumer channels and to maintaining our existing relationships with distributors and content licensors, as well as potentially developing new such relationships.  Increasing awareness of our brand and recognition of our games is particularly important in connection with our strategic focus of developing games based on our own intellectual property.  Our ability to promote the Glu brand and increase recognition of our games depends on our ability to develop high-quality, engaging games, including integrating the level of social and community features appropriate for a game's target audience and partnering with brands with fan bases that can support successful mobile games.  If consumers, digital storefront owners and branded content owners do not perceive our existing games as high-quality or if we introduce new games that are not favorably received by them, then we may not succeed in building brand recognition and brand loyalty in the marketplace. In addition, globalizing and extending our brand and recognition of our games is costly and involves extensive management time to execute successfully.  Although we make significant sales and marketing expenditures in connection with the launch of our games, these efforts may not succeed in increasing awareness of our brand or the new games.  If we fail to increase and maintain brand awareness and consumer recognition of our games, our potential revenue could be limited, our costs could increase and our business, operating results and financial condition could suffer.. In addition, if a game contains objectionable content, we could experience damage to our reputation and brand.  Our games may contain violence or other content that some consumers may find objectionable.  For example, Apple has assigned each of our shooter games a 17-and-older rating due to its violence.  In addition, Google required us to submit two versions of our Blood & Glory and Contract Killer:  Zombies games, one of which did not depict blood.  Despite these ratings and precautions, consumers may be offended by some of our game content and children to whom these games are not targeted may choose to play them without parental permission nonetheless.  In addition, our employees or employees of outside developers could include hidden features in our games without our knowledge, which might contain profanity, graphic violence, sexually explicit or otherwise objectionable material.  Users of our games, particularly games with social messaging features, may utilize these features for illegal purposes or target certain users through these features. If consumers believe that a game we published contains objectionable content or may expose them to nefarious individuals, it could harm our brand, consumers could refuse to download it or demand a refund for any in-app purchases, and could pressure the digital storefront operators to no longer allow us to publish the game on their platforms.  Similarly, if any of our games are introduced with defects or have playability issues, we may receive negative user reviews and our brand may be damaged. For example, our Racing Rivals title experienced playability and user interface issues after the release of an update in the fourth quarter of 2016 that introduced new graphics, which particularly affected users of some Android. 26. Table of Contents. devices and harmed monetization of the game. These issues could be exacerbated if our customer service department does not timely and adequately address issues that our players have encountered with our games.. We have depended on a small number of games for a significant portion of our revenue in recent fiscal periods.  If these games do not succeed or we do not release highly successful new games, our revenue would decline.. In the mobile gaming industry, new games are frequently introduced, but a relatively small number of games account for a significant portion of industry sales.  Similarly, a significant portion of our revenue comes from a limited number of games, although the games in that group have shifted over time. Our top three titles for 2017, Design Home, MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2017 and Covet Fashion, each accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue in 2017 and collectively generated approximately 48.7% of our revenue during the year, while our top four titles for 2016, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood,  Cooking Dash, Tap Sports Baseball 2016 and Racing Rivals, each accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue in 2016 and collectively generated approximately 56.8% of our revenue during the year; no other game generated more than 10% of our revenue during these respective years. We expect our dependency on a small number of games for a majority of our revenue will continue for the foreseeable future as we implement measures to make our successful games into growth or evergreen titles and plan to release fewer titles in 2018 than we have in past years. In particular, our growth title Design  Home has accounted for a successively larger percentage of our quarterly revenues since its launch which has increased our reliance on the success of this title. Our evergreen titles strategy is one where we hope to reduce period over period declines in revenue from our existing successful titles and position ourselves to convert these into growth titles that grow revenue on a year over year basis. While we experienced some success with this strategy during 2017, in particular for Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, we may not consistently succeed in implementing or executing on it, which could cause our revenue to decline in 2018. In addition, revenue from Kim Kardashian: Hollywood is in part tied to the continued popularity of Kim Kardashian West and her marketing efforts through social media and other channels, and we have little to no control over these matters and they are hard for us to predict.  Accordingly, we must continue to launch new games that generate significant revenue to continue to grow revenue in the future, which we have sometimes failed to do.  For example, celebrity titles that we launched in 2015 through 2017 featuring Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj, Britney Spears and Katy Perry all failed to generate meaningful revenue, and revenue from our Kendall & Kylie title declined significantly from its peak level following global launch in February 2016.  In addition, sequels to some of our most successful game franchises have failed to download and monetize at the levels of predecessor versions, and we have experienced disappointing results from several games based on film franchises, including our James Bond: World of Espionage game.  Failure to differentiate, innovate and otherwise improve our games and game franchises would lead to revenue declines.. We rely on a combination of our own servers and technology and third party infrastructure to operate our games. If we experience any system or network failures, unexpected technical problems, cyber attacks or any other interruption to our games, it could reduce our sales, increase costs, or result in a loss of revenue or loss of end users of our games.. We rely on digital storefronts and other third-party networks to deliver games to our players and on their or other third parties' billing systems to track and account for our game downloads.  We also rely on our own servers and third-party infrastructure to operate our connected games, and we expect that our reliance on such third-party infrastructure and our technology platform will increase as we continue to add additional social features and functionality into our games.  In particular, a significant portion of our game traffic is hosted by Amazon Web Services, which service provides server redundancy and uses multiple locations on various distinct power grids.  Amazon may terminate its agreement with us upon 30 days' notice.  In addition, Amazon has experienced brief power outages on occasion during the past several years that have affected the availability of certain of our games during such outages. While none of these events adversely impacted our business, a similar outage of a longer duration could.  In addition, the operation of our online-only games depends on the continued functionality of our technology platform.  As a result, we could experience unexpected technical problems with regard to the operation of our online-only games, particularly if the number of concurrent users playing our games is significantly more than we anticipate.  Any technical problem with, cyber attack on, or loss of access to these third parties' or our systems, servers or other technologies, including our technology platform, could result in the inability of end users to download or play our games, cause interruption to gameplay, prevent the completion of billing for a game or result in the loss of users' virtual currency or other in-app purchases, interfere with access to some aspects of our games or result in the theft of end-user personal information.  For example, in the second quarter of 2017, we experienced technical issues with our Covet Fashion title that caused an extended outage and resulted in certain users receiving in-. 27. Table of Contents. game currency erroneously. If users are unable to access and play our games for any period of time, if virtual assets are lost, or if users do not receive their purchased virtual currency, we may receive negative publicity and game ratings, we may lose players of our games, we may be required to issue refunds, and we may become subject to regulatory investigation or class action litigation, any of which would negatively affect our business.  Any of these problems could require us to incur substantial repair costs, distract management from operating our business and result in a loss of revenue.. Cyber attacks, security breaches, and computer viruses could harm our business, reputation, brand and operating results.. Cyber attacks, security breaches, and computer viruses have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future. We store sensitive information, including personal information about our employees.  In addition, our games involve the storage and transmission of players' personal information in our facilities and on our equipment, networks and corporate systems run by us or managed by third-parties including Apple, Google, and Facebook.   Security breaches of our systems or the systems of third-parties on which we rely could expose us to litigation, remediation costs, increased costs for security measures, loss of revenue, damage to our reputation and potential liability.  Our player data, corporate systems, third-party systems and security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, a combination of these, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data, our employees' data, our players' data or our advertisers' data. In addition, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees to disclose information in order to gain access to our data, our employees' data, our players' data or our advertisers' data. We were the victim of a cyber attack in early November 2014, when an animal rights group took down our main website and user forums, and in January 2016 another cyber attack caused us to take down our user forums for nearly a week. In May 2016, one of our employees fell victim to a spear phishing attack in which the employee uploaded sensitive employee information to a third party website. In October 2013, we were also the victim of a \"CryptoLocker\" ransomware attack that temporarily prevented our access to sensitive company files.  Although these incidents did not result in a material loss of revenue, any future incidents, particularly of longer duration, could damage our brand and reputation and result in a material loss of revenue.  Given the global nature of our business and the low cost, relative ease and proliferation of internet enabled devices, we may be at increased risk for cyber attacks and, specifically, denial of service attacks, such as the denial of service attacks that affected Dyn in October 2016. In addition, as highlighted by reports that ISIS terrorists may have used Sony's PlayStation 4 network to plan attacks, the chat and other social features in our games could potentially be used by terrorist organizations or other criminals to communicate or for other nefarious purposes, which could severely damage our brand and reputation.  If an actual or perceived security breach occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose players and advertisers, and we could suffer significant legal and financial harm due to such events or in connection with remediation efforts and costs, investigation costs or penalties, litigation, regulatory and enforcement actions, changed security and system protection measures. Any of these actions could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of investigating, remediating, eliminating and putting in place additional information technology tools and devices designed to prevent actual or perceived security breaches, as well as the costs to comply with any notification obligations resulting from such a breach, could have a significant impact on our financial and operating results.. We use a game development engine licensed from Unity Technologies to create many of our games. If we experience any prolonged technical issues with this engine or if we lose access to this engine for any reason, it could delay our game development efforts and cause our financial results to fall below expectations for a quarterly or annual period, which would likely cause our stock price to decline.. We use a game development engine licensed from Unity Technologies to create many of our games, and we expect to continue to use this engine for the foreseeable future.  Because we do not own this engine, we do not control its operation or maintenance nor do we control how the engine is updated or upgraded.  As a result, any prolonged technical issues with this engine might not be resolved quickly, despite the fact that we have contractual service level commitments from Unity.  In addition, to the extent that we require any functionality that is not offered by Unity, as was the case when Apple initially announced its 64-bit requirement, we are dependent on Unity to update or upgrade its engine to offer such functionality.  Furthermore, although Unity cannot terminate our agreement absent an uncured material breach of the. 28. Table of Contents. agreement by us, we could lose access to this engine under certain circumstances, such as a natural disaster that impacts Unity or a bankruptcy event.  If we experience any prolonged issues with the operation of the Unity game development engine, if the Unity game development engine does not offer the functionality we require or if we lose access to this engine for any reason, it could delay our game development efforts and cause us to not meet revenue expectations for a quarterly or annual period, which would likely cause our stock price to decline.  For example, in the first quarter of 2016, we were unable to implement a significant update to our Racing Rivals title due to programming bugs in the Unity game development engine, which update we believe could have helped to increase revenue for that title during the quarter.  Further, if one of our competitors acquired Unity, the acquiring company would be less likely to renew our agreement, which expires in October 2019, which could impact our game development efforts in the future, particularly with respect to sequels to games that were created on the Unity engine.. We derive a significant portion of our revenue from advertisements and offers that are incorporated into our free-to-play games through relationships with third parties. If we lose the ability to provide these advertisements and offers for any reason, if we become victim to advertising fraud or if any events occur that negatively impact the revenue we receive from these sources, it would negatively impact our operating results.. We derive revenue from our free-to-play games through in-app purchases, advertisements and offers. We incorporate advertisements and offers into our games by implementing third parties' software development kits.  We rely on these third parties to provide us with a sufficient inventory of advertisements and offers to meet the demand of our user base.  If we exhaust the available inventory of these third parties, it will negatively impact our revenue.  If our relationship with any of these third parties terminates for any reason, or if the commercial terms of our relationships do not continue to be renewed on favorable terms, we would need to locate and implement other third party solutions, which could negatively impact our revenue, at least in the short term.  In addition, we may be susceptible to various types of advertising fraud, which could reduce the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or cause us to pay money to advertising firms for installations that were wrongly attributed to such firms.  While we have implemented measures to detect and prevent advertising fraud, such measures may not prove effective, which would harm our user acquisition efforts and could harm our revenues.  Furthermore, the revenue that we derive from advertisements and offers is subject to seasonality, as companies' advertising budgets are generally highest during the fourth quarter and decline significantly in the first quarter of the following year, which negatively impacts our revenue in the first quarter (and conversely tends to significantly increase our marketing expenses in the fourth quarter).. The actions of the storefront operators can also negatively impact the revenue that we generate from advertisements and offers.  For example, in the second quarter of 2011, Apple began prohibiting virtual currency-incented advertising offers in games that directed users to download other applications from the Apple App Store in order to complete the offer.  These offers accounted for approximately one-third of our revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2011, and our inability to use such offers has negatively impacted our revenue.  In addition, during the second quarter of 2014, there were reports that Apple was considering prohibiting certain types of virtual currency-incented video advertising in games that promoted other applications available on the Apple App Store.  These incented video advertisements generate a meaningful percentage of our overall revenue, and any prohibition of these advertisements would have had a negative impact on our revenue.  Any similar changes in the future that impact our revenue that we generate from advertisements and offers could materially harm our business.. We rely on assumptions and estimates to calculate certain of our key metrics, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.. Certain of our key metrics, including the number of our daily and monthly active users, our average revenue per daily user and the average useful life of our paying players, is calculated using internal company data from multiple analytics systems that have not been independently verified. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable calculations for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring these metrics across our large user base around the world.  We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy, but these efforts may not prove successful and we may discover material inaccuracies.  In addition, our methodology for calculating these metrics may differ from the methodology used by other companies to calculate similar metrics.  For example, we currently treat an individual who plays two different Glu games on the same day or who plays the same game on two different devices during the same day (e.g., iPhone and an iPad) as. 29. Table of Contents. two active users for each such day when we average or aggregate active users over time. As such, the calculations of our active users may not precisely reflect the actual number of people using our titles. We may also discover unexpected errors in our internal data that resulted from technical or other errors.  Furthermore, our Crowdstar studio utilizes a separate analytics system from the rest of our company, which could result in internal inconsistencies or errors.  If we determine that any of our metrics are not accurate, we may be required to revise or cease reporting such metrics and it may harm our reputation and business.. We may not, or may be unable to, renew our existing content licenses when they expire and may not choose to obtain additional licenses or be able to obtain new licenses on favorable terms, which could negatively impact our revenue if we fail to replace such revenue with revenue from games based on our own intellectual property.. Although we generated 93.3% of our revenue from games based on our own intellectual property during 2013, that percentage declined to 62.7% in 2014, 42.1% in 2015 and 39.7% in 2016, largely due to the majority of our revenue being generated from games that are based on or substantially incorporate third-party intellectual property, such as Kim Kardashian: Hollywood,  Kendall & Kylie,  Racing Rivals, the Tap Sports Baseball franchise and Restaurant Dash with Gordon Ramsay. While our revenue from our own intellectual property increased to 59.1% during 2017, we still expect to continue to derive significant revenue from titles incorporating third-party intellectual property, such as the Tap Sports Baseball franchise and WWE Universe, and expect to continue to develop new titles featuring third-party intellectual property, such as in connection with our recently announced relationship with Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media  through which we expect to release a title in 2019. Certain of our licenses expire at various times during the next several years, and we may be unable to renew these licenses on terms favorable to us or at all, and we may have difficulties obtaining licenses from new content owners on terms acceptable to us, if at all.  In addition, these licensors could decide to license to our competitors or develop and publish their own mobile games, competing with us in the marketplace.  We also license certain brands and their assets for our Covet Fashion and Design Home titles without the provision of a license fee or royalty. These licensors could decide to no longer license their assets under the current terms, and to instead charge a one-time payment, ongoing royalty or both, which may adversely affect the profitability of these titles. Failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses or to obtain additional licenses would prevent us from continuing to offer our current licensed games and introducing new mobile games based on such licensed content, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.. We publish games developed by third parties, which exposes us to a number of potential operational and legal risks.. Publishing games developed by third parties exposes us to a number of potential operational and legal risks.  For example, we may be required to provide third party developers with upfront license fees or non-recoupable minimum guaranteed royalties in order to obtain the rights to publish their games, and we may incur significant costs marketing these games after they have been commercially launched.  For example, we agreed to significant license fee and minimum guaranteed royalty payments to an affiliate of Tencent to license and publish Tencent's WeFire game in the United States and international markets outside of Asia under the title Rival Fire. Due to Rival Fire's poor performance in terms of downloads and monetization since its launch in July 2016, we impaired $14.5 million in 2016 related to these payments.  Other third-party games that we license and publish may not be commercially successful, particularly if they fail to appeal to Western audiences, and may not generate the amount of revenue necessary for us to fully recoup minimum guaranteed royalty and license fee payments.  We and other mobile gaming companies have failed in the past to achieve commercial success in bringing successful games developed and launched in Asia to Western markets, including with respect to our efforts to publish and monetize Rival Fire. In addition, if any of the games created by third party developers with which we work infringe intellectual property owned by others, or otherwise violate any third party's rights or any applicable laws and regulations, such as laws with respect to data collection and privacy, we would be exposed to potential legal risks by publishing these games.. Our business and growth may suffer if we are unable to hire and retain key personnel.. Our future success will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to attract, retain and motivate our key personnel, namely our management team, creative leaders and experienced game development personnel.  In particular, we experienced a change in our management team in November 2016 which included the appointment of Nick Earl as our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Earl is critical to our vision, strategic direction, products and technology and. 30. Table of Contents. the continued retention of the other members of our senior management team is important to our continued development. In addition, to grow our business, execute on our business strategy and replace departing employees, we must identify, hire and retain qualified personnel, particularly creative leaders and additional game development teams to support our new product launches and monetization, live operations, server technology, user experience and product management personnel to support our growth and evergreen games.  Attracting and retaining proven creative leaders is difficult in a competitive hiring market.  We are actively seeking to hire additional creative leaders, but we may not be able to attract these new creative leaders or retain our existing creative leaders. The gaming and technology industries are also traditionally male dominated, so it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain talented female personnel who may be needed to help us optimize our games that are targeted to a more female-focused audience, including our games in the home dcor, fashion and time management genres.  Volatility of our stock price, changes in our compensation structure for our executive officers that relies on performance linked stock awards, the lack of success of some of our recent product launches such as The Swift Life and recent headcount reductions may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain top talent.  Competition for qualified management, game development and other staff is intense, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area where we are headquartered.  In addition, attracting and retaining qualified personnel may be particularly difficult for us if our stock price remains at current levels or declines in the future, since individuals may elect to seek employment with other companies that they believe have better long-term prospects or that present better opportunities for earning equity-based compensation.  Competitors have in the past and may in the future attempt to recruit our employees, and our management and key employees are not bound by agreements that could prevent them from terminating their employment at any time.  As we continue to develop expertise in free-to-play mobile gaming and building and maintaining growth and evergreen titles, our competitors may increasingly seek to recruit our employees, particularly from our development studios.  In addition, we do not maintain a key-person life insurance policy on any of our officers.  Our business and growth may suffer if we are unable to hire and retain key personnel.. Any restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives that we undertake may not deliver the results we expect, and these actions may adversely affect our business.. During the last several years we have implemented restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives to streamline operations and improve cost efficiencies.  Our most recent restructurings included reductions in personnel in Bellevue, Washington; San Francisco, California; Long Beach, California; Portland, Oregon; and Beijing, China, as well as the divestiture of our Moscow, Russia game development studio.   Our most recent restructurings and divestiture and other such efforts could result in disruptions to our operations and adversely affect our business.  For example, in connection with the divestiture of our Moscow studio, we are in the process of transitioning certain titles that were developed or operated by the Moscow studio, including Deer Hunter 2018, to our Hyderabad, India studio.  If this transition is not successfully executed, it could result in a decline in revenues from these titles. In addition, we cannot be sure that the cost reduction and streamlining initiatives will be as successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect or that additional costs will not offset any such reductions or streamlining.  If our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses, our operating results will suffer.. We may not realize the benefits expected through our strategic relationship with Tencent and other aspects of the relationship could have adverse effects on our business.. In April 2015, we entered into a strategic relationship with Tencent, a leading Internet company in China and arguably the world's largest gaming company.  Tencent, through a controlled affiliate, agreed to invest $126.0 million in exchange for approximately 16.3% of our total outstanding common stock on a post-transaction basis.  In November 2015, we entered into an agreement with an affiliate of Tencent to license and publish its game, WeFire, in the United States and international markets outside of Asia under the name Rival Fire, which we launched in July 2016. In light of the poor performance of the title in terms of monetization and downloads, and the related contractual prepaid royalty commitments and license fees under our agreement with the affiliate of Tencent, we impaired $14.5 million in the third quarter of 2016.  In addition, we may not succeed in entering into any other agreements or operating partnerships with Tencent in the future.  Even if we do enter into additional operational partnerships, it could take months to years to fully realize the benefits of such partnerships and, to the extent such agreements involve publishing our games in China, some of our platform partners in China and other parts of Asia may view such a partnership negatively, and in fact, some partners in China may already view the fact that Tencent is a significant investor in us negatively, and we may find it more difficult to obtain featuring of our games from such partners in China going forward.. 31. Table of Contents. Tencent, through its controlled affiliates, held approximately 20.3% of the aggregate voting power of our common stock as of December 31, 2017, and could acquire up to 25.0% of the voting power through open-market purchases of our common stock. While Tencent has agreed to cause these shares to be voted with the majority recommendation of the independent members of our board of directors on most matters, Tencent could have considerable influence over matters such as approving a potential acquisition of us.  Tencent was also granted the right to designate a member of our board of directors, initially appointing Tencent Senior Vice President, Steven Ma, and in January 2017 appointing Ben Feder, Tencent's President of International Partnerships (North America), as Mr. Ma's replacement on our board of directors. Mr. Feder or any future Tencent designee could have an actual or apparent conflict of interest in such matters.  Tencent's investment in and position with us could also discourage others from pursuing any potential acquisition of us, which could have the effect of depriving the holders of our common stock of the opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over the prevailing market price.. Our reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves.. Our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting policies promulgated by the SEC and accounting standards bodies and the methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies.  The frequency of accounting policy changes may accelerate, including conversion to unified international accounting standards.  Policies affecting revenue recognition have affected, and could further significantly affect, the way we account for revenue.  For example, the accounting for revenue derived from smartphone platforms and free-to-play games, particularly with regard to revenue generated from online digital storefronts, is still evolving and, in some cases, uncertain.  In particular, we were required to file an amendment to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 to restate or revise the financial statements contained in those reports (including for the year ended December 31, 2011) because we did not correctly apply the applicable revenue recognition accounting guidance relating to our smartphone revenue.  While we believe that we are now correctly accounting for our smartphone revenue, this is an area that continues to involve significant discussion among accounting professionals and which is not completely settled.  It is possible that the relative application, interpretation and weighting of the factors that relate to whether we should be considered the principal in the sales transaction of games sold through digital storefronts may evolve, and we may in the future conclude that our new accounting policy for smartphone revenue, as reflected in the restated financial statements, is incorrect, which could result in another restatement of affected financial statements.  In addition, we currently defer revenue related to virtual goods and currency over the average playing period of paying users, which approximates the estimated weighted average useful life of the transaction.  While we believe our estimates are reasonable based on available game player information, we may revise such estimates in the future as our games' operation periods change.  Any adjustments arising from changes in the estimates of the lives of these virtual items would be applied to the current quarter and prospectively on the basis that such changes are caused by new information indicating a change in the game player behavior patterns of our paying users.  Any changes in our estimates of useful lives of these virtual items may result in our revenue being recognized on a basis different from prior periods' and may cause our operating results to fluctuate.  As we enhance, expand and diversify our business and product offerings, the application of existing or future financial accounting standards, particularly those relating to the way we account for our smartphone revenue, could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows.. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.. Maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements.  In connection with the restatement of our financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2013, management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, reassessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012.  Based on this reassessment using the guidelines established in Internal Control  -  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 1992, management had concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 because of a material weakness related to the application of revenue accounting guidance to our smartphone revenue for sales through digital storefronts.  This control deficiency resulted in. 32. Table of Contents. the misstatement of our revenue and cost of revenue, including gross margin percentages, and the related balance sheet accounts and financial disclosures for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012 (and the restatement of unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, June 30, and September 30 for such years).  Although we have remediated this material weakness, if we are otherwise unable to maintain adequate internal controls for financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls as required pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, it could result in another material misstatement of our financial statements that would require a restatement, investor confidence in the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reports may be impacted or the market price of our common stock could be negatively impacted.. Conversion of key internal systems and processes, particularly our ERP system, and problems with the design or implementation of these systems and processes could interfere with, and therefore harm, our business and operations.. We recently underwent a multi-phase project to convert certain key internal systems and processes, including our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system to a cloud based system. In connection with the transition to our new ERP system, we shutdown certain of our legacy ERP systems in the third quarter of 2016, which affected certain of our processes in the second half of 2016 and may continue to impact our processes. While we have transitioned to our new ERP system, we may need to resolve issues that arise in connection with this transition. We have invested, and will continue to invest, significant capital and human resources in the design and implementation of these systems and processes. Any problems in the functioning of the new systems or processes, particularly any that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability to process payments, record and transfer information in a timely and accurate manner, recognize revenue, file SEC reports in a timely manner, or otherwise run our business. Even if we encounter these adverse effects, as noted above, the design and implementation of these new systems and processes may be more time consuming than we anticipated and could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. Our business will suffer if our acquisition and strategic investment activities are unsuccessful or disrupt our ongoing business, which may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions.. We have acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, companies, products and technologies that complement our strategic direction.  Acquisitions and investments involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiversion of management's time and a shift of focus from operating the business to issues related to negotiation of acquisition or investment terms, integration and administration;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to successfully integrate acquired technologies and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential employee morale and retention issues resulting from any reductions in compensation, or changes in management, reporting relationships, or future prospects;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential product development delays resulting from any changes and disruptions that may follow the acquisition;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsignificant competition from other acquirors and investors as the gaming industry consolidates and challenges in offering attractive consideration given the volatility of our stock price and potential difficulties in obtaining alternative financing;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchallenges retaining the key employees, customers and other business partners of the acquired or investee business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to realize synergies expected to result from an acquisition or strategic investment;. 33. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tan impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets or investments in future periods would result in a charge to earnings in the period in which the write-down occurs, such as the case with each of the charges we took in the second and third quarters of 2016 for our investments in Plain Vanilla;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe internal control environment of an acquired or investee entity may not be consistent with our standards and may require significant time and resources to improve;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tin the case of foreign acquisitions or strategic investments, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tliability for activities of the acquired or investee companies before the acquisition or investment, including violations of laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, intellectual property and other litigation claims or disputes, accounting standards and other known and unknown liabilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tharm to our brand and reputation; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tharm to our existing business relationships with business partners and advertisers as a result of the acquisition.. In particular, we acquired Crowdstar in the fourth quarter of 2016 in a multi-step transaction that did not involve the cooperation of Crowdstar's management, where the former Chief Executive Officer of Crowdstar did not continue with the company post-acquisition and where we did not receive customary representations, warranties or indemnities from the acquired company.  While the integration of Crowdstar into our company has to date proceeded relatively smoothly and Crowdstar's top titles, Covet Fashion and Design Home, are generating significant revenue, we still face risks and uncertainties in connection with this acquisition.  For example, we may not be able to retain key Crowdstar employees for a variety of reasons, including the fact that we intend to relocate the Crowdstar team from Burlingame, California to our new San Francisco headquarters, and the loss of key Crowdstar employees could affect revenue derived from Covet Fashion and Design Home.   In addition, we continue to face other risks related to the Crowdstar acquisition, including the risk of unknown liabilities or claims arising or being asserted.. In addition, if we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition or strategic investment, as we did for our acquisitions of Griptonite, Inc., Blammo Games Inc., GameSpy Industries, Inc., PlayFirst, Inc. and Cie Games, Inc., our current stockholders' percentage ownership and earnings per share would be diluted.  We may also need to raise additional capital in the event we use a significant amount of cash as consideration in an acquisition. Because acquisitions and strategic investments are inherently risky, our transactions may not be successful and may, in some cases, harm our operating results or financial condition.. Changes in foreign exchange rates and limitations on the convertibility of foreign currencies could adversely affect our business and operating results.. We currently transact business in more than 100 countries and in dozens of different currencies, with the Euro, Canadian Dollar and Indian Rupee being the primary international currencies in which we transact business.  Conducting business in currencies other than U.S. Dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative impact on our reported operating results.  We experienced significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates in 2016 and 2017, and expect to experience continued significant fluctuations in the future.  We incur expenses for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our non-U.S. locations in the local currency, and an increasing percentage of our international revenue is from customers who pay us in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.  Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and those other currencies could result in the U.S. Dollar equivalent of these expenses being higher and/or the U.S. Dollar equivalent of the foreign-denominated revenue being lower than would be the case if exchange rates were stable.  This could negatively impact our operating results. To date, we have not engaged in exchange rate hedging activities, and we do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future.. 34. Table of Contents. We face added business, political, regulatory, operational, financial and economic risks as a result of our international operations and distribution, any of which could increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results.. International sales represented approximately 24.5%, 25.7%, and 31.3% of our revenue during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  To target international markets, we develop games that are customized for consumers in those markets.  We have international offices located in Canada and India. We expect to increase our international presence, as we intend to increase the number of our employees in our Hyderabad, India office. Risks affecting our international operations include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to develop games that appeal to the tastes and preferences of consumers in international markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmultiple and conflicting laws and regulations, including complications due to unexpected changes in these laws and regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to develop, customize and localize games that appeal to the tastes and preferences of consumers in international markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompetition from local game developers that have significant market share in certain foreign markets and a better understanding of local consumer preferences;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting improper payments to government officials or representatives of commercial partners;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulations that could potentially affect the content of our products and their distribution, particularly in China where multiple governmental bodies must review and approve of any gaming application before it may be published;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforeign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating income earned in countries outside the United States;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential adverse foreign tax consequences, since due to our international operations, we must pay income tax in numerous foreign jurisdictions with complex and evolving tax laws;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical, economic and social instability, including the ongoing hostilities in Syria and the Crimea region;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions on the export or import of technology;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttrade and tariff restrictions and variations in tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights in certain countries.. These risks could harm our international operations, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.. We may also liquidate or cease operating some of our foreign subsidiaries in the future which may raise additional risks. For example, we are in the process of winding down and liquidating certain of our subsidiaries in China and Japan.  These liquidation efforts will require us to obtain approvals from various government agencies in China and Japan, which could impose taxes and penalties upon us related to such liquidations.. If we fail to deliver our games at the same time as new mobile devices are commercially introduced, our revenue may. 35. Table of Contents. suffer.. Our business depends, in part, on the commercial introduction of new mobile devices with enhanced features, including larger, higher resolution color screens, improved audio quality, and greater processing power, memory, battery life and storage.  For example, the introduction of new and more powerful versions of Apple's iPhone and iPad and devices based on Google's Android operating system, have helped drive the growth of the mobile games market.  In addition, consumers generally purchase the majority of content, such as our games, for a new device within a few months of purchasing it.  We do not control the timing of these device launches.  The mobile games market could also be disrupted by new technologies, such as the introduction of next generation virtual reality devices.  Some manufacturers give us access to their new devices prior to commercial release.  If one or more major manufacturers were to stop providing us access to new device models prior to commercial release, we might be unable to introduce games that are compatible with the new device when the device is first commercially released, and we might be unable to make compatible games for a substantial period following the device release.  If we do not adequately build into our title plan the demand for games for a particular mobile device or experience game launch delays, we miss the opportunity to sell games when new mobile devices are shipped or our end users upgrade to a new mobile device, our revenue would likely decline and our business, operating results and financial condition would likely suffer.. If the use of smartphones and tablet devices as game platforms and the proliferation of mobile devices generally do not increase, our business could be adversely affected.. While the number of people using mobile Internet-enabled devices, such as smartphones and tablet devices, has increased dramatically in the past few years, the mobile market, particularly the market for mobile games, is still emerging, and it may not grow as we anticipate. Our future success is substantially dependent upon the continued growth of use of mobile devices for games, as opposed to social media applications or other uses.  The proliferation of mobile devices may not continue to develop at historical rates and consumers may not continue to use mobile Internet-enabled devices as platforms for games.  We believe that historic rates of adoption and download of new applications in the United States will not continue to rise, and will instead decline, as the U.S. mobile application market enters a mature state. In addition, new and emerging technologies could make the mobile devices on which our games are currently released obsolete, requiring us to transition our business model to develop games for other next-generation platforms.. Changes to digital platforms' rules relating to \"loot boxes,\" or the potential adoption of regulations or legislation impacting loot boxes, could require us to make changes to some of our games' economies or design, which could negatively impact the monetization of these games and harm our revenues.. In December 2017, Apple updated its terms of service to require publishers of applications that include \"loot boxes\" to disclose the odds of receiving each type of item within the loot box to customers prior to purchase. Loot boxes are a commonly used monetization technique in free-to-play mobile games in which a player can acquire a virtual loot box, typically through game play or by using virtual currency, but the player does not know which virtual item he or she will receive (which may be a common, rare or super rare item, and may be a duplicate of an item the player already has in his or her inventory) until the loot box is opened.  The player will always receive one or more virtual items when he or she opens the loot box, but the player does not know exactly which item(s) until the loot box is opened. We utilize loot boxes in some of our top games including our Tap Sports Baseball franchise, Kim Kardashian Hollywood and Racing Rivals, and we intend to use loot boxes in our upcoming WWE Universe title. We are in the process of complying with Apple's new rules relating to loot boxes and do not currently believe that they will have a material impact on the monetization of our games that utilize loot boxes.  However, in the event that Apple changes its terms of service to include more onerous requirements or if Apple (or Google) were to prohibit the use of loot boxes in games distributed on its digital platform, it would require us to redesign the economies of the affected games and would likely cause our revenues generated from these games to decline.  In addition, various jurisdictions, including Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the states of Hawaii and Washington, are reviewing or have indicated that they intend to review the legality of loot boxes and whether they constitute gambling.  To the extent that one or more jurisdictions determine that loot boxes constitute gambling or they otherwise elect to regulate the use of loot boxes, it could require us to stop utilizing loot boxes within our games that are distributed in such territories, which would negatively impact our revenues.. 36. Table of Contents. Our business is subject to increasing governmental regulation. If we do not successfully respond to these regulations, our business may suffer.. We are subject to a number of domestic and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business.  Not only are these laws constantly evolving, which could result in their being interpreted in ways that could harm our business, but legislation is also continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution.  In the United States, for example, numerous federal and state laws have been introduced which attempt to restrict the content or distribution of games.  Legislation has been adopted in several states, and proposed at the federal level, that prohibits the sale of certain games to minors.  If such legislation is adopted, it could harm our business by limiting the games we are able to offer to our customers or by limiting the size of the potential market for our games.  We may also be required to modify certain games or alter our marketing strategies to comply with new and possibly inconsistent regulations, which could be costly or delay the release of our games.  For example, the United Kingdom's Office of Fair Trading issued principles in 2014 relating to in-app purchases in free-to-play games that are directed towards children 16 and under.  In addition, in response to a request made by the European Commission, Google no longer labels free-to-play games as free in European Union countries.  Similarly, in the fourth quarter of 2014, Apple changed its label for free-to-download applications from \"FREE\" to \"GET\" in the Apple App Store.  The FTC has also indicated that it intends to review issues related to in-app purchases, particularly with respect to games that are marketed primarily to minors; the FTC reached settlement agreements with Apple and Google on this subject and won a lawsuit against Amazon on this subject.  If the FTC issues rules significantly restricting or even prohibiting in-app purchases, it would significantly impact our business strategy.  In addition, two self-regulatory bodies in the United States (the Entertainment Software Rating Board) and in the European Union (Pan European Game Information (PEGI)) provide consumers with rating information on various products such as entertainment software similar to our products based on the content (for example, violence, sexually explicit content, language).  Furthermore, the Chinese government has adopted measures designed to eliminate violent or obscene content in games, along with regulations that may require us to obtain approval from certain government agencies in China, including the Ministry of Culture and General Administration of Press and Publication, in order to continue to publish any of our games in China.  Any one or more of these factors could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers, by limiting the size of the potential market for our products, or by requiring costly additional differentiation between products for different territories to address varying regulations.. Furthermore, the growth and development of free-to-play gaming and the sale of virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours.  We anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of our industry will increase and that we will be required to devote legal and other resources to addressing such regulation.  For example, existing laws or new laws regarding the regulation of currency and banking institutions may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or goods.  If that were to occur we may be required to seek licenses, authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators, the granting of which may depend on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight, all of which could significantly increase our operating costs.  Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States or elsewhere regarding these activities may dampen the growth of free-to-play gaming and impair our business.. We sometimes offer our players various types of sweepstakes, giveaways and promotional opportunities, and launched a version of our Frontline Commando: D-Day game utilizing the Skillz technology platform that allowed players to compete against each other in tournaments for cash prizes.  We have also in the past through a partnership with Probability PLC offered a suite of Glu branded mobile slots games in the United Kingdom and might continue to explore opportunities with respect to real money gambling.  We are subject to laws in a number of jurisdictions concerning the operation and offering of such activities and games, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business.  Any court ruling or other governmental action that imposes liability on providers of online services could result in criminal or civil liability and could harm our business.. In addition, because our services are available worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions and others may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, including in jurisdictions where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure.. The laws and regulations concerning data privacy and data security are continually evolving, and our actual or. 37. Table of Contents. perceived failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business.. We are subject to federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and the protection of the information that we collect regarding our users, which laws are currently in a state of flux and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.  The U.S. government, including the FTC and the Department of Commerce, is continuing to review the need for greater regulation over collecting information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet and on mobile devices.  For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which will become effective in May 2018, creates new individual privacy rights and imposes worldwide obligations on companies handling personal data, which has resulted in a greater compliance burden for us and other companies with European users and could result in us incurring substantial monetary penalties if we are found to be in violation of these regulations. Various U.S. state and federal regulators have also continued to expand the scope of data elements worthy of, and subject to, privacy protections, creating a multi-layered regulation regime that may be applicable to our business and will require time and resources to address.  Additionally, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act requires companies to obtain parental consent before collecting personal information from children under the age of 13. In January 2014, the FTC announced a settlement with Apple related to in-app purchases made by minors.  In April 2016, the FTC was also successful in a lawsuit against Amazon, with a Federal District Court granting summary judgment in favor of the FTC, finding Amazon liable for unfairly billing consumers for unauthorized in-app purchases by minors.  If we do not follow existing laws and regulations, as well as the rules of the smartphone platform operators, with respect to privacy-related matters, or if consumers raise any concerns about our privacy practices, even if unfounded, it could damage our reputation and operating results.. All of our games are subject to our privacy policy and our terms of service located on our corporate website.  If we fail to comply with our posted privacy policy, terms of service or privacy-related laws and regulations, including with respect to the information we collect from users of our games, it could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business.  In addition, interpreting and applying data protection laws to the mobile gaming industry is often unclear.  These laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state, country to country, or region to region, and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices.  Complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices.  Further, if we fail to adequately protect our users' privacy and data, it could result in a loss of player confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of users, which could adversely affect our business.. In the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California's Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement.  Costs to comply with these laws may increase as a result of changes in interpretation.  Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.  The security measures we have in place to protect our data and the personal information of our employees, customers and partners could be breached due to cyber-attacks initiated by third party hackers, employee error or malfeasance, fraudulent inducement of our employees to disclose sensitive information or otherwise.  Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.  Any breach or unauthorized access could materially interfere with our operations or our ability to offer our services or result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our data, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.. Some of our players may make sales or purchases of virtual goods used in our games through unauthorized or fraudulent third-party websites, which may reduce our revenue.. Virtual goods in our games have no monetary value outside of our games. Nonetheless, some of our players may make sales and/or purchases of our virtual goods, such as virtual currency for our Tap Sports Baseball games or cars for our Racing Rivals game, through unauthorized third-party sellers in exchange for real currency. These unauthorized or fraudulent transactions are usually arranged on third-party websites and the virtual goods offered may have been obtained through unauthorized means such as exploiting vulnerabilities in our games, from scamming our players with fake offers for virtual goods or other game benefits, or from credit card fraud. We do not generate any revenue from these. 38. Table of Contents. transactions. These unauthorized purchases and sales from third-party sellers could reduce our revenues by, among other things:.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tdecreasing revenue from authorized transactions;.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tcreating downward pressure on the prices we charge players for our virtual currency;.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tincreasing chargebacks from unauthorized credit card transactions;.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tcausing us to lose revenue from dissatisfied players who stop playing a particular game;.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tincreasing costs we incur to develop technological measures to curtail unauthorized transactions;.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tresulting in negative publicity or harm our reputation with players and partners; and.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tincreasing customer support costs to respond to dissatisfied players.. To discourage unauthorized purchases and sales of our virtual goods, we state in our terms of service that the buying or selling of virtual currency and virtual goods from unauthorized third party sellers may result in bans from our games or legal action. We have banned players as a result of such activities. We have also employed technological measures to help detect unauthorized transactions and continue to develop additional methods and processes by which we can identify unauthorized transactions and block such transactions. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts to prevent or minimize these unauthorized or fraudulent transactions will be successful.. Our stock price has fluctuated and declined significantly since our initial public offering in March 2007, and may continue to fluctuate, may not rise and may decline further.. The trading price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is expected to continue to fluctuate in the future, as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control, such as changes in the operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular, such as Activision, Electronic Arts and Zynga.  We also experience stock price volatility as investors monitor the performance of our games through third-party tools, such as App Annie and other measurements of the performance of our games.. In addition, The Nasdaq Global Select Market on which our common stock is listed has in the past experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many companies, some of which appear to be unrelated or disproportionate to their operating performance.  These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company.  Securities class action litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources.. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property rights, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and improperly use our intellectual property and our business and operating results may be harmed.. Our intellectual property is essential to our business.  We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights.  To date, we have only six issued U.S. patents and eleven U.S. patent applications currently outstanding, including two that we inherited through acquisitions, so we will not be able to protect the majority of our technologies from independent invention by third parties.  In addition, we have filed foreign patent applications on two of the issued U.S. patents.  Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or. 39. Table of Contents. otherwise to obtain and use our technology and games, and some parties have distributed \"jail broken\" versions of our games where all of the content has been unlocked and made available for free.  Further, some of our competitors have released games that are nearly identical to successful games released by their competitors in an effort to confuse the market and divert users from the competitor's game to the copycat game.  We believe that these tactics were employed by Hothead Games in their game Kill Shot, which we believed infringed certain Glu copyrights and trade dress contained in our Deer Hunter Classic game.  We initiated litigation against Hothead Games in November 2014, and we entered into a settlement agreement with Hothead in August 2015 in which Hothead agreed to make payments to us, including ongoing payments, and we agreed to allow Hothead to continue to publish the Kill Shot game.  To the extent competitors continue to copy our games, it could reduce the amount of revenue we are able to generate from any infringed games.  Monitoring unauthorized use of our games is difficult and costly, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent piracy and other unauthorized distribution and use of our technology and games, particularly in certain international jurisdictions, such as China, where the laws may not protect our intellectual property rights as fully as in the United States.  In the future, we may institute additional litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention and our resources.. In addition, although we require our third-party developers to sign agreements not to disclose or improperly use our trade secrets, to acknowledge that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf are our property and to assign to us any ownership they may have in those works, it may still be possible for third parties to obtain and improperly use our intellectual properties without our consent.  This could harm our brand, business, operating results and financial condition.. We may become involved in intellectual property disputes, which may disrupt our business and require us to pay significant damage awards.. Third parties may sue us for intellectual property infringement, or initiate proceedings to invalidate our intellectual property, which, if successful, could disrupt our business, cause us to pay significant damage awards or require us to pay licensing fees.  For example, on August 20, 2014, Inventor Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that we were infringing one of its patents and seeking unspecified damages, including interest, costs, expenses and an accounting of all infringing acts, attorneys' fees and such other costs as the Court deems just and proper.  In September 2015, the Court granted our motion to dismiss the case brought by Inventor Holdings.  In addition, in November 2014, Telinit Technologies, LLC, a Texas company, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division, alleging that we were infringing one of its patents and seeking unspecified damages, attorneys' fees and costs.  We settled the dispute with Telinit for an immaterial amount in January 2015.  Finally, in November 2015, Just Games Interactive LLC (d/b/a Kung Fu Factory, f/k/a Tiny Fun Studios), or Just Games, filed a complaint against us and Kristen Jenner (f/k/a Kris Kardashian) in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.  The complaint alleged direct copyright infringement against us and seeking at least $10.0 million in damages as well as other relief, including costs, permanent and temporary injunctive relief, an accounting of profits, a constructive trust and such other costs the Court deemed just and proper.  We filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on January 27, 2016.  On February 1, 2016, Just Games filed a voluntary motion to dismiss their case against us without prejudice. Despite our prior successes in defending against such claims, claims against us in the future could result in our being enjoined from using our intellectual property or licensed intellectual property, and we might incur significant licensing fees and could be forced to develop alternative technologies.  We may also be required to pay penalties, judgments, royalties or significant settlement costs.  If we fail or are unable to develop non-infringing technology or games or to license the infringed or similar technology or games on a timely basis, we may be forced to withdraw games from the market or be prevented from introducing new games.  We might also incur substantial expenses in defending against third-party claims, regardless of their merit.. In addition, we use open source software in some of our games and expect to continue to use open source software in the future.  We may face claims from companies that incorporate open source software into their products, claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the source code, the open source software and/or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license.  These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our games, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and operating results.. 40. Table of Contents. We may become a party to litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.. We may become subject to various legal proceedings, claims and regulatory inquiries that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims and inquiries may arise in the future.  In addition, events may occur that give rise to a potential risk of litigation.  The number and significance of regulatory inquiries have increased as our business has grown and evolved.  Any proceedings, claims or inquiries initiated by or against us, whether successful or not, may be time consuming; result in costly litigation, damage awards, consent decrees, injunctive relief or increased costs of doing business, require us to change our business practices or products, require significant amounts of management time, result in diversion of significant operations resources or otherwise harm our business and future financial results.. \"Cheating\" programs, scam offers, black-markets and other offerings or actions by unrelated third parties that seek to exploit our games and players affect the game-playing experience and may lead players to stop playing our games or divert revenue to unrelated third parties.. Unrelated third parties have developed, and may continue to develop, \"cheating\" programs, scam offers, black-markets and other offerings that may decrease our revenue generated from our virtual economies, divert our players from our games or otherwise harm us.  Cheating programs enable players to exploit vulnerabilities in our games to obtain virtual currency or other items that would otherwise generate in-app purchases for us, play the games in automated ways or obtain unfair advantages over other players who do play fairly.  Unrelated third parties attempt to scam our players with fake offers for virtual goods or other game benefits.  We devote resources to discover and disable these programs and activities, but if we are unable to do so in a prompt and timely manner, our operations may be disrupted, our reputation damaged and players may play our games less frequently or stop playing our games altogether.  This may lead to lost revenue from paying players, increased cost of developing technological measures to combat these programs and activities, legal claims relating to the diminution in value of our virtual currency and goods, and increased customer service costs needed to respond to disgruntled players.. Unanticipated changes in our income tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities may affect our future financial results.. Our future effective income tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Determining our worldwide provision for income taxes requires significant judgments. The estimation process and applicable laws are inherently uncertain, and our estimates are not binding on tax authorities.  Our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control.  Recent and contemplated changes to U.S. tax laws, including limitations on a taxpayer's ability to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and defer certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the United States are repatriated to the United States, could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. Further, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, including our transfer pricing, or determine that the manner in which we operate our business is not consistent with the manner in which we report our income to the jurisdictions, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. Foreign tax authorities may also interpret or change tax regulations such that we may be subject to tax liabilities upon closure or liquidation of a foreign subsidiary. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine if our provision for income taxes is adequate. These continuous examinations may result in unforeseen tax-related liabilities, which may harm our future financial results.. We must charge, collect and/or pay taxes other than income taxes, such as payroll, value-added, sales and use, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and foreign jurisdiction.  If tax authorities assert that we have taxable nexus in a jurisdiction, they may seek to impose past as well as future tax liability and/or penalties.  Any such impositions could also cause significant administrative burdens and decrease our future sales.  Moreover, state and federal legislatures have been considering various initiatives that could change our tax position regarding sales and use taxes.. 41. Table of Contents. Finally, as we change our international operations, adopt new products and new distribution models, implement changes to our operating structure or undertake intercompany transactions in light of changing tax laws, our tax expense could increase.. Our facilities are located near known earthquake fault zones, and the occurrence of an earthquake or other natural disaster could damage our facilities and equipment, which could require us to curtail or cease operations.. Our principal offices are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, an area known for earthquakes.  We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including power loss, fires, explosions, floods, communications failures, terrorist attacks and similar events.  If any natural or other disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business could be impaired.. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research about our business, or publish negative or misinformed reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline and/or become more volatile.. The trading market for our common stock is affected by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about our business.  We do not have any control over these analysts.  If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or lower their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline.  If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.  In addition, our share price and the volatility of our shares can be affected by misinformed or mistaken research reports on our business.. Our common stock price may be affected by third-party data regarding our games.. Third parties publish daily data about us and other mobile gaming companies with respect to downloads of our games, daily and monthly active users and estimated revenue generated by our games.  These metrics can be volatile, particularly for specific games, and in many cases do not accurately reflect the actual levels of usage of our games across all platforms or the revenue generated by our games.  To the extent that securities analysts or investors base their views of our business or prospects on such third-party data, the price of our common stock may be affected by such third party data and may not reflect the actual performance of our business.. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales might occur, could reduce the price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us.. The market price of shares of our common stock could decline as a result of substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors and their affiliates, executive officers, employees and significant stockholders, under our current shelf registration statements, through a large number of shares of our common stock becoming available for sale, or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares.  For example, Tencent is free to sell the 21,000,000 shares it acquired from us in the second quarter of 2015 on the open-market, subject only to our black-out periods and other limitations under our insider trading policy.. Some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law, may deter third parties from seeking to acquire us.. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors, including the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tonly our chairman of the board, our lead independent director, our Chief Executive Officer, our president or a majority of our board of directors is authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;. 42. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour stockholders are able to take action only at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tonly our board of directors and not our stockholders is able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before a meeting of stockholders.. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents certain stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding common stock not held by such 15% or greater stockholder, although our board of directors waived this provision with respect to Tencent's potential acquisition of greater than 15% of our shares in connection with the transaction in which we initially sold shares of our common stock to an affiliate of Tencent.. We have no plans to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not have any plans to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments."
