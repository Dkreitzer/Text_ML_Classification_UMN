[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Cautionary Statement As To Forward-Looking Information. This report includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact are “forward-looking statements” for purposes of federal and state securities laws, including any projections of earnings, cash flows, revenue or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations; any statements concerning proposed new services or developments; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; future growth rates in the markets we serve; increases in foreign sales; supply and cost of raw materials, any statements of belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements may include the words “may,” “estimate,” “intend,” “continue,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology.. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in any of our forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in any of our forward-looking statements. Our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to change and to inherent risks and uncertainties, such as those disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Factors that could cause our actual results, performance and achievements or industry results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:. <U+25CF>Weaknesses                                          and cyclicality in any of the industries in which our customers operate;. <U+25CF>Changes                                          in marketing, product pricing and sales strategies or developments of new products by                                          us or our competitors;. <U+25CF>Future reductions in U.S. governmental spending or changes in governmental programs, particularly military equipment procurement programs;. <U+25CF>Our                                          ability to obtain and retain product approvals;. <U+25CF>Supply                                          and costs of raw materials, particularly steel, and energy resources and our ability                                          to pass through these costs on a timely basis;. <U+25CF>Our                                          ability to acquire and integrate complementary businesses;. <U+25CF>Unanticipated                                          liabilities of acquired businesses;. <U+25CF>Unexpected                                          equipment failures, catastrophic events or capacity constraints;. <U+25CF>The                                          costs of defending, or the results of, new litigation;. <U+25CF>Our                                          ability to attract and retain our management team and other highly-skilled personnel;. <U+25CF>Increases                                          in interest rates;. <U+25CF>Work                                          stoppages and other labor problems for us and our customers or suppliers;. <U+25CF>Limitations                                          on our ability to expand our business;. <U+25CF>Regulatory                                          changes or developments in the U.S. and foreign countries;. <U+25CF>Developments                                          or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;. <U+25CF>Changes                                          in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretation or principles;. <U+25CF>Risks                                          associated with utilizing information technology systems;. <U+25CF>Risks                                          associated with operating internationally, including currency translation risks;. <U+25CF>The                                          operating and stock performance of comparable companies;. 7. <U+25CF>Investors’                                          perceptions of us and our industry;. <U+25CF>General                                          economic, geopolitical, industry and market conditions;. <U+25CF>Changes                                          in tax requirements (including tax rate changes and new tax laws);. <U+25CF>Health                                          care reform;. <U+25CF>Unforeseen                                          developments in contingencies, such as litigation, could adversely affect our operating                                          results and financial condition; and. <U+25CF>Other                                          risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described from time to time                                          in our current and quarterly reports filed with US Securities and Exchange Commission.. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including under Part I, Item 1. “Business,” Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”. We are not under any duty to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform such statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations. You are advised, however, to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements contained in this report and any subsequently filed reports are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements.. Our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should carefully consider these risks before investing in shares of our common stock.. Risk Factors Related to Our Company. The bearing and engineered products industries are highly competitive, and competition could reduce our profitability or limit our ability to grow.. The global bearing and engineered products industries are highly competitive, and we compete with many U.S. and non-U.S. companies, some of which benefit from lower labor costs and fewer regulatory burdens than us. We compete primarily based on product qualifications, product line breadth, service and price. Certain competitors may be better able to manage costs than us or may have greater financial resources than we have. Due to the competitiveness in the bearing and engineered products industries we may not be able to increase prices for our products to cover increases in our costs, and we may face pressure to reduce prices, which could materially reduce our revenues, gross margin and profitability. Competitive factors, including changes in market penetration, increased price competition and the introduction of new products and technology by existing and new competitors could result in a material reduction in our revenues and profitability.. The loss of a major customer could result in a material reduction in our revenues and profitability.. Our top ten customers generated 36% and 37% of our net sales during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Accordingly, the loss of one or more of those customers or a substantial decrease in such customers’ purchases from us could result in a material reduction in our revenues and profitability.. In addition, the consolidation and combination of defense or other manufacturers may eliminate customers from the industry and/or put downward pricing pressures on sales of component parts. For example, the consolidation that has occurred in the defense industry in recent years has significantly reduced the overall number of defense contractors in the industry. In addition, if one of our customers is acquired or merged with another entity, the new entity may discontinue using us as a supplier because of an existing business relationship with the acquiring company or because it may be more efficient to consolidate certain suppliers within the newly formed enterprise. The significance of the impact that such consolidation may have on our business is difficult to predict because we do not know when or if one or more of our customers will engage in merger or acquisition activity. However, if such activity involved our material customers it could materially impact our revenues and profitability.. Weakness in any of the industries in which our customers operate, as well as the cyclical nature of our customers’ businesses generally, could materially reduce our revenues and profitability.. The commercial aerospace, mining and construction equipment and other diversified industrial industries to which we sell our products are, to varying degrees, cyclical and tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production. Margins in those industries are highly sensitive to demand cycles, and our customers in those industries historically have tended to delay large capital projects, including expensive maintenance and upgrades, during economic downturns. As a result, our business is also cyclical, and the demand for our products by these customers depends, in part, on overall levels of industrial production, general economic conditions and business confidence levels. Downward economic cycles could affect our customers and reduce sales of our products resulting in reductions in our revenues and net earnings. Any future material weakness in demand in any of these industries could materially reduce our revenues and profitability. Many of our customers have historically experienced periodic downturns, which often have had a negative effect on demand for our products. Previous industry downturns have negatively affected, and future industry downturns will negatively affect, our net sales, gross margin and net income.. 8. Future reductions or changes in U.S. government spending could negatively affect our business.. In fiscal 2018, 4.1% of our net sales were made directly, and we estimate that, including our diversified industrial market, approximately an additional 19.9% of our net sales were made indirectly, to the U.S. government to support military or other government projects. Our failure to obtain new government contracts, the cancellation of government contracts or reductions in federal budget appropriations regarding our products could result in materially reduced revenue. In addition, the funding of defense programs also competes with non-defense spending of the U.S. government. Our business is sensitive to changes in national and international priorities and the U.S. government budget. A shift in government defense spending to other programs in which we are not involved or a reduction in U.S. government defense spending generally could materially reduce our revenues, cash flows from operations and profitability. If we, or our prime contractors for which we are a subcontractor, fail to win any particular bid, or we are unable to replace lost business as a result of a cancellation, expiration or completion of a contract, our revenues or cash flows could be reduced.. The U.S. government continues to focus on developing and implementing spending, tax, and other initiatives to stimulate the economy, create jobs, and reduce the deficit. One of these initiatives, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (“BCA”), imposed greater constraints around government spending. In an attempt to balance decisions regarding defense, homeland security, and other federal spending priorities, the BCA immediately imposed spending caps that contain significant reductions to the Department of Defense (“DOD”) base budgets over a ten-year period ending in 2021. The BCA also provided for an automatic sequestration process, that impose additional cuts to the annual proposed DOD budgets continuing through 2021.. Although we cannot predict whether the automatic sequestration process will continue to proceed as set forth in the BCA or will be further modified by new or additional legislation, we believe our portfolio of programs and product offerings are well positioned and will not be materially impacted by such proposed DOD budget cuts. However, one or more of our programs could be reduced, extended, or terminated as a result of the U.S. Government’s continuing assessment of priorities, which could significantly impact our operations.. Fluctuating supply and costs of raw materials and energy resources could materially reduce our revenues, cash flow from operations and profitability.. Our business is dependent on the availability and costs of energy resources and raw materials, particularly steel, generally in the form of stainless and chrome steel, which are commodity steel products. The availability and prices of raw materials and energy sources may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels. The United States has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports which may increase the cost of raw materials and decrease the available supply. Although we currently maintain alternative sources for raw materials, our business is subject to the risk of price fluctuations and periodic delays in the delivery of certain raw materials. Disruptions in the supply of raw materials and energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers or require us to pay higher prices in order to obtain these raw materials or energy resources from other sources, which could thereby affect our net sales and profitability.. We seek to pass through a significant portion of our additional costs to our customers through steel surcharges or price increases. However, even if we are able to pass these steel surcharges or price increases to our customers, there may be a time lag of up to 3 months or more between the time a cost increase goes into effect and our ability to implement surcharges or price increases, particularly for orders already in our backlog. Competitive pressures and the terms of certain of our long-term contracts may require us to absorb at least part of these cost increases, particularly during periods of high inflation. As a result, our gross margin percentage may decline, and we may not be able to implement other price increases for our products. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to continue to pass these additional costs on to our customers at all or on a timely basis or that our customers will not seek alternative sources of supply if there are significant or prolonged increases in the price of steel or other raw materials or energy resources.. 9. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (“DRC”) and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012 the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use materials containing conflict minerals in their products mined from the DRC and adjoining countries. These new requirements necessitated due diligence efforts in calendar 2013, with initial disclosure requirements beginning in May 2014. There will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence to determine the sources of materials containing conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of these verification activities. The implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in certain of our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” materials, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain necessary materials containing conflict free minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face negative reactions from customers if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all materials containing conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement.. Our products are subject to certain approvals, and the loss of such approvals could materially reduce our revenues and profitability.. Essential to servicing the aerospace market is the ability to obtain product approvals. We have a substantial number of product approvals, which enable us to provide products used in virtually all domestic aircraft platforms presently in production or operation. Product approvals are typically issued by the FAA to designated OEMs who are Production Approval Holders of FAA approved aircraft. These Production Approval Holders provide quality control oversight and generally limit the number of suppliers directly servicing the commercial aerospace aftermarket. Regulations enacted by the FAA provide for an independent process (the PMA process), which enables suppliers who currently sell their products to the Production Approval Holders, to sell products to the aftermarket. Our foreign sales may be subject to similar approvals or U.S. export control restrictions. We cannot assure you that we will not lose approvals for our products in the future. The loss or suspension of product approvals could result in lost sales and materially reduce our revenues and profitability. The repair and overhaul of aircraft parts and accessories throughout the world is highly regulated by government agencies, including the FAA. Our repair and overhaul operations are subject to certification pursuant to regulations established by the FAA and other country government agencies which regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. New and more stringent government regulations, if adopted and enacted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. The retirement of commercial aircraft could reduce our revenues.. Our repair and overhaul operations repair, overhaul and sell jet engine and aircraft components. If aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline.. Work stoppages and other labor problems could materially reduce our ability to operate our business.. As of March 31, 2018, approximately 8.5% of our hourly employees were represented by labor unions in the U.S. While we believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory, the inability to satisfactorily negotiate and enter into new collective bargaining agreements upon expiration, or a lengthy strike or other work stoppage at any of our facilities, particularly at some of our larger facilities, could materially reduce our ability to operate our business. In addition, any attempt by our employees not currently represented by a union to join a union could result in additional expenses, including with respect to wages, benefits and pension obligations. We currently have three collective bargaining agreements covering employees within our Plymouth, Indiana, Fairfield, Connecticut and West Trenton, New Jersey locations.. In addition, work stoppages at one or more of our customers or suppliers, including suppliers of transportation services, many of which have large unionized workforces, for labor or other reasons could also cause disruptions to our business that we cannot control, and these disruptions may materially reduce our revenues and profitability.. 10. Unexpected equipment failures, catastrophic events or capacity constraints may increase our costs and reduce our sales due to production curtailments or shutdowns.. Our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of turning, milling, grinding, and electrical equipment, and this equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, earthquakes or violent weather conditions. In the future, we may experience material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of these types of equipment failures or catastrophes. Interruptions in production capabilities will inevitably increase our production costs and reduce sales and earnings for the affected period.. Certain of our facilities are operating at a full first shift with second and third shifts at some locations, and additional demand may require additional shifts and/or capital investments at these facilities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to add additional shifts as needed in a timely way and production constraints may result in lost sales. In certain markets we refrain from making additional capital investments to expand capacity where we believe market expansion in a particular end market is not sustainable or otherwise does not justify the expansion or capital investment. Our assumptions and forecasts regarding market conditions in these end markets may be erroneous and may result in lost earnings, potential sales going to competitors and inhibit our growth.. We may not be able to continue to make the acquisitions necessary for us to realize our growth strategy.. The acquisition of businesses that complement or expand our operations has been and continues to be an important element of our business strategy. We frequently engage in evaluations of potential acquisitions and negotiations for possible acquisitions, some of which, if consummated, could be significant to us. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates or completing acquisitions on favorable terms in the future. Our inability to acquire businesses, or to operate them profitably once acquired, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, cash flow and growth.. Our ability to realize anticipated benefits and synergies from the acquisitions may be affected by a number of factors, including: the use of more cash or other financial resources, and additional management time, attention and distraction, on integration and implementation activities than we expect, including restructuring and other exit costs; increases in other expenses related to an acquisition, which may offset any potential cost savings and other synergies from the acquisition; our ability to avoid labor disruptions or disputes in connection with any integration; the timing and impact of purchase accounting adjustments; difficulties in employee or management integration; and unanticipated liabilities associated with acquired businesses.. Any potential cost-saving opportunities may take at least several quarters following an acquisition to implement, and any results of these actions may not be realized for at least several quarters following implementation.. Businesses that we have acquired or that we may acquire in the future may have liabilities which are not known to us.. In certain cases, we have assumed liabilities of other acquired businesses and may assume liabilities of businesses that we acquire in the future. There may be liabilities or risks that we fail, or are unable, to discover, or that we underestimate, in the course of performing our due diligence investigations of acquired businesses. Additionally, businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may have made previous acquisitions, and we could be subject to certain liabilities and risks relating to these prior acquisitions as well. We cannot assure you that our rights to indemnification contained in definitive acquisition agreements that we have entered or may enter into will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the risk of unforeseen business uncertainties or related possible liabilities. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. As we begin to operate acquired businesses, we may learn additional information about them that adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities, issues relating to compliance with applicable laws or issues related to ongoing supply chain or customer relationships or order demand.. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles comprise a significant portion of our total assets, and if we determine that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles have become impaired in the future, our results of operations and financial condition in such years may be materially and adversely affected.. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Indefinite-lived intangibles represent long-standing brands acquired in business combinations and assumed to have indefinite lives. We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles at least annually for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the results of operations. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions about the future operating cash flows, growth rates, discount rates applied to these cash flows and current market estimates of value. A reduction in net income resulting from the write down or impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles would affect financial results and could have a material and adverse impact upon the market price of our common stock. If we are required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements because an impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles is determined, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.. 11. We depend heavily on our senior management and other key personnel, the loss of whom could materially affect our financial performance and prospects.. Our business is managed by a number of key executive officers, including Dr. Michael J. Hartnett. Our future success will depend on, among other things, our ability to keep the services of these executives and to hire other highly qualified employees at all levels.. We compete with other potential employers for employees, and we may not be successful in hiring and retaining executives and other skilled employees that we need. Our ability to successfully execute our business strategy, market and develop our products and serve our customers could be adversely affected by a shortage of available skilled employees or executives.. Our international operations are subject to risks inherent in such activities.. We have established operations in certain countries outside the U.S., including Mexico, France, Switzerland, Poland, China and Germany. Of our 45 facilities, 11 are located outside the U.S., including 9 manufacturing facilities.. In fiscal 2018, 12% of our net sales were generated by our international operations. We expect that this proportion is likely to increase as we seek to increase our penetration of foreign markets, including through acquisitions, particularly within the aerospace and defense markets. Our foreign operations are subject to the risks inherent in such activities such as: currency devaluations, logistical and communication challenges, costs of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, greater difficulties in protecting and maintaining our rights to intellectual property, difficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations, acts of terrorism or war or other acts that may cause social disruption which are difficult to quantify or predict and general economic conditions in these foreign markets. Our international operations may be negatively impacted by changes in government policies, such as changes in laws and regulations (or the interpretation thereof), restrictions on imports and exports, sources of supply, duties or tariffs, the introduction of measures to control inflation and changes in the rate or method of taxation. To date we have not experienced significant difficulties with the foregoing risks associated with our international operations.. We are subject to changes in legislative, regulatory and legal developments involving income and other taxes.. We are subject to U.S. federal, state, and international income, payroll, property, sales and use, fuel, and other types of taxes. Changes in tax rates, enactment of new tax laws, revisions of tax regulations, and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in substantially higher taxes and, therefore, could have a significant adverse effect on our results or operations, financial conditions and liquidity. U.S. income tax and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. Future legislation may substantially reduce (or have the effect of substantially reducing) our ability to defer U.S. taxes on profit permanently reinvested outside the United States. Additionally, they could have a negative impact on our ability to compete in the global marketplace.. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA” or “the Act”). The Act includes a number of changes in existing tax laws impacting businesses including, among other things, a permanent reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35.0% to a flat rate 21.0%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense (except for certain small businesses), elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain exceptions) and a one-time taxation of foreign earnings at reduced rates, regardless of whether or not they are repatriated. Notwithstanding the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate, the overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law. Financial results for fiscal 2018 reflect provisional estimates based on our initial analysis and current interpretation of the legislation.. 12. Currency translation risks may have a material impact on our results of operations.. Our Swiss operation utilizes the Swiss Franc as the functional currency, our French and German operations utilize the Euro as the functional currency, our Polish operation utilizes the Polish Zloty as the functional currency and our Canadian operation utilizes the Canadian Dollar as the functional currency. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in earnings. Foreign currency transaction exposure arises primarily from the transfer of foreign currency from one subsidiary to another within the group and to foreign currency denominated trade receivables. Unrealized currency translation gains and losses are recognized upon translation of the foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets to U.S. dollars. Because our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our earnings. We periodically enter into derivative financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates on certain third-party sales transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. Currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance in the future and we cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations. See Part II, Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Foreign Currency Exchange Rates.”. We may be required to make significant future contributions to our pension plan.. As of March 31, 2018, we maintained one noncontributory defined benefit pension plan. The plan was overfunded by $0.3 million as of March 31, 2018 and was underfunded by $1.9 million as of April 1, 2017, which are the amounts by which the accumulated benefit obligations are less or more than the sum of the fair market value of the plan’s assets. We are required to make cash contributions to our pension plan to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by employee benefit laws and tax laws. The amount of any such required contributions is determined based on annual actuarial valuation of the plan as performed by the plan’s actuaries. The amount of future contributions will depend upon asset returns, then-current discount rates and a number of other factors, and, as a result, the amount we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plan in the future may increase significantly. Additionally, there is a risk that if the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation concludes that its risk with respect to our pension plan may increase unreasonably if the plan continues to operate, if we are unable to satisfy the minimum funding requirement for the plan or if the plan becomes unable to pay benefits, then the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation could terminate the plan and take control of its assets. In such event, we may be required to make an immediate payment to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation of all or a substantial portion of the underfunding as calculated by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation based upon its own assumptions. The underfunding calculated by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation could be substantially greater than the underfunding we have calculated because, for example, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation may use a significantly lower discount rate. If such payment is not made, then the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation could place liens on a material portion of our assets and the assets of any members of our controlled group. Such action could result in a material increase in our pension related expenses and a corresponding reduction in our cash flow and net income. For additional information concerning our pension plan and plan liabilities, see Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” Note 11 “Pension Plans.”. We may incur material losses for product liability and recall related claims.. We are subject to a risk of product and recall related liability in the event that the failure, use or misuse of any of our products results in personal injury, death, or property damage or our products do not conform to our customers’ specifications. In particular, our products are installed in a number of types of vehicle fleets, including airplanes, trains, automobiles, heavy trucks and farm equipment, many of which are subject to government ordered as well as voluntary recalls by the manufacturer. If one of our products is found to be defective, causes a fleet to be disabled or otherwise results in a product recall, significant claims may be brought against us. We currently maintain product liability insurance coverage for product liability, although not for recall related claims, we cannot assure you that product liability or recall related claims, if made, would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or would be covered by insurance which, in turn, may result in material losses related to these claims, increased future insurance costs and a corresponding reduction in our cash flow and net income.. Environmental regulations impose substantial costs and limitations on our operations, and environmental compliance may be more costly than we expect.. We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the storage, handling and disposal of wastes and the health and safety of employees. These laws and regulations could subject us to material costs and liabilities, including compliance costs, civil and criminal fines imposed for failure to comply with these laws and regulatory and litigation costs. We also may be liable under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or similar state laws, for the costs of investigation and clean-up of contamination at facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us or at other facilities at which we have disposed of hazardous substances. In connection with such contamination, we may also be liable for natural resource damages, government penalties and claims by third parties for personal injury and property damage. Compliance with these laws and regulations may prove to be more limiting and costly than we anticipate. New laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could cause a material increase in our environmental related compliance costs and a corresponding reduction in our cash flow and net income. Investigation and remediation of contamination at some of our sites is ongoing. Actual costs to clean-up these sites may exceed our current estimates. Although we have indemnities and other agreements for certain pre-closing environmental liabilities from the prior owners in connection with our acquisition of several of our facilities, we cannot assure you that the indemnities will be adequate to cover known or newly discovered pre-closing liabilities.. 13. Our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could adversely affect our business and results of operations; in addition, we may be subject to infringement claims by third parties.. Our ability to compete effectively is dependent upon our ability to protect and preserve the intellectual property and other proprietary rights and materials owned, licensed or otherwise used by us. We have numerous U.S. and foreign patents, trademark registrations and U.S. copyright registrations. We also have U.S. and foreign trademark and patent applications pending. We cannot assure you that our pending trademark and patent applications will result in trademark registrations and issued patents, and our failure to secure rights under these applications may limit our ability to protect the intellectual property rights that these applications were intended to cover. Although we have attempted to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights both in the United States and in foreign countries through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection and non-disclosure agreements, these steps may be insufficient to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, particularly in foreign countries where the protection available for such intellectual property and other proprietary rights may be limited. We cannot assure you that any of our intellectual property rights will not be infringed upon or that our trade secrets will not be misappropriated or otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors. We may not have adequate remedies available for any such infringement or other unauthorized use. We cannot assure you that any infringement claims asserted by us will not result in our intellectual property being challenged or invalidated, that our intellectual property will be held to be of adequate scope to protect our business or that we will be able to deter current and former employees, contractors or other parties from breaching confidentiality obligations and misappropriating trade secrets. In addition, we may become subject to claims which could require us to pay damages or limit our ability to use certain intellectual property and other proprietary rights found to be in violation of a third party’s rights, and, in the event such litigation is successful, we may be unable to use such intellectual property and other proprietary rights at all or on reasonable terms. Regardless of its outcome, any litigation, whether commenced by us or third parties, could be protracted and costly and could result in increased litigation related expenses, the loss of intellectual property rights or payment of money or other damages, which may result in lost sales and reduced cash flow and decrease our net income. See Part I, Item 1 “Business—Intellectual Property.”. Cancellation of orders in our backlog could negatively impact our revenues.. As of March 31, 2018, we had an order backlog of $392.1 million, which we estimate will be fulfilled within the next 12 months. However, orders included in our backlog are subject to cancellation, delay or other modifications by our customers prior to fulfillment. For these reasons, we cannot assure you that orders included in our backlog will ultimately result in the actual receipt of revenues from such orders.. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud could harm our business. To date, we have not detected any material weakness or significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting. However, we are continuing to evaluate and, where appropriate, enhance our policies, procedures and internal controls. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation. In addition, failure to maintain adequate internal controls could result in financial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.. 14. Health care reform could adversely affect our operating results.. In 2010, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive health care reform legislation. Due to the breadth and complexity of this legislation, as well as its phased-in nature of implementation and lack of interpretive guidance, it is difficult for us to predict the overall effects it will have on our business over the coming years. To date, we have not experienced significant costs related to the health care reform legislation; however, it is possible that our operating results could be adversely affected in the future by increased costs, expanded liability exposure and requirements that change the ways we provide healthcare and other benefits to our employees.. Unforeseen developments in contingencies, such as litigation, could adversely affect our financial condition.. We and certain of our subsidiaries are, and from time to time may become, parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to their businesses involving alleged injuries arising out of the use of their products, exposure to hazardous substances, or patent infringement, employment matters, and commercial disputes. The defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management’s attention, and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures.. Changes in accounting standards or changes in the interpretations of existing standards could affect our financial results.. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). From time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards and related interpretations issued by the FASB and the SEC. Any change in these accounting principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, may retroactively affect previously reported results, could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, and may require us to make costly changes to our operational processes and accounting systems. In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes most existing generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) regarding revenue recognition. We will adopt this ASU on April 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. As a result of applying this approach, we will be recording a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The impact will be immaterial. Further information regarding our adoption of this new accounting standard is included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”.. Risks associated with utilizing information technology systems could adversely affect our operations.. We rely upon our information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information to manage and operate our business. Further, in the ordinary course of business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our employees, on our networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our business operations.. As a U.S. government contractor, we may face certain security threats, including malicious software malware, phishing and other cybersecurity intrusions to our information technology infrastructure, attempts to gain unauthorized access to proprietary, classified or confidential information, and threats to the physical security of our information technology systems. In addition to security threats, we may also be subject to other systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures. The unavailability of our information or communications systems, the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated or any significant breach of data security could cause loss of data, disrupt our operations, require significant management attention and resources, subject us to litigation, penalties, regulatory actions or contract termination, and negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, which could have a negative impact on our financial and competitive position, results of operations and liquidity.. Although we have implemented certain preventative measures which may help mitigate the damage from such occurrences, the damage and disruption to our business resulting from any of these events may be significant. We continue to evaluate the need to upgrade and/or replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment, to improve the effectiveness of our systems and strengthen our cybersecurity requirements, however, our systems implementations may not result in the protection or improvements at the levels anticipated. As a U.S. government contractor, we are also subject to regulatory compliance requirements under the DFARS and other federal regulations that require our IT systems to comply with the security and privacy controls in National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-171 (NIST 800-171).. 15. Risk Factors Related to our Common Stock. Provisions in our charter documents may prevent or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us.. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions which might benefit our stockholders or in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors (the “Board”) without stockholder approval. Holders of the common stock may not have preemptive rights to subscribe for a pro rata portion of any capital stock which may be issued by us. In the event of issuance, such preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of us or could impede our stockholders’ ability to approve a transaction they consider in their best interests. Although we have no present intention to issue any new shares of preferred stock, we may do so in the future.. We may not pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.. Except for a $2.00 per common share special dividend paid on June 13, 2014, we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and may not pay cash dividends in the future. Instead, we plan to apply earnings and excess cash, if any, to the expansion and development of the business. Thus, the return on your investment, if any, could depend solely on an increase, if any, in the market value of our common stock."
