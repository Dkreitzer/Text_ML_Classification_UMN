[1] "Item 1A.     Risk Factors. Investing in our common stock involves a number of significant risks.  In addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, investors should consider the following information before making an investment in our common stock.  The risks and uncertainties described below could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. Risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or not presently deemed material by us, may also impair our operations and performance.  If any of the following risks, or risks not presently known to us, actually occur, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND STRUCTURE. Our financial condition and results of operations will depend on our ability to effectively allocate and manage capital.. Our ability to achieve our investment objective of maximizing risk-adjusted returns to shareholders depends on our ability to effectively allocate and manage capital.  Capital allocation depends, in part, upon our investment team's ability to identify, evaluate, invest in and monitor companies that meet our investment criteria.. Accomplishing our investment objectives is largely a function of our investment team's management of the investment process and our access to investments offering attractive risk adjusted returns.  In addition, members of our investment team are called upon, from time to time, to provide managerial assistance to some of our portfolio companies.. The results of our operations depend on many factors, including the availability of opportunities for investment, readily accessible short and long-term funding alternatives in the financial markets and economic conditions. Our ability to make new investments at attractive relative returns is also a function of our marketing and our management of the investment process, as well as conditions in the private credit market in which we invest. If we fail to invest our capital effectively, our return on equity may be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of the shares of our common stock.. Any unrealized losses we experience may be an indication of future realized losses, which could reduce our income available to make distributions.. As a BDC, we are required to carry our investments at market value or, if no market value is ascertainable, at the fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors pursuant to a valuation methodology approved by our Board of Directors. Decreases in the market values or fair values of our investments will be recorded as unrealized losses. An unrealized loss could be an indication of a portfolio company's inability to generate cash flow or meet its repayment obligations. This could result in realized losses in the future and ultimately in reductions of our income available to pay dividends or interest and principal on our securities and could have a material adverse effect on your investment.. 22. Table of Contents. Our business model depends to a significant extent upon strong referral relationships.  Our inability to maintain or develop these relationships, as well as the failure of these relationships to generate investment opportunities, could adversely affect our business.. We expect that members of our management team will maintain their relationships with financial sponsors, intermediaries, financial institutions, investment bankers, commercial bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, consultants and other individuals within our network, and we will rely to a significant extent upon these relationships to provide us with potential investment opportunities.  If our management team fails to maintain its existing relationships or develop new relationships with sources of investment opportunities, we will not be able to effectively invest our capital.  Individuals with whom members of our management team have relationships are not obligated to provide us with investment opportunities; therefore, there is no assurance that these relationships will generate investment opportunities for us.. In addition to regulatory limitations on our ability to raise capital, our current debt obligations contain various covenants, which, if not complied with, could accelerate our repayment obligations under the Credit Facility or the December 2022 Notes, thereby materially and adversely affecting our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay distributions.. We will have a continuing need for capital to finance our investments. We are party to a senior secured credit facility, dated as of August 30, 2016 and amended as of November 16, 2017, which we refer to as the Credit Facility. As of March 31, 2018, the Credit Facility provides us with a revolving credit line of up to $180.0 million of which $40.0 million was drawn. On April 16, 2018 and May 11, 2018, CSWC entered into Incremental Assumption Agreements, which increased the total commitments under the Credit Facility by $20 million and $10 million, respectively. The increases were executed under the accordion feature of the Credit Facility and increased total commitments from $180 million to $210 million.. The Credit Facility contains customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, affirmative and negative covenants such as information reporting requirements, minimum consolidated net worth, minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio, minimum asset coverage, and maintenance of RIC tax treatment and BDC status. The Credit Facility also contains customary events of default with customary cure and notice provisions, including, without limitation, nonpayment, misrepresentation of representations and warranties in a material respect, breach of covenants, bankruptcy, and change of control. The Credit Facility permits us to fund additional loans and investments as long as we are within the conditions set out in the Credit Facility.. In December 2017, we issued $57.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.95% Notes due 2022, or the December 2022 Notes. The indenture governing the December 2022 Notes contains certain covenants including but not limited to (i) a requirement that we comply with the asset coverage requirement of Section 61 of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions thereto, after giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC, (ii) a requirement, subject to a limited exception, that we will not declare any cash dividend, or declare any other cash distribution, upon a class of our capital stock, or purchase any such capital stock, unless, in every such case, at the time of the declaration of any such dividend or distribution, or at the time of any such purchase, we have the minimum asset coverage required pursuant to Section 61 of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions thereto after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase price, as the case may be, giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC and (iii) a requirement to provide financial information to the holders of the December 2022 Notes and the trustee under the indenture if we should no longer be subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. The indenture and supplement relating to the December 2022 Notes also provides for customary events of default.. Our continued compliance with these covenants depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control, and there are no assurances that we will continue to comply with these covenants. Our failure to satisfy these covenants could result in foreclosure by our lenders, which would accelerate our repayment obligations under the facility and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders.. All of our assets are subject to security interests under our secured Credit Facility and if we default on our obligations under the Credit Facility, we may suffer adverse consequences, including foreclosure on our assets.. 23. Table of Contents. All of our assets are currently pledged as collateral under our Credit Facility. If we default on our obligations under the Credit Facility, the lenders party thereto may have the right to foreclose upon and sell, or otherwise transfer, the collateral subject to their security interests. In such event, we may be forced to sell our investments to raise funds to repay our outstanding borrowings in order to avoid foreclosure and these forced sales may be at times and at prices we would not consider advantageous. Moreover, such deleveraging of our company could significantly impair our ability to effectively operate our business in the manner in which we have historically operated. As a result, we could be forced to curtail or cease new investment activities and lower or eliminate the dividends that we have historically paid to our shareholders. In addition, if the lenders exercise their right to sell the assets pledged under our Credit Facility, such sales may be completed at distressed sale prices, thereby diminishing or potentially eliminating the amount of cash available to us after repayment of the amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility. These distressed prices could be materially below our most recent valuation of each security, which could have a significantly negative effect on NAV.. Because we borrow money to make investments, the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested in us is magnified and may increase the risk of investing in us.. Borrowings to fund investments, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for loss on investments in our indebtedness and gain or loss on investments in our equity capital. As we use leverage to partially finance our investments, you will experience increased risks of investing in our securities. We may borrow from banks and other lenders, including under our Credit Facility, and may issue debt securities or enter into other types of borrowing arrangements in the future. If the value of our assets decreases, leveraging would cause NAV to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged our business. Similarly, any decrease in our income would cause net investment income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not leveraged our business. Such a decline could negatively affect our ability to pay common stock dividends, scheduled debt payments or other payments related to our securities. Use of leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique.. As of March 31, 2018, we had $40.0 million debt outstanding under our Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, on a per annum basis at a rate equal to the applicable LIBOR rate plus 3.00%, with a step-down to LIBOR plus 2.75% at the time the Company's net worth exceeds $325 million. We pay unused commitment fees of 0.50% to 1.00% per annum, based on utilization, on the unused lender commitments under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets. If we are unable to meet the financial obligations under the Credit Facility, the lenders under the Credit Facility may exercise its remedies under the Credit Facility as the result of a default by us. On April 16, 2018 and May 11, 2018, CSWC entered into Incremental Assumption Agreements, which increased the total commitments under the Credit Facility by $20 million and $10 million, respectively. The increases were executed under the accordion feature of the Credit Facility and increased total commitments from $180 million to $210 million.. As of March 31, 2018, the carrying amount of the December 2022 Notes was $55.3 million. The December 2022 Notes mature on December 15, 2022 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time, or from time to time, at our option on or after December 15, 2019. The December 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.95% per year, payable quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year. The December 2022 Notes are an unsecured obligation, rank pari passu with our other outstanding and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness, including borrowings under our Credit Facility.. Our ability to achieve our investment objective may depend in part on our ability to access additional leverage on favorable terms by borrowing from banks or insurance companies or by issuing debt securities and there can be no assurance that such additional leverage can in fact be achieved.. 24.

Actual interest payments may be different.. (2) \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIn order for us to cover our annual interest payments on indebtedness, we must achieve annual returns on our March 31, 2018 total assets of at least 1.66%.. If we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets, we could fail to qualify as a BDC or be precluded from investing according to our current business strategy.. As a BDC, we may not acquire any assets other than \"qualifying assets\" unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such acquisition, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets.. Currently, more than 70% of our assets consist of qualifying assets. However, we may be precluded from investing in what we believe are attractive investments if those investments are not qualifying assets for purposes of the 1940 Act. Similarly, these rules could prevent us from making follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies or we could be required to dispose of investments at inappropriate times to comply with the 1940 Act (which could result in the dilution of our position).. A failure on our part to maintain our status as a BDC would significantly reduce our operating flexibility.. If we fail to maintain our status as a BDC, we might be regulated as a closed-end investment company that is required to register under the 1940 Act, which would subject us to additional regulatory restrictions and significantly decrease our operating flexibility. In addition, any such failure could cause an event of default under our outstanding indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.. We will be subject to corporate-level U.S. Federal income tax if we are unable to qualify as a Regulated Investment Company under Subchapter M of the Code.. To maintain RIC tax treatment under the Code, we must meet the following annual distribution, income source and asset diversification requirements:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe annual distribution requirement for a RIC will be satisfied if we distribute to our shareholders on an annual basis at least 90% of our net ordinary income and realized short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses.  Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income. Any such carryover taxable income must be distributed through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year that generated such taxable income..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe source of income requirement will be satisfied if we obtain at least 90% of our gross income for each taxable year from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or other securities or foreign currencies or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies and net income derived from an interest in a \"qualified publicly traded partnership\" (as defined in the Code), or the 90% Income Test..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe asset diversification requirement will be satisfied if we meet certain asset diversification requirements at the end of each quarter of our taxable year.  To satisfy this requirement, at least 50% of the value of our assets must consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of. 25. Table of Contents. the outstanding voting securities of the issuer (which for these purposes includes the equity securities of a \"qualified publicly traded partnership\").  In addition, no more than 25% of the value of our assets can be invested in the securities, other than U.S Government securities or securities of other RICs, (1) of one issuer (2) of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or (3) of one or more \"qualified publicly traded partnerships,\" or the Diversification Tests.. Failure to meet these requirements may result in us having to dispose of certain unqualified investments quickly in order to prevent the loss of RIC tax treatment. If we fail to maintain RIC tax treatment for any reason and are subject to corporate income tax, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions.  In addition, to the extent we had unrealized gains, we would have to establish deferred tax liabilities for taxes, which would reduce our NAV accordingly. In addition, our shareholders would lose the tax credit realized when we, as a RIC, decide to retain the net realized capital gain and make deemed distributions of net realized capital gains, and pay taxes on behalf of our shareholders at the end of the tax year.  The loss of this pass-through tax treatment could have a material adverse effect on the total return of an investment in our common stock.. Even if the Company qualifies as a Regulated Investment Company, it may face tax liabilities that reduce its cash flow.. Even if we qualify for taxation as a RIC, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and assets. In addition, we may hold some of our assets through our Taxable Subsidiary, which is not consolidated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or any other taxable subsidiary we may form. Any taxes paid by our subsidiary corporations would decrease the cash available for distribution to our shareholders.. Our historical financial statements are not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as a stand-alone publicly-traded company and therefore may not be indicative of our future performance.. As part of the Share Distribution, we spun off 63.5% of our NAV to our shareholders and divested other major investments during the past three years. We emerged from these divestitures and the Share Distribution with a significantly different company profile.  Our historical financial statements included in this Form 10-K for historical periods are not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as a stand-alone publicly traded company with a smaller market footprint.  Accordingly, this data may not be indicative of our future performance, or necessarily reflect what our financial position and results of operations or cash flows would have been, had we operated as a separate, stand-alone publicly-traded entity during all of the periods presented.. Our investment portfolio is and will continue to be recorded at fair value.  Our Board of Directors has final responsibility for overseeing, reviewing and approving, in good faith, our fair value determination. As a result of recording our investments at fair value, there is and will continue to be subjectivity as to the value of our portfolio investments.. Under the 1940 Act, we are required to carry our portfolio investments at market value or, if there is no readily available market value, at fair value as determined by us, with our Board of Directors having final responsibility for overseeing, reviewing and approving, in good faith, our fair value determination.  Typically, there is not a public market for the securities of the privately held companies in which we have invested and will continue to invest.  As a result, we value these securities quarterly at fair value based on inputs from management and our investment team, along with the oversight, review and approval of our Board of Directors.. The determination of fair value and, consequently, the amount of unrealized gains and losses in our portfolio, are to a certain degree, subjective and dependent on a valuation process approved by our Board of Directors.  Certain factors that may be considered in determining the fair value of our investments include external events, such as private mergers, sales and acquisitions involving comparable companies.  Because of the inherent uncertainty of the valuation of portfolio securities that do not have readily ascertainable market values, our fair value determinations may differ materially from the values a third party would be willing to pay for our portfolio securities or the values which would be applicable to unrestricted securities having a public market.  Due to this uncertainty, our fair value determinations may cause our NAV on a given date to materially understate or overstate the value that we may ultimately realize on one or more of our investments.  As a result, investors purchasing our common stock based on an overstated NAV may pay a higher price. 26. Table of Contents. than the value of our investments might warrant.  Conversely, investors selling shares during a period in which the NAV understates the value of our investments may receive a lower price for their shares than the value of our investments might warrant.. The capital markets may experience periods of disruption and instability. Such market conditions may materially and adversely affect debt and equity capital markets in the United States, which may have a negative impact on our business and operations.. From time to time, capital markets may experience periods of disruption and instability.  For example, between 2008 and 2009, the global capital markets were unstable as evidenced by periodic disruptions in liquidity in the debt capital markets, significant write-offs in the financial services sector, the re-pricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated credit market and the failure of major financial institutions.  These events contributed to worsening general economic conditions that materially and adversely impacted the broader financial and credit markets and reduced the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole and financial services firms in particular.  While market conditions have largely recovered from the events of 2008 and 2009, there have been continuing periods of volatility, some lasting longer than others. There can be no assurance these market conditions will not repeat themselves or worsen in the future.   The reappearance of market conditions similar to those experienced from 2008 through 2009 for any substantial length of time could make it difficult to extend the maturity of or refinance our existing indebtedness or obtain new indebtedness with similar terms.  Additionally, the debt capital that will be available to us in the future may be at a higher cost and on less favorable terms than what we currently experience due to the existence of a rising interest rate environment.  If any of these conditions appear, they may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  These events could limit our investment originations, limit our ability to increase returns to equity holders through the effective use of leverage, and negatively impact our operating results.. In addition, significant changes or volatility in the capital markets may also have a negative effect on the valuations of our investments. While most of our investments are not publicly traded, applicable accounting standards require us to assume as part of our valuation process that our investments are sold in a principal market to market participants (even if we plan on holding an investment through its maturity). Significant changes in the capital markets may also affect the pace of our investment activity and the potential for liquidity events involving our investments. Thus, the illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell our investments to access capital if required, and as a result, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded our investments if we were required to sell them for liquidity purposes. An inability to raise or access capital could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.. Changes in the laws or regulations governing our business, or changes in the interpretations thereof, and any failure by us to comply with these laws or regulations, could negatively affect the profitability of our operations.. Changes in the laws or regulations or the interpretations of the laws and regulations that govern BDCs, RICs or non-depository commercial lenders could significantly affect our operations and our cost of doing business. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations and are subject to judicial and administrative decisions that affect our operations, including our loan originations, maximum interest rates, fees and other charges, disclosures to portfolio companies, the terms of secured transactions, collection and foreclosure procedures and other trade practices. If these laws, regulations or decisions change, or if we expand our business into jurisdictions that have adopted more stringent requirements than those in which we currently conduct business, we may have to incur significant expenses in order to comply or we might have to restrict our operations. In addition, if we do not comply with applicable laws, regulations and decisions, we may lose licenses needed for the conduct of our business and be subject to civil fines and criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations or financial condition.. We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.. We compete for attractive investment opportunities with other financial institutions, including BDCs, junior capital lenders, and banks.  Some of these competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial, technical and marketing resources, and some are subject to different, and frequently less stringent, regulations.  Our competitors may have a lower cost of funds and may have access to funding sources that are not available to us.  Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC.  As a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, and there can. 27. Table of Contents. be no assurance that we will be able to identify and make investments that satisfy our objectives.  A significant increase in the number and/or size of our competitors in our target market could force us to accept less attractive investment terms.  We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.. Adverse market and economic conditions could cause harm to our operating results.. Past recessions have had a significant negative impact on the operating performance and fair value of many middle market companies. Many of our portfolio companies could be adversely impacted again by any future economic downturn or recession and may be unable to be sold at a price that would allow us to recover our investment, or may be unable to operate during a recession. Such portfolio company performance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel in a competitive environment.. Sourcing, selection, structuring and closing our investments depends upon the diligence and skill of our management.  Our management's capabilities may significantly impact our results of operations.  Our success requires that we retain investment and operations personnel in a competitive environment.  Our ability to attract and retain personnel with the requisite credentials, experience and skills depends on several factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to offer competitive wages, benefits and professional growth opportunities.. The competitive environment for qualified personnel may require us to take certain measures to ensure that we are able to attract and retain experienced personnel.  Such measures may include increasing the attractiveness of our overall compensation packages, altering the structure of our compensation packages through the use of additional forms of compensation or other steps.  The inability to attract and retain experienced personnel could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.. In connection with CSWI's separation from us, CSWI has indemnified us for certain liabilities.  However, there can be no assurance that these indemnities will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities or that CSWI's ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future.. CSWI agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, including certain tax liabilities.  However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that CSWI has agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that CSWI will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations.  Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from CSWI any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses while seeking recovery from CSWI.. Potential indemnification liabilities of us to CSWI could materially adversely affect us.. Agreements relating to the Share Distribution between us and CSWI provide for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for liabilities that may exist relating to or arising out of our business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the Share Distribution.. Potential liabilities may arise due to fraudulent transfer considerations, which would adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations.. In connection with the Share Distribution, we undertook several corporate restructuring transactions which, along with the Share Distribution, may be subject to federal and state fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws. If, under these laws, a court were to determine that, at the time of the Share Distribution, any entity involved in these restructuring transactions or the Share Distribution: (1) was insolvent; (2) was rendered insolvent by reason of the Share Distribution; (3) had remaining assets constituting unreasonably small capital; or (4) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay these debts as they matured, then the court could void the Share Distribution, in whole or in part, as a fraudulent conveyance or transfer, the court could require us to fund liabilities of the other company for the benefit of creditors.. 28. Table of Contents. Recent legislation may allow us to incur additional leverage, which could increase the risk of investing in the Company.. The 1940 Act generally prohibits us from incurring indebtedness unless immediately after such borrowing we have an asset coverage for total borrowings of at least 200% (i.e., the amount of debt may not exceed 50% of the value of our total assets). However, on March 23, 2018, the Small Business Credit Availability Act (the \"SBCA\") was signed into law, which included various changes to regulations under the federal securities laws that impact BDCs. The SBCA included changes to the 1940 Act to allow BDCs to decrease their asset coverage requirement from 200% to 150%, if certain requirements are met. Under the SBCA, we are allowed to reduce our asset coverage requirement to 150%, and thereby increase our leverage capacity, if shareholders representing at least a majority of the votes cast, when a quorum is present, approve a proposal to do so. If we receive shareholder approval, we would be allowed to reduce our asset coverage requirement to 150% on the first day after such approval. Alternatively, the SBCA allows the majority of our independent directors to approve the reduction in our asset coverage requirement to 150%, and such approval would become effective on the one-year anniversary of such approval. In either case, we would be required to make certain disclosures on our website and in SEC filings regarding, among other things, the receipt of approval to reduce our asset coverage requirement to 150%, our leverage capacity and usage, and risks related to leverage.. On April 25, 2018, the Board, including a \"required majority\" (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Board, approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, the minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to the Company will be decreased from 200% to 150%, effective April 25, 2019. The Board also approved a resolution which limits the Company's issuance of senior securities such that the asset coverage ratio, taking into account such issuance, would not be less than 166%, effective April 25, 2019.. Leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique and increases the risk of investing in our securities. Leverage magnifies the potential for loss on investments in our indebtedness and on invested equity capital. As we use leverage to partially finance our investments, you will experience increased risks of investing in our securities. If the value of our assets increases, then leveraging would cause the net asset value attributable to our common stock to increase more sharply than it would have had we not leveraged. Conversely, if the value of our assets decreases, leveraging would cause net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged our business. Similarly, any increase in our income in excess of interest payable on the borrowed funds would cause our net investment income to increase more than it would without the leverage, while any decrease in our income would cause net investment income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not borrowed. Such a decline could negatively affect our ability to pay common stock dividends, scheduled debt payments or other payments related to our securities. If we incur additional leverage, you will experience increased risks of investing in our common stock.. Efforts to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act involve significant expenditures, and non-compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may adversely affect us.. We are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. Among other requirements, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, our management is required to report on our internal controls over financial reporting. We are required to review on an annual basis our internal controls over financial reporting, and on a quarterly and annual basis to evaluate and disclose significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting. We have and expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which will negatively impact our financial performance and our ability to make distributions. In addition, this process results in a diversion of management's time and attention. In the event that we are unable to maintain compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules, we may be adversely affected.. Our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted.. We are prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with certain of our affiliates without the prior approval of our independent directors and, in some cases, the SEC. Any person that owns, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our outstanding voting securities is our affiliate for purposes of the 1940 Act, and we generally are prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to an affiliate, absent the prior approval of our independent directors. The 1940 Act also prohibits certain \"joint\" transactions with certain of our affiliates, which could include investments in the same portfolio company (whether at the same or different times), without prior approval of our. 29. Table of Contents. independent directors and, in some cases, the SEC. If a person acquires more than 25% of our voting securities, we are prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to that person or certain of that person's affiliates, or entering into prohibited joint transactions with that person, absent the prior approval of the SEC. Similar restrictions limit our ability to transact business with our officers or directors or their affiliates.. Regulations governing our operation as a BDC will affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital.. Our business will require capital to operate and grow. We may acquire such additional capital from the following sources:. Senior Securities. We may issue debt securities and/or borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, which we refer to collectively as senior securities. As a result of issuing senior securities, we will be exposed to additional risks, including the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tUnder the provisions of the 1940 Act, we are permitted, as a BDC, to issue senior securities only in amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% (or, pursuant to recent legislation, 150% if certain requirements are met as described in the Business Section under \"Regulation as a Business Development Company - Senior Securities\") immediately after each issuance of senior securities. If the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy this test. If that happens, we will be prohibited from issuing debt securities and/or borrowing money from banks or other financial institutions and may not be permitted to declare a dividend or make any distribution to shareholders or repurchase shares until such time as we satisfy this test..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAny amounts that we use to service our debt will not be available for dividends to our common shareholders..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIt is likely that any senior securities or other indebtedness we issue will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, some of these securities or other indebtedness may be rated by rating agencies, and in obtaining a rating for such securities and other indebtedness, we may be required to abide by operating and investment guidelines that further restrict operating and financial flexibility..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe and, indirectly, our stockholders will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities and other indebtedness..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAny unsecured debt issued by us would rank (1) pari passu with our future unsecured indebtedness and effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and (2) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tUpon a liquidation of our company, holders of our debt securities and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Future offerings of additional debt securities, which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation, or equity securities, which could dilute our existing stockholders, may harm the value of our common stock.. Additional Common Stock. The 1940 Act prohibits us from selling shares of our common stock at a price below the current NAV per share of such stock, with certain exceptions. One such exception is prior shareholder approval of issuances below current NAV per share provided that our Board of Directors makes certain determinations. We did not seek shareholder authorization to sell shares of our common stock below the then current NAV per share of our common stock at our 2017 annual meeting of shareholders. We do not anticipate seeking such authorization in the future. However, in the event we change our position, we will seek the requisite approval of our common shareholders. If we raise additional funds by issuing more common stock or senior securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common stock, the percentage ownership of our shareholders at that time would decrease, and they may experience dilution. Moreover, we can offer no assurance that we will be able to issue and sell additional equity securities in the future, on favorable terms or at all.. We cannot predict how tax reform legislation will affect us, our investments, or our shareholders, and any such legislation could adversely affect our business.. Legislative or other actions relating to taxes could have a negative effect on us. The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S.. 30. Table of Contents. Treasury Department. The U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate recently passed tax reform legislation, which the President recently signed into law. Such legislation will make many changes to the Code, including significant changes to the taxation of business entities, the deductibility of interest expense, and the tax treatment of capital investment. We cannot predict with certainty how any changes in the tax laws might affect us, our shareholders, or our portfolio investments. New legislation and any U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions interpreting such legislation could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC or the U.S. federal income tax consequences to us and our shareholders of such qualification, or could have other adverse consequences. Shareholders are urged to consult with their tax advisor regarding tax legislative, regulatory, or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our securities.. We are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends.. Our business is highly dependent on our and third parties' communications and information systems. Any failure or interruption of those systems, including as a result of the termination of an agreement with any third-party service providers, could cause delays or other problems in our activities. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control and adversely affect our business. There could be:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSudden electrical or telecommunications outages;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tNatural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tEvents arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCyber-attacks.. If we are unable to maintain the availability of our electronic data systems and safeguard the security of our data, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, which could impair our liquidity, disrupt our business, damage our reputation and cause losses.. Cybersecurity refers to the combination of technologies, processes, and procedures established to protect information technology systems and data from unauthorized access, attack, or damage. We are subject to cybersecurity risks. Information cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years and, while we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, we could suffer such losses in the future. Our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. If one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize confidential and other information, including nonpublic personal information and sensitive business data, processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers or counterparties. This could result in significant losses, reputational damage, litigation, regulatory fines or penalties, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Privacy and information security laws and regulation changes, and compliance with those changes, may result in cost increases due to system changes and the development of new administrative processes. In the future, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks. In addition, we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are not fully insured.. Third parties with which we do business may also be sources of cybersecurity or other technological risks. We outsource certain functions, and these relationships allow for the storage and processing of our information, as well as customer, counterparty, employee and borrower information. While we engage in actions to reduce our exposure resulting from outsourcing, ongoing threats may result in unauthorized access, loss, exposure or destruction of data, or other cybersecurity incidents, with increased costs and other consequences, including those described above.. 31. Table of Contents. Terrorist attacks, acts of war or natural disasters may affect any market for our common stock, impact the businesses in which we invest and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.. Terrorist attacks, acts of war or natural disasters may disrupt our operations, as well as the operations of the businesses in which we invest.  These events have created, and continue to create, economic and political uncertainties and have contributed to global economic instability.  Future terrorist activities, military or security operations, or natural disasters could further weaken the domestic or global economy.  These events could create additional uncertainties, which may negatively impact the businesses in which we invest directly or indirectly and, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.  Losses from terrorist attacks and natural disasters are generally uninsurable.. We may be negatively affected by securities litigation or shareholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense and impact our results of operations.. We may be the target of securities litigation in the future, particularly if the trading price of our common stock and our debt securities fluctuates significantly. We could also generally be subject to litigation, including derivative actions by our shareholders or shareholder activism for a variety of other reasons. Any litigation or shareholder activism may result in substantial costs and divert management's and our Board of Directors' attention and resources from our business.  Significant legal fees and other expenses may cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENTS. Our investments in portfolio companies involve a number of significant risks:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPortfolio companies are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of key employees.  Therefore, the death, disability, resignation, termination, or significant under-performance of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on our portfolio company and, in turn, on us..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPortfolio companies may have unpredictable operating results, could become parties to litigation, may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tMost of our portfolio companies are private companies. Private companies may not have readily publicly available information about their businesses, operations and financial condition. Consequently, we rely on the ability of our management team and investment professionals to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential returns from making investments in these portfolio companies.  If we are unable to uncover all material information about the target portfolio company, we may not make a fully informed investment decision and may lose all or part of our investment..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPortfolio companies may have shorter operating histories, narrower product lines, smaller market shares and/or more significant customer concentration than larger businesses, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors' actions and market conditions, as well as general economic downturns..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPortfolio companies may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their debt instruments that we hold, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of us realizing any guarantees from subsidiaries or affiliates of our portfolio companies that we may have obtained in connection with our investment, as well as a corresponding decrease in the value of the equity components of our investments.. In addition, in the course of providing significant managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies, certain of our officers and directors may serve as directors on the boards of these companies. To the extent that litigation arises out of our investments in these companies, our officers and directors may be named as defendants in such litigation, which could result in an expenditure of funds for claims in excess of our directors' and officers' insurance coverage (through our indemnification of our officers and directors) and the diversion of management's time and resources.. 32. Table of Contents. The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.. We invest, and will continue to invest, in portfolio companies whose securities are not publicly traded. These securities are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or will otherwise be less liquid than publicly traded securities. As a result, we do not expect to achieve liquidity in our investments in the near-term. The illiquidity of these investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded these investments and, as a result, we may suffer losses.. Defaults by our portfolio companies could harm our operating results.. Portfolio companies may fail to satisfy financial, operating or other covenants imposed by us or other lenders, which could lead to a default and, potentially, acceleration of its loans and foreclosure on its secured assets.  These events could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize the portfolio company's ability to meet its obligations, including under the debt or equity securities we hold.  We may also incur expenses to the extent necessary to recover upon a default or to negotiate new terms with the defaulting portfolio company.. Our investments in equity securities involve a substantial degree of risk.. We may purchase common stock and other equity securities, including warrants. Although equity securities have historically generated higher average total returns than fixed-income securities over the long term, equity securities have also experienced significantly more volatility in those returns. The equity securities we acquire may fail to appreciate and may decline in value or become worthless, and our ability to recover our investment depends on our portfolio company's success. Investments in equity securities involve a number of significant risks, including the risk of further dilution as a result of additional issuances, inability to access additional capital and failure to pay current distributions. Investments in preferred securities involve special risks, such as the risk of deferred distributions, credit risk, illiquidity and limited voting rights.. We may not realize gains from our equity investments.. Certain investments that we have made in the past and may make in the future include warrants or other equity securities. Investments in equity securities involve a number of significant risks, including the risk of further dilution as a result of additional issuances, inability to access additional capital and failure to pay current distributions. Investments in preferred securities involve special risks, such as the risk of deferred distributions, credit risk, illiquidity and limited voting rights. In addition, we may from time to time make non-control, equity investments in portfolio companies. Our goal is ultimately to realize gains upon our disposition of these equity interests. However, the equity interests we receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience. We also may be unable to realize any value if a portfolio company does not have a liquidity event, such as a sale of the business, recapitalization or public offering, which would allow us to sell the underlying equity interests. We often seek puts or similar rights to give us the right to sell our equity securities back to the portfolio company issuer; however, we may be unable to exercise these put rights for the consideration provided in our investment documents if the issuer is in financial distress.. Prepayments of our debt investments by our portfolio companies could adversely impact our results of operations and reduce our return on equity.. From time to time, certain portfolio companies may prepay our debt investments in our portfolio companies prior to maturity, the specific timing of which we do not control. When this occurs, we will generally reinvest these proceeds in temporary investments, pending their future investment in new portfolio companies. These temporary investments will typically have substantially lower yields than the debt being prepaid and we could experience significant delays in reinvesting these amounts. Any future investment in a new portfolio company may also be at lower yields than the debt that was repaid. As a result, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if one or more of our portfolio companies elect to prepay amounts owed to us. Additionally, prepayments could negatively impact our return on equity, which could result in a decline in the market price of our securities.. 33. Table of Contents. Changes in interest rates may affect our cost of capital, the value of investments and net investment income.. Some of our debt investments will bear interest at variable rates and the interest income from these investments could be negatively affected by decreases in market interest rates. In addition, an increase in interest rates would make it more expensive for us to use debt to finance our investments. As a result, a significant increase in market interest rates could increase our cost of capital, which would reduce our net investment income. Also, an increase in interest rates available to investors could make an investment in our securities less attractive than alternative investments, a situation which could reduce the value of our securities. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates may have an adverse impact on our returns by requiring us to seek lower yields on our debt investments and by increasing the risk that our portfolio companies will prepay our debt investments, resulting in the need to redeploy capital at potentially lower rates. A decrease in market interest rates may also adversely impact our returns on temporary investments, which would reduce our net investment income.  In addition, certain of our debt investments and debt liabilities may bear interest at fixed rates.  To the extent that our fixed rate assets and liabilities are not perfectly hedged, our net investment income may decrease based on changes in market interest rates.  An increase in market interest rates may also decrease the fair value of our fixed rate investments, as these may be less attractive securities in a rising rate environment.. There may be circumstances in which our debt investments could be subordinated to claims of other creditors or we could be subject to lender liability claims.. Even though we may have structured certain of our investments as secured loans, if one of our portfolio companies were to go bankrupt, depending on the facts and circumstances, and based upon principles of equitable subordination as defined by existing case law, a bankruptcy court could subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors and transfer any lien securing our subordinated claim to the bankruptcy estate. The principles of equitable subordination defined by case law have generally indicated that a claim may be subordinated only if its holder is guilty of misconduct or where the senior loan is re-characterized as an equity investment and the senior lender has actually provided significant managerial assistance to the bankrupt debtor. We may also be subject to lender liability claims for actions taken by us with respect to a borrower's business or instances where we exercise control over the borrower. It is possible that we could become subject to a lender's liability claim, including as a result of actions taken in rendering significant managerial assistance or actions to compel and collect payments from the borrower outside the ordinary course of business.. As a Regulated Investment Company, we may have certain regulatory restrictions that could preclude us from making additional investments in our portfolio companies.. We may not have the ability to make additional investments in our portfolio companies.  After our initial investment in a portfolio company, we may be called upon from time to time to provide additional funds to that company or have the opportunity to increase our investment or make follow-on investments.  Any decisions not to make a follow-on investment or any inability on our part to make such an investment may have a negative impact on a portfolio company in need of such an investment, may result in a missed opportunity for us to increase our participation in a successful operation or may reduce the expected return on the investment.. Changes relating to LIBOR may adversely affect the value of the LIBOR-indexed, floating-rate debt securities in our portfolio.. In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. As of March 31, 2018, approximately 92.1% of our debt investment portfolio (at fair value) bore interest rates indexed upon LIBOR. Additionally, our Credit Facility accrues interest at the applicable LIBOR rate plus 3.00%, with a step-down to LIBOR plus 2.75% at the time our net worth exceeds $325 million. The use of the new index could reduce our interest income or increase our interest expense and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Management continues to monitor the status and discussions regarding LIBOR.. We generally will not control our portfolio companies.. We do not,  and do not expect to, control most of our portfolio companies, even though we may have board representation or board observation rights, and our debt agreements may contain certain restrictive covenants. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company in which we invest may make business decisions with which we disagree, and the management of such company, as representatives of the holders of their common equity, may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests as debt investors. Due to the lack of liquidity for our investments in. 34. Table of Contents. non-traded companies, we may not be able to dispose of our interests in our portfolio companies as readily as we would like or at an appropriate valuation. As a result, a portfolio company may make decisions that could decrease the value of our portfolio holdings.. Second priority liens on collateral securing loans that we make to our portfolio companies may be subject to control by senior creditors with first priority liens. Further, in cases where we invest in unsecured subordinated debt, we would not have any lien on the collateral. In each of these cases, if there is a default, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to repay in full both the first priority creditors and us.. Certain loans that we make are either secured by a second priority security interest in the same collateral pledged by a portfolio company to secure senior debt owed by the portfolio company to commercial banks or other traditional lenders, or in the case of unsecured subordinated debt, we have no lien at all on the assets. Often the senior lender has procured covenants from the portfolio company prohibiting the incurrence of additional secured debt without the senior lender's consent. Prior to and as a condition of permitting the portfolio company to borrow money from us secured by the same collateral pledged to the senior lender, or in the case where we invest in unsecured subordinated debt, the senior lender will require assurances that it will control the disposition of any collateral in the event of bankruptcy or other default. In many cases, the senior lender will require us to enter into an \"intercreditor agreement\" prior to permitting the portfolio company to borrow from us. Typically the intercreditor agreements we are requested to execute expressly subordinate our debt instruments to those held by the senior lender and further provide that the senior lender shall control: (1) the commencement of foreclosure or other proceedings to liquidate and collect on the collateral, subject to a negotiated \"standstill period\" after which we can initiate; (2) the nature, timing and conduct of foreclosure or other collection proceedings, subject to a negotiated \"standstill period\" after which we can initiate; (3) the amendment of any collateral document; (4) the release of the security interests in respect of any collateral; and (5) the waiver of defaults under any security agreement. Because of the control we may cede to senior lenders under intercreditor agreements we may enter, we may be unable to realize the proceeds of any collateral securing some of our loans.. Our portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments in those companies.. We invest primarily in the secured term debt of middle market companies and equity issued by middle market companies. Our portfolio companies may have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the debt in which we invest. By their terms, these debt instruments may entitle the holders to receive payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments with respect to the debt instruments in which we invest. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution. After repaying its senior creditors, the portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of debt ranking equally with debt instruments in which we invest, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant portfolio company.. RISKS RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.. The market price of our common stock will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. Our common stock is intended for long-term investors and should not be treated as a trading vehicle. The market price and liquidity of the market for shares of our common stock may be significantly affected by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. These factors include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of BDCs or other companies in our sector, which is not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texclusion of our common stock from certain market indices, such as the Russell 2000 Financial Services Index, which could reduce the ability of certain investment funds to own our common stock and put short-term selling pressure on our common stock;. 35. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in regulatory policies or tax guidelines, particularly with respect to RICs or BDCs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of RIC tax treatment;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour origination activity, including the pace of, and competition for, new investment opportunities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges or perceived changes in earnings or variations of operating results;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges or perceived changes in the value of our portfolio of investments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany shortfall in revenue or net income or any increase in losses from levels expected by investors or securities analysts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential future sales of common stock or debt securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock or the conversion of such securities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdeparture of our key personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toperating performance of companies comparable to us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic trends and other external factors; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of a major funding source.. Investing in shares of our common stock may involve an above average degree of risk.. The investments we make in accordance with our investment objectives may result in a higher amount of risk, volatility or loss of principal than alternative investment options. Our investments in portfolio companies may be highly speculative, and therefore, an investment in our common stock may not be suitable for investors with lower risk tolerance.. Our common stock often trades at a discount from NAV.. Our common stock is listed on Nasdaq.  Shareholders desiring liquidity may sell their shares on Nasdaq at current market value, which has often been below NAV.  Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at discounts from NAV, which is a risk separate and distinct from the risk that a fund's performance will cause its NAV to decrease. We cannot predict whether our common stock will trade at, above or below NAV. In addition, if our common stock trades below our NAV per share, we will generally not be able to issue additional common stock at the market price unless our shareholders approve such a sale and our Board of Directors make certain determinations.. The trading market or market value of our publicly issued debt securities may be volatile.. The trading market for our publicly issued debt securities may from time to time be significantly affected by numerous factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCreditworthiness;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tTerms, including, but not limited to, maturity, principal amount, redemption, and repayment of convertible features;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tMarket and economic conditions; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDemand for our debt securities.. 36. Table of Contents. In addition, credit rating assessments by third parties regarding our ability to pay our obligations will generally affect the market value of our debt securities.. We currently intend to pay quarterly dividends. However, in the future we may not pay any dividends depending on a variety of factors.. While we intend to pay dividends to our shareholders out of taxable income available for distribution, there can be no assurance that we will do so. Any dividends that we do pay may be payable in cash, in our stock, or in stock in any of our holdings or in a combination of all three. All dividends will be paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our financial condition, maintenance of our RIC status, and compliance with applicable BDC regulations.. We currently pay dividends in cash. However, in the future we may choose to pay dividends in our own stock, in which case you may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash you receive.. We may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our stock.  Under certain applicable provisions of the Code and the Treasury regulations, distributions payable by us in cash or in shares of stock (at the shareholders election) would satisfy the annual distribution requirement for a RIC. The IRS has issued a revenue procedure providing that a dividend payable in stock or in cash at the election of the shareholders will be treated as a taxable dividend eligible for the dividends paid deduction provided that at least 20% of the total dividend is payable in cash and certain other requirements are satisfied. Taxable shareholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income (or as long-term capital gain to the extent such dividend is properly reported as a capital gain dividend) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. shareholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of any cash received.  If a U.S. shareholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale.  Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. shareholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividends payable in stock.  If a significant number of our shareholders determine to sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our stock..
