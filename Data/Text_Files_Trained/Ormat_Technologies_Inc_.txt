[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our business, operating results or financial condition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.. Concentration of customers may expose us to heightened financial exposure.. We often rely on single customers at our facilities, exposing such facilities to financial risks if any customer should fail to perform its obligations.. Our businesses often rely on a single customer to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility’s output. The financial performance of these facilities depends on such customer continuing to perform its obligations under the long-term agreement. A facility’s financial results could be materially and adversely affected if any of our customer fails to fulfill its contractual obligations and we are unable to find other customers to produce the same level of profitability. We cannot assure that such performance failures by third parties will not occur, or that if they do occur, such failures will not adversely affect the cash flows or profitability of our businesses.. For example, we are exposed to the credit and financial condition of SCPPA and its municipal utility members, as customers that buy the output from six of our geothermal power plant. Because our contracts with SCPPA are long-term, we may be adversely affected if the credit quality of any of these customers were to decline or if their respective financial conditions were to deteriorate or if they are otherwise unable to perform their obligations under our long-term contracts.. A significant portion of our Product segment revenues are concentrated in one region and expose us to regional economic or market declines.. A significant portion of our Product segment revenues are concentrated in Turkey and rely on the continued geothermal development growth and government support for geothermal development in the country. Adverse political developments in the relationship between Turkey and the U.S., adverse economic developments in this region or a decline in government support for the development of geothermal power in the country could materially and adversely affect regional demand for the geothermal equipment and services we provide in the Turkish market or the prices we may charge for such equipment and services, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our Product segment profit margins and, consequently, our business, financial condition, future results and cash flows.. Our financial performance depends on the successful operation of our geothermal power and REG plants, which is subject to various operational risks.. Our financial performance depends on the successful operation of our subsidiaries’ geothermal and REG power plants. In connection with such operations, we derived approximately 67.6% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 from the sale of electricity. The cost of operation and maintenance and the operating performance of our subsidiaries’ geothermal power and REG plants may be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including some that are discussed elsewhere in these risk factors and the following:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregular and unexpected maintenance and replacement expenditures;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshutdowns due to the breakdown or failure of our equipment or the equipment of the transmission serving utility;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlabor disputes;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe presence of hazardous materials on our power plant sites;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontinued availability of cooling water supply;. 77. Table of Contents. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcatastrophic events such as fires, explosions, earthquakes, volcanic activity, landslides, floods, releases of hazardous materials, severe weather storms, or similar occurrences affecting our power plants or any of the power purchasers or other third parties providing services to our power plants; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe aging of power plants (which may reduce their availability and increase the cost of their maintenance).. Any of these events could significantly increase the expenses incurred by our power plants or reduce the overall generating capacity of our power plants and could significantly reduce or entirely eliminate the revenues generated by one or more of our power plants, which in turn would reduce our net income and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. As mentioned above, the aging of our power plants may reduce their availability and increase maintenance costs due to the need to repair or replace our equipment.. Our exploration, development, and operation of geothermal energy resources are subject to geological risks and uncertainties, which may result in decreased performance or increased costs for our power plants.. Our primary business involves the exploration, development, and operation of geothermal energy resources. These activities are subject to uncertainties that, in certain respects, are similar to those typically associated with oil and gas exploration, development, and exploitation, such as dry holes, uncontrolled releases, and pressure and temperature decline. Any of these uncertainties may increase our capital expenditures and our operating costs, or reduce the efficiency of our power plants. We may not find geothermal resources capable of supporting a commercially viable power plant at exploration sites where we have conducted tests, acquired land rights, and drilled test wells, which would adversely affect our development of geothermal power plants. Further, since the commencement of their operations, several of our power plants have experienced geothermal resource cooling, uncontrolled flow and/or reservoir pressure decline in the normal course of operations. Because geothermal reservoirs are complex geological structures, we can only estimate their geographic area and sustainable output. The viability of geothermal power plants depends on different factors directly related to the geothermal resource (such as the temperature, pressure, storage capacity, transmissivity, and recharge) as well as operational factors relating to the extraction or reinjection of geothermal fluids. For example, at our North Brawley power plant, instability of the sands and clay in the geothermal resource and variability in the chemical composition of the geothermal fluid have all combined to increase our capital expenditures for the plant, as well as our ongoing operating expenses, and have so far prevented the plant from operation at its intended design capacity. Another example is the Sarulla project, where we are both an equity investor and equipment supplier, which has experienced delays and budget cost overruns in the drilling program. Our geothermal energy power plants may also suffer an unexpected decline in the capacity of their respective geothermal wells and are exposed to a risk of geothermal reservoirs not being sufficient for sustained generation of the electrical power capacity desired over time.. Another aspect of geothermal operations is the management and stabilization of subsurface impacts caused by fluid injection pressures of production and injection fluids to mitigate subsidence. In the case of the geothermal resource supplying the Heber complex, pressure drawdown in the center of the well field has caused some localized ground subsidence, while pressure in the peripheral areas has caused localized ground inflation. Inflation and subsidence, if not controlled, can adversely affect farming operations and other infrastructure at or near the land surface. Potential costs, which cannot be estimated and may be significant, of failing to stabilize site pressures in the Heber complex area include repair and modification of gravity-based farm irrigation systems and municipal sewer piping and possible repair or replacement of a local road bridge spanning an irrigation canal.. Additionally, active geothermal areas, such as the areas in which our power plants are located, are subject to frequent low-level seismic disturbances, volcanic eruptions and lava flows. Serious seismic disturbances, volcanic eruptions and lava flows are possible and could result in damage to our power plants (or transmission lines used by customers who buy electricity from us) or equipment or degrade the quality of our geothermal resources to such an extent that we could not perform under the PPA for the affected power plant, which in turn could reduce our net income and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow. If we suffer a serious seismic disturbance, volcanic eruptions and lava flows, our business interruption and property damage insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses sustained as a result thereof. In addition, insurance coverage may not continue to be available in the future in amounts adequate to insure against such seismic disturbances, volcanic eruptions and lava flows.. Furthermore, absent additional geologic/hydrologic studies, any increase in power generation from our geothermal power plants, failure to reinject the geothermal fluid or improper maintenance of the hydrological balance may affect the operational duration of the geothermal resource and cause it to decline in value over time, and may adversely affect our ability to generate power from the relevant geothermal power plant.. 78. Table of Contents. Reduced levels of recovered energy required for the operation of our REG power plants may result in decreased performance of such power plants.. Our REG power plants generate electricity from recovered energy or so-called “waste heat” that is generated as a residual by-product of gas turbine-driven compressor stations and a variety of industrial processes. Any interruption in the supply of the recovered energy source, such as a result of reduced gas flows in the pipelines or reduced level of operation at the compressor stations, or in the output levels of the various industrial processes, may cause an unexpected decline in the capacity and performance of our recovered energy power plants.. Our business development activities may not be successful and our projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled.. We are in the process of developing and constructing a number of new power plants. Our success in developing a particular project is contingent upon, among other things, negotiation of satisfactory engineering and construction agreements and obtaining PPAs and transmission services agreements, receipt of required governmental permits, obtaining adequate financing, and the timely implementation and satisfactory completion of field development, testing and power plant construction and commissioning. We may be unsuccessful in accomplishing any of these matters or doing so on a timely basis. Although we may attempt to minimize the financial risks attributable to the development of a project by securing a favorable PPA and applicable transmission services agreements, obtaining all required governmental permits and approvals and arranging, in certain cases, adequate financing prior to the commencement of construction, the development of a power project may require us to incur significant expenses for preliminary engineering, permitting and legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being financed.. Currently, we have geothermal projects and prospects under exploration, development or construction in the U.S., Kenya, Guatemala, Guadeloupe, New Zealand, Honduras, Indonesia and Ethiopia, and we intend to pursue the expansion of some of our existing plants and the development of other new plants. Our completion of these facilities is subject to substantial risks, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinability to secure a PPA;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinability to secure transmission services agreements;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinability to secure the required financing;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcost increases and delays due to unanticipated shortages of adequate resources to execute the project such as equipment, material and labor;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twork stoppages resulting from force majeure event including riots, strikes and whether conditions;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinability to obtain permits, licenses and other regulatory approvals;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure to secure sufficient land positions for the wellfield, power plant and rights of way;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure by key contractors and vendors to timely and properly perform, including where we use equipment manufactured by others;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure by key suppliers to provide steam for electricity generation, including at the Menengai project in Kenya.. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinability to secure or delays in securing the required transmission line and/or capacity;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse environmental and geological conditions (including inclement weather conditions);. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse local business law; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour attention to other projects and activities, including those in the solar energy and energy storage sectors.. Any one of these could give rise to delays, cost overruns, the termination of the plant expansion, construction or development or the loss (total or partial) of our interest in the project under development, construction, or expansion.. 79. Table of Contents. We rely on power transmission facilities that we do not own or control.. We depend on transmission facilities owned and operated by others to deliver the power we sell from our power plants to our customers. If transmission is disrupted, or if the transmission capacity infrastructure is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver power to our customers may be adversely impacted and we may either incur additional costs or forego revenues. In addition, lack of access to new transmission capacity may affect our ability to develop new projects. Existing congestion of transmission capacity, as well as expansion of transmission systems and competition from other developers seeking access to expanded systems, could also affect our performance.. We may be unable to obtain the financing we need to pursue our growth strategy and any future financing we receive may be less favorable to us than our current financing arrangements, either of which may adversely affect our ability to expand our operations.. Most of our geothermal power plants generally have been financed using leveraged financing structures, consisting of non-recourse or limited recourse debt obligations. Each of our projects under development or construction and those projects and businesses we may seek to acquire or construct will require substantial capital investment. Our continued access to capital on acceptable terms is necessary for the success of our growth strategy. Our attempts to obtain future financings may not be successful or on favorable terms.. Market conditions and other factors may not permit future project and acquisition financings on terms similar to those our subsidiaries have previously received. Our ability to arrange for financing on a substantially non-recourse or limited recourse basis, and the costs of such financing, are dependent on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, conditions in the global capital and credit markets, investor confidence, the continued success of current power plants, the credit quality of the power plants being financed, the political situation in the country where the power plant is located, and the continued existence of tax and securities laws which are conducive to raising capital. If we are not able to obtain financing for our power plants on a substantially non-recourse or limited recourse basis, we may have to finance them using recourse capital such as direct equity investments or the incurrence of additional debt by us.. Also, in the absence of favorable financing options, we may decide not to build new plants or acquire facilities from third parties. Any of these alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects.. We may also need additional financing to implement our strategic plan. For example, our cash flow from operations and existing liquidity facilities may not be adequate to finance any acquisitions we may want to pursue or new technologies we may want to develop or acquire. Financing for acquisitions or technology development activities may not be available on the non-recourse or limited recourse basis we have historically used for our business, or on other terms we find acceptable.. Our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments.. We have sold minority equity interests in four of our consolidated subsidiaries, through which we hold a large number of our domestic geothermal power plants and recovered energy generation plants, to different third parties and we have partners that hold a minority equity interest in our geothermal power plant in Guadeloupe. We may continue in the future to develop and/or acquire and/or hold properties in joint ventures with other entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures. Ownership of assets in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decision-making authority, which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes, including litigation or arbitration;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour joint venture partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment objectives, including the timing, terms and strategies for any investments in the projects that are owned by the joint ventures, which could affect decisions about future capital expenditures, major operational expenditures and retirement of assets, among other things;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted and the market for our interest may be limited;. 80. Table of Contents. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes, and this could impact our ability to fully take advantage of federal tax incentives available for renewable energy projects;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour joint venture partners might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner, which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets and investments in companies that compete directly or indirectly with us that could create conflict of interest issues.. Our international operations expose us to risks related to the application of foreign laws, taxes, economic conditions, labor supply and relations, political conditions, and policies of foreign governments, any of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. We have substantial operations outside of the U.S., both in our Electricity segment and our Product segment. Our foreign operations are subject to regulation by various foreign governments and regulatory authorities and are subject to the application of foreign laws. Such foreign laws or regulations may not provide the same type of legal certainty and rights, in connection with our contractual relationships in such countries, as are afforded to our operations in the U.S., which may adversely affect our ability to receive revenues or enforce our rights in connection with our foreign operations. Furthermore, existing laws or regulations may be amended or repealed, and new laws or regulations may be enacted or issued. In addition, the laws and regulations of some countries may limit our ability to hold a majority interest in some of the power plants that we may develop or acquire, thus limiting our ability to control the development, construction and operation of such power plants, or our ability to import our products into such countries. Our foreign operations are also subject to significant political, economic and financial risks, which vary by country, and include:. •  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in government policies or personnel;. •  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in general economic conditions;. •  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions on currency transfer or convertibility;. •  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in labor relations;. •  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical instability and civil unrest;. •  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the local electricity and/or geothermal markets;. •  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbreach or repudiation of important contractual undertakings by governmental entities; and. •  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpropriation and confiscation of assets and facilities.. In particular, with respect to our Electricity segment, in Guatemala the electricity sector was partially privatized, and it is currently unclear whether further privatization will occur in the future. Such developments may affect our Amatitlan and Zunil power plants if, for example, they result in changes to the prevailing tariff regime or in the identity and creditworthiness of our power purchasers. In Kenya, any break-up or potential privatization of KPLC, the power purchase for our power plants located in Kenya, may adversely affect our Olkaria III complex. Although we generally obtain political risk insurance in connection with our foreign power plants, such political risk insurance does not mitigate all of the above-mentioned risks. In addition, insurance proceeds received pursuant to our political risk insurance policies, where applicable, may not be adequate to cover all losses sustained as a result of any covered risks and may at times be pledged in favor of the power plant lenders as collateral. Also, insurance may not be available in the future with the scope of coverage and in amounts of coverage adequate to insure against such risks and disturbances.. With respect to our Product segment, since we primarily engage in sales in those markets where there is a geothermal reservoir, any such change might adversely affect geothermal developers in those markets and, subsequently, the ability of such developers to purchase our products. In Turkey, we are involved as a major equipment supplier in a significant number of projects that are currently under construction. We have faced, and anticipate that we will continue to face, obstacles in the Turkish market that may materially and adversely affect our future business and operations in Turkey, including the recent failed coup, devaluation of the Turkish Lira, a general slowdown in the Turkish economy and an inability to obtain project and bank financing on terms acceptable to us, together with political uncertainties, all of which are causing our cost of revenues in Turkey to increase.. 81. Table of Contents. Any or all of the changes discussed above could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. Our foreign power plants and foreign manufacturing operations expose us to risks related to fluctuations in currency rates, which may reduce our profits from such power plants and operations.. Risks attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates can arise when any of our foreign subsidiaries borrow funds or incur operating or other expenses in one type of currency but receive revenues in another. In such cases, an adverse change in exchange rates can reduce such subsidiary’s ability to meet its debt service obligations, reduce the amount of cash and income we receive from such foreign subsidiary or increase such subsidiary’s overall expenses. In addition, the imposition by foreign governments of restrictions on the transfer of foreign currency abroad, or restrictions on the conversion of local currency into foreign currency, would have an adverse effect on the operations of our foreign power plants and foreign manufacturing operations, and may limit or diminish the amount of cash and income that we receive from such foreign power plants and operations.. A significant portion of our electricity revenues is attributed to payments made by power purchasers under PPAs. The failure of any such power purchaser to perform its obligations under the relevant PPA or the loss of a PPA due to a default would reduce our net income and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. A significant portion of our revenues is attributable to electricity our power plants sell to power purchasers under the relevant PPAs. There is a risk that any one or more of the power purchasers may not fulfill their respective payment obligations under their PPAs. If any of the power purchasers fails to meet its payment obligations under its PPA(s), such failure could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. Storage projects that we are currently developing or plan to develop in the future may operate as \"merchant\" facilities without long-term power sales agreements for some or all of their generating capacity and output and therefore such projects will be exposed to market fluctuations.. Storage projects that we are currently developing or plan to develop in the future may operate as \"merchant\" facilities without long-term sales agreements for some or all of their generating capacity and output and therefore such projects will be exposed to market fluctuations.  Without the benefit of long-term sales agreements for these assets, we cannot be sure that we will be able to sell any or all of the power and ancillary services generated by these facilities at commercially attractive rates or that these facilities will be able to operate profitably. This could lead to future impairments of our property, plant and equipment or to the closing of certain of our storage facilities, resulting in economic losses and liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.. Seasonal variations may cause fluctuations in our cash flows, which may cause the market price of our common stock to fall in certain periods.. Our results of operations are subject to seasonal variations. This is primarily because some of our power plants may experience reduced generation during warm periods due to the lower heat differential between the geothermal fluid and the ambient surroundings. Some of our domestic power plants receive higher capacity payments under the relevant PPAs during the summer months, and due to the generally higher time-of-use energy factor during the summer months. Such seasonal variations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow. If our operating results fall below the public’s or analysts’ expectations in some future period or periods, the market price of our common stock will likely fall in such period or periods.. Pursuant to the terms of some of our PPAs with investor-owned electric utilities and publicly-owned electric utilities in states that have renewable portfolio standards, the failure to supply the contracted capacity and energy thereunder may result in the imposition of penalties.. Pursuant to the terms of certain of our PPAs, we may be required to make payments to the relevant power purchaser under certain conditions, such as shortfall in delivery of renewable energy and energy credits, and not meeting certain performance threshold requirements, as defined in the relevant PPA. The amount of payment required is dependent upon the level of shortfall in delivery or performance requirements and is recorded in the period the shortfall occurs. In addition, if we do not meet certain minimum performance requirements, the capacity of the relevant power plant may be permanently reduced. Any or all of these considerations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. 82. Table of Contents. The Energy Choice Initiative (ECI), a pending amendment to the Constitution of the State of Nevada, may permit our customer to terminate its PPAs with us.. The ECI is a proposed amendment to the Constitution of the State of Nevada that would require the Nevada Legislature to adopt new statutes or amend existing statutes in order to establish an open and competitive retail electricity market and prevent the concentration of the electricity generation market among only a few generators of electricity. This ballot question passed with over 72% of Nevada voters in favor in November 2016, and if it passes again in November 2018, the Nevada Legislature will be required to amend state law in the manner described above by no later than 2023.. It is unclear what impact the ECI would have on our existing PPAs and the Nevada RPS. NV Energy, the offtaker of our Brady, SB Complex, Tuscarora, Jersey Valley and McGinness Hills power plants, is taking the position that the ECI would require the termination of our existing PPAs and potentially the termination of the RPS. Whether existing PPAs could be terminated will remain unclear until the scope of the Nevada Legislature’s implementation of the ECI becomes known. If the Nevada Legislature adopts any new laws pursuant to the ECI that terminate or require the termination of, our existing PPAs with NV Energy, we could lose significant amounts of revenue derived from the sale of electricity to NV Energy under such PPAs which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. The SRAC for our power purchasers may decline, which would reduce our power plant revenues and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. Under two of the PPAs for our power plants in California, the price that Southern California Edison pays is based upon its SRAC, which are the incremental costs that it would have incurred had it generated the relevant electricity itself or purchased such electricity from others. Under settlement agreements between Southern California Edison and a number of power generators in California that are Qualifying Facilities, including our subsidiaries, the energy price component payable by Southern California Edison was fixed through April 2012, but since then is based on Southern California Edison’s SRAC, as determined by the CPUC. The SRAC may vary substantially on a monthly basis, and are expected to be based primarily on natural gas prices for gas delivered to California as well as other factors. The levels of SRAC prices paid by Southern California Edison may decline following the expiration date of the settlement agreements, which in turn would reduce our power plant revenues derived from Southern California Edison under our PPAs and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. Under the terms of a global settlement approved by CPUC (Global Settlement) SRAC for our Heber 2 and Mammoth G2 PPAs are tied to a formula with energy market heat rates. The Global Settlement further provides that after July 1, 2015 if the term of any of the PPAs we have for these power plants expires, Southern California Edison would have no obligation to purchase power from any of these plants that has a generating capacity in excess of 20 MW, which would apply to the PPAs for our Heber 2 power plant (37 MW contract capacity) with Southern California Edison. Our Mammoth G2 plant (10.5 MW contract capacity) will be entitled to a new standard offer PPA, with SRAC pricing and capacity payments as determined from time to time by the CPUC. The joint parties to the Global Settlement agreed that the utilities can request from FERC a waiver of the mandatory purchase obligation under PURPA for Qualifying Facilities above 20 MW and FERC has granted such waiver for these California utilities.. If any of our domestic power plants loses its current Qualifying Facility status under PURPA, or if amendments to PURPA are enacted that substantially reduce the benefits currently afforded to Qualifying Facilities, our domestic operations could be adversely affected.. Most of our domestic power plants are Qualifying Facilities pursuant to PURPA, which largely exempts the power plants from the FPA, and certain state and local laws and regulations regarding rates and financial and organizational requirements for electric utilities.. 83. Table of Contents. If any of our domestic power plants were to lose its Qualifying Facility status, such power plant could become subject to the full scope of the FPA and applicable state regulation. The application of the FPA and other applicable state regulation to our domestic power plants could require our operations to comply with an increasingly complex regulatory regime that may be costly and greatly reduce our operational flexibility.. If a domestic power plant were to lose its Qualifying Facility status, it would become subject to full regulation as a public utility under the FPA, and the rates charged by such power plant pursuant to its PPAs would be subject to the review and approval of FERC. FERC, upon such review, may determine that the rates currently set forth in such PPAs are not appropriate and may set rates that are lower than the rates currently charged. In addition, FERC may require that the affected domestic power plant refund amounts previously paid by the relevant power purchaser to such power plant. Even if a power plant does not lose its Qualifying Facility status, pursuant to regulations issued by FERC for Qualifying Facility power plants above 20 MW, if a power plant’s PPA is terminated or otherwise expires, and the subsequent sales are not made pursuant to a state’s implementation of PURPA, that power plant will become subject to FERC’s ratemaking jurisdiction under the FPA. Moreover, a loss of Qualifying Facility status also could permit the power purchaser, pursuant to the terms of the particular PPA, to cease taking and paying for electricity from the relevant power plant or, consistent with FERC precedent, to seek refunds of past amounts paid. This could cause the loss of some or all of our revenues payable pursuant to the related PPAs, result in significant liability for refunds of past amounts paid, or otherwise impair the value of our power plants. If a power purchaser were to cease taking and paying for electricity or seek to obtain refunds of past amounts paid, there can be no assurance that the costs incurred in connection with the power plant could be recovered through sales to other purchasers or that we would have sufficient funds to make such payments. In addition, the loss of Qualifying Facility status would be an event of default under the financing arrangements currently in place for some of our power plants, which would enable the lenders to exercise their remedies and enforce the liens on the relevant power plant.. Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC also has the authority to prospectively lift the mandatory obligation of a utility under PURPA to offer to purchase the electricity from a Qualifying Facility if the utility operates in a workably competitive market. Our existing PPAs between a Qualifying Facility and a utility are not affected. If, in addition to the California utilities’ waiver of the mandatory purchase obligation for QF projects that exceed 20 MW described in the risk factor above, the utilities in the other regions in which our domestic power plants operate were to be relieved of the mandatory purchase obligation, they would not be required to purchase energy from the power plant in the region under Federal law upon termination of the existing PPA or with respect to new power plants, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow. Moreover, FERC has the authority to modify its regulations relating to the utility’s mandatory purchase obligation under PURPA, which could result in the reduction in the purchase obligation of California and other utilities to a level below 20 MW, or the elimination of the purchase obligation. If that were to occur it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. The reduction or elimination of government incentives could adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flows.. Construction and operation of our geothermal power plants and recovered energy-based power plants has benefited, and may benefit in the future, from public policies and government incentives that support renewable energy and enhance the economic feasibility of these projects in regions and countries where we operate. Such policies and incentives include PTCs and ITCs, accelerated depreciation tax benefits, renewable portfolio standards, carbon trading mechanisms, rebates, and mandated feed-in-tariffs, and may include similar or other incentives to end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of geothermal, solar and other power products. Some of these measures have been implemented at the federal level, while others have been implemented by different states within the U.S. or countries outside the U.S. where we operate.. The availability and continuation of these public policies and government incentives have a significant effect on the economics and viability of our development program and continued construction of new geothermal, recovered energy-based, Solar PV power plants and, recently, energy storage projects. Any changes to such public policies, or any reduction in or elimination or expiration of such government incentives could affect us in different ways. For example, any reduction in, termination or expiration of renewable portfolio standards may result in less demand for generation from our geothermal and recovered energy-based, power plants. Any reductions in, termination or expiration of other government incentives could reduce the economic viability of, and cause us to reduce, the construction of new geothermal, recovered energy-based, Solar PV or any other power plants. Similarly, any such changes that affect the geothermal energy industry in a manner that is different from other sources of renewable energy, such as wind or solar, may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses engaged in the development, construction and operation of renewable power projects using such other resources. Any of the foregoing outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, future results, and cash flows.. 84. Table of Contents. Our financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in the legal and regulatory environment affecting our power plants.. All of our power plants are subject to extensive regulation, and therefore changes in applicable laws or regulations, or interpretations of those laws and regulations, could result in increased compliance costs, the need for additional capital expenditures or the reduction of certain benefits currently available to our power plants. The structure of domestic and foreign federal, state and local energy regulation currently is, and may continue to be, subject to challenges, modifications, the imposition of additional regulatory requirements, and restructuring proposals. We or our power purchasers may not be able to obtain all regulatory approvals that may be required in the future, or any necessary modifications to existing regulatory approvals, or maintain all required regulatory approvals. In addition, the cost of operation and maintenance and the operating performance of geothermal power plants may be adversely affected by changes in certain laws and regulations, including tax laws.. Any changes to applicable laws and regulations could significantly increase the regulatory-related compliance and other expenses incurred by the power plants and could significantly reduce or entirely eliminate the revenues generated by one or more of the power plants, which in turn would reduce our net income and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. The costs of compliance with environmental laws and of obtaining and maintaining environmental permits and governmental approvals required for construction and/or operation may increase in the future and these costs (as well as any fines or penalties that may be imposed upon us in the event of any non-compliance with such laws or regulations) could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. Environmental laws, ordinances and regulations affecting us can be subject to change and such change could result in increased compliance costs, the need for additional capital expenditures, or otherwise adversely affect us. In addition, our power plants are required to comply with numerous domestic and foreign, federal, regional, state and local statutory and regulatory environmental standards and to maintain numerous environmental permits and governmental approvals required for construction and/or operation. We may not be able to renew, maintain or obtain all environmental permits and governmental approvals required for the continued operation or further development of the power plants. We have not yet obtained certain permits and government approvals required for the completion and successful operation of power plants under construction or enhancement. Our failure to renew, maintain or obtain required permits or governmental approvals, including the permits and approvals necessary for operating power plants under construction or enhancement, could cause our operations to be limited or suspended. Finally, some of the environmental permits and governmental approvals that have been issued to the power plants contain conditions and restrictions, including restrictions or limits on emissions and discharges of pollutants and contaminants, or may have limited terms. If we fail to satisfy these conditions or comply with these restrictions, or with any statutory or regulatory environmental standards, we may become subject to regulatory enforcement action and the operation of the power plants could be adversely affected or be subject to fines, penalties or additional costs.. We could be exposed to significant liability for violations of hazardous substances laws because of the use or presence of such substances at our power plants.. Our power plants are subject to numerous domestic and foreign federal, regional, state and local statutory and regulatory standards relating to the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances. We use butane, pentane, industrial lubricants, and other substances at our power plants which are or could become classified as hazardous substances. If any hazardous substances are found to have been released into the environment at or by the power plants in concentrations that exceed regulatory limits, we could become liable for the investigation and removal of those substances, regardless of their source and time of release. If we fail to comply with these laws, ordinances or regulations (or any change thereto), we could be subject to civil or criminal liability, the imposition of liens or fines, and large expenditures to bring the power plants into compliance. Furthermore, in the U.S., we can be held liable for the cleanup of releases of hazardous substances at other locations where we arranged for disposal of those substances, even if we did not cause the release at that location. The cost of any remediation activities in connection with a spill or other release of such substances could be significant.. We believe that at one time there may have been a gas station located on the Mammoth complex site, but because of significant surface disturbance and construction since that time, further physical evaluation of the environmental condition of the former gas station site has been impractical. There may be soil or groundwater contamination and related potential liabilities of which we are unaware related to this site, which may be significant and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. 85. Table of Contents. We may decide not to implement, or may not be successful in implementing, one or more elements of our multi-year strategic plan, and the plan as implemented may not achieve its goal to enhance shareholder value through long-term growth of the Company. We adopted a multi-year strategic plan to:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpand our geographical base;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpand into new technologies, such as energy storage and solar PV electric power generation both in large “utility scale” projects and smaller C&I projects for commercial, industrial, governmental, educational and other institutional customers; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpand our customer base.. There are uncertainties and risks associated with the plan, both as to implementation and outcome. Implementation of the plan may be affected by a number of factors, including that:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe are still developing some elements of the plan and evaluating how and when some elements of the plan will be implemented;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may decide to change, or not implement, one or more elements of the plan over time; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may not be successful in implementing one or more elements of the plan, in each case for a number of reasons.. For example, we may face significant challenges and risks expanding into new technologies (or expanding our geographical or customer base for those new technologies), including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to compete with the large number of other companies pursuing similar business opportunities in energy storage and solar PV power generation, many of which already have established businesses in these areas and/or have greater financial, strategic, technological or other resources than we have;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable, or at all, which we may need, for example, to obtain any technology, personnel, intellectual property, or to acquire one or more existing businesses as a platform for our expansion, or to fund internal research and development, for energy storage and solar PV electric power generation products and services;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to provide energy storage or solar electric power generation products or services that keep pace with rapidly changing technology, customer preferences, equipment costs, market conditions and other factors that will impact these markets;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to devote the amount of management time and other resources required to implement this plan, consistent with continuing to grow our core geothermal and recovered energy businesses; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to recruit appropriate employees.. Expanding our geothermal and recovered energy businesses to new customers and geographical areas will have many of the same risks and uncertainties as those outlined above. These or other factors could mean that we decide to change or even abandon, or are otherwise unable to implement, one or more elements of the plan.. Implementing the plan may involve various costs, including, among other things:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\topportunity costs associated with foregone alternative uses of our resources;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvarious expense items that will impact our current financial results; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tasset revaluations (for example, businesses or other assets acquired for new energy storage or solar PV power generation products or services may suffer impairment charges, as a result of rapidly changing technology, market conditions or otherwise).. These costs may not be recovered, in whole or in part, if one or more elements of the plan are not successfully implemented. These costs, or the failure to implement successfully one or more elements of the plan, could adversely affect our reputation and the reputation of our subsidiaries and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow and the price at which our common stock is traded.. 86. Table of Contents. Apart from the risks associated with implementing the plan, the plan itself will expose us to other risks and uncertainties once implemented. For example, expanding our customer base may expose us to different credit profile customers than our current customers. As another example, expanding our geographic base will subject us to risks associated with doing business in new foreign countries in which we will have to learn the business and political environment, and expanding into new technologies will expose us to risks associated with those products and services. Some of these risks may be similar to those we now face, as described in other risks factors; others may differ or be unknown to us now. The success of the plan, once implemented, will depend, among other things, on our ability to manage these risks effectively.. The trading price of our common stock could decline if securities, industry analysts or our investors disagree with our strategic plan or the way we implement it, either as a result of the factors outlined above or for other reasons.. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the plan will enhance shareholder value through long-term growth of the Company to the extent currently anticipated by our management or at all.. We may not be able to successfully integrate companies, which we acquired and may acquire in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. Our strategy is to continue to expand in the future, including through acquisitions. Integrating acquisitions is often costly, and we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquired companies with our existing operations without substantial costs, delays or other adverse operational or financial consequences. Integrating our acquired companies involves a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure of the acquired companies to achieve the results we expect;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinability to retain key personnel of the acquired companies;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trisks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe difficulty of establishing and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, including accounting controls and procedures.. If any of our acquired companies suffers customer dissatisfaction or performance problems, this could adversely affect the reputation of our group of companies and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. The power generation industry is characterized by intense competition, and we encounter competition from electric utilities, other power producers, and power marketers that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. The power generation industry is characterized by intense competition from electric utilities, other power producers and power marketers. In recent years, there has been increasing competition in the sale of electricity, in part due to excess capacity in a number of U.S. markets and an emphasis on short-term or “spot” markets, and competition has contributed to a reduction in electricity prices. For the most part, we expect that power purchasers interested in long-term arrangements will engage in “competitive bid” solicitations to satisfy new capacity demands. This competition could adversely affect our ability to obtain PPAs and the price paid for electricity by the relevant power purchasers. There is also increasing competition between electric utilities. This competition has put pressure on electric utilities to lower their costs, including the cost of purchased electricity, and increasing competition in the future will put further pressure on power purchasers to reduce the prices at which they purchase electricity from us.. We face increasing competition from other companies engaged in the solar, energy storage, demand response and energy management sectors.. The solar power market is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving. We compete with many companies that have longer operating histories in this sector, larger customer bases, and greater brand recognition, as well as, in some cases, significantly greater financial and marketing resources than us. In some cases, these competitors are vertically integrated in the solar energy sector, manufacturing Solar PV, silicon wafers, and other related products for the solar industry, which may give them an advantage in developing, constructing, owning and operating solar power projects. Our limited experience in the Solar PV sector may affect our ability to successfully develop, construct, finance, and operate Solar PV power projects.. 87. Table of Contents. While our Viridity business does not currently experience intense competition in the younger, less mature energy storage, demand response and energy management markets, this is expected to change in light of recent rapid growth observed in these markets. We expect that our competitors in the energy storage, demand response and energy management markets will include utilities, independent entities, new start-ups, and third party investors, who may compete more successfully in these markets than our Viridity business. If we are unable, as a result of increased competition, to expand our customer base or increase our market share in these rapidly growing markets, our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected.. The existence of a prolonged force majeure event or a forced outage affecting a power plant or the transmission system of the IID could reduce our net income and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. The operation of our subsidiaries’ geothermal power plants is subject to a variety of risks discussed elsewhere in these risk factors, including events such as fires, explosions, earthquakes, landslides, floods, severe storms, volcanic eruptions, lava flow or other similar events. If a power plant experiences an occurrence resulting in a force majeure event, although our subsidiary that owns that power plant would be excused from its obligations under the relevant PPA, the relevant power purchaser may not be required to make any capacity and/or energy payments with respect to the affected power plant for as long as the force majeure event continues and, pursuant to certain of our PPAs, will have the right to prematurely terminate the PPA. Additionally, to the extent that a forced outage has occurred, the relevant power purchaser may not be required to make any capacity and/or energy payments to the affected power plant, and if as a result the power plant fails to attain certain performance requirements under certain of our PPAs, the power purchaser may have the right to permanently reduce the contract capacity (and correspondingly, the amount of capacity payments due pursuant to such agreements in the future), seek refunds of certain past capacity payments, and/or prematurely terminate the PPA. As a consequence, we may not receive any net revenues from the affected power plant other than the proceeds from any business interruption insurance that applies to the force majeure event or forced outage after the relevant waiting period, and may incur significant liabilities in respect of past amounts required to be refunded.. In addition, if the transmission system of the IID experiences a force majeure event or a forced outage which prevents it from transmitting the electricity from the Heber complex, the Ormesa complex or the North Brawley power plant to the relevant power purchaser, the relevant power purchaser would not be required to make energy payments for such non-delivered electricity and may not be required to make any capacity payments with respect to the affected power plant for as long as such force majeure event or forced outage continues. The impact of such force majeure would depend on the duration thereof, with longer outages resulting in greater loss of revenues. In the event of any such force majeure event, our business, financial condition, future results and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.. Some of our leases will terminate if we do not extract geothermal resources in “commercial quantities”, thus requiring us to enter into new leases or secure rights to alternate geothermal resources, none of which may be available on terms as favorable to us as any such terminated lease, if at all.. Most of our geothermal resource leases are for a fixed primary term, and then continue for so long as geothermal resources are extracted in “commercial quantities” or pursuant to other terms of extension. The land covered by some of our leases is undeveloped and has not yet produced geothermal resources in commercial quantities. Leases that cover land which remains undeveloped and does not produce, or does not continue to produce, geothermal resources in commercial quantities and leases that we allow to expire, will terminate. In the event that a lease is terminated and we determine that we will need that lease once the applicable power plant is operating, we would need to enter into one or more new leases with the owner(s) of the premises that are the subject of the terminated lease(s) in order to develop geothermal resources from, or inject geothermal resources into, such premises or secure rights to alternate geothermal resources or lands suitable for injection. We may not be able to do this or may not be able to do so without incurring increased costs, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. 88. Table of Contents. Our BLM leases may be terminated if we fail to comply with any of the provisions of the Geothermal Steam Act or if we fail to comply with the terms or stipulations of such leases, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. Pursuant to the terms of our BLM leases, we are required to conduct our operations on BLM-leased land in a workmanlike manner and in accordance with all applicable laws and BLM directives and to take all mitigating actions required by the BLM to protect the surface of and the environment surrounding the relevant land. Additionally, certain BLM leases contain additional requirements, some of which relate to the mitigation or avoidance of disturbance of any antiquities, cultural values or threatened or endangered plants or animals. In the event of a default under any BLM lease, or the failure to comply with such requirements, or any non-compliance with any of the provisions of the Geothermal Steam Act or regulations issued thereunder, the BLM may, 30 days after notice of default is provided to our relevant project subsidiary, suspend our operations until the requested action is taken or terminate the lease, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. Some of our leases (or subleases) could terminate if the lessor (or sublessor) under any such lease (or sublease) defaults on any debt secured by the relevant property, thus terminating our rights to access the underlying geothermal resources at that location.. The fee interest in the land which is the subject of some of our leases (or subleases) may currently be or may become subject to encumbrances securing loans from third-party lenders to the lessor (or sublessor). Our rights as lessee (or sublessee) under such leases (or subleases) are or may be subject and subordinate to the rights of any such lender. Accordingly, a default by the lessor (or sublessor) under any such loan could result in a foreclosure on the underlying fee interest in the property and thereby terminate our leasehold interest and result in the shutdown of the power plant located on the relevant property and/or terminate our right of access to the underlying geothermal resources required for our operations.. In addition, a default by a sublessor under its lease with the owner of the property that is the subject of our sublease could result in the termination of such lease and thereby terminate our sublease interest and our right to access the underlying geothermal resources required for our operations.. Current and future urbanizing activities and related residential, commercial, and industrial developments may encroach on or limit geothermal or Solar PV activities in the areas of our power plants, thereby affecting our ability to utilize access, inject and/or transport geothermal resources on or underneath the affected surface areas.. Current and future urbanizing activities and related residential, commercial and industrial development may encroach on or limit geothermal activities in the areas of our power plants or construction and operation of Solar PV facilities, thereby affecting our ability to utilize, access, inject, and/or transport geothermal resources on or underneath the affected surface areas or build Solar PV facilities, which require large areas of relatively flat land. In particular, the Heber power plants rely on an area, which we refer to as the Heber Known Geothermal Resource Area, or Heber KGRA, for the geothermal resource necessary to generate electricity at the Heber power plants. Imperial County has adopted a “specific plan area” that covers the Heber KGRA, which we refer to as the “Heber Specific Plan Area”. The Heber Specific Plan Area allows commercial, residential, industrial and other employment oriented development in a mixed-use orientation, which currently includes geothermal uses. Several of the landowners from whom we hold geothermal leases have expressed an interest in developing their land for residential, commercial, industrial or other surface uses in accordance with the parameters of the Heber Specific Plan Area. Currently, Imperial County’s Heber Specific Plan Area is coordinated with the cities of El Centro and Calexico. There has been ongoing underlying interest since the early 1990s to incorporate the community of Heber. While any incorporation process would likely take several years, if Heber were to be incorporated, the City of Heber could replace Imperial County as the governing land use authority, which, depending on its policies, could have a significant effect on land use and availability of geothermal resources.. Current and future development proposals within Imperial County and the City of Calexico, applications for annexations to the City of Calexico, and plans to expand public infrastructure may affect surface areas within the Heber KGRA, thereby limiting our ability to utilize, access, inject and/or transport the geothermal resource on or underneath the affected surface area that is necessary for the operation of our Heber power plants, which could adversely affect our operations and reduce our revenues.. Current construction works and urban developments in the vicinity of our Steamboat complex of power plants in Nevada may also affect future permitting for geothermal operations relating to those power plants. Such works and developments include plans for the construction of a new casino hotel and other commercial or industrial developments on land in the vicinity of our Steamboat complex.. We depend on key personnel for the success of our business.. In general, our success depends to a significant extent on the performance of our senior management, particularly the continued service of our key employees. Our success also depends on our ability to identify, hire and retain other qualified and experienced key personnel. Although to date we have been successful in identifying, hiring and retaining the services of senior management, we face risks associated with our ability to locate or employ on acceptable terms qualified replacements for our senior management or key employees if their services were no longer available, and with the inherent difficulties and uncertainties of transitioning the Company under the leadership of new management.. 89. Table of Contents. In the demand response industry, there is a relatively small pool of experienced personnel. In the relatively new energy storage market, there is an even smaller pool of experienced personnel. Our plans to grow the Viridity business are dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly specialized demand response and energy storage personnel.. Our inability to successfully identify, hire and retain any key employee could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. Our power plants have generally been financed through a combination of our corporate funds and limited or non-recourse project finance debt and lease financing. If our project subsidiaries default on their obligations under such limited or non-recourse debt or lease financing, we may be required to make certain payments to the relevant debt holders, and if the collateral supporting such leveraged financing structures is foreclosed upon we may lose certain of our power plants.. Our power plants have generally been financed using a combination of our corporate funds and limited or non-recourse project finance debt or lease financing. Limited recourse project finance debt refers to our additional agreement, as part of the financing of a power plant, to provide limited financial support for the power plant subsidiary in the form of limited guarantees, indemnities, capital contributions and agreements to pay certain debt service deficiencies. Non-recourse project finance debt or lease financing refers to financing arrangements that are repaid solely from the power plant’s revenues and are secured by the power plant’s physical assets, major contracts, cash accounts and, in many cases, our ownership interest in the project subsidiary. If our project subsidiaries default on their obligations under the relevant debt documents, creditors of a limited recourse project financing will have direct recourse to us, to the extent of our limited recourse obligations, which may require us to use distributions received by us from other power plants, as well as other sources of cash available to us, in order to satisfy such obligations. In addition, if our project subsidiaries default on their obligations under the relevant debt documents (or a default under such debt documents arises as a result of a cross-default to the debt documents of some of our other power plants) and the creditors foreclose on the relevant collateral, we may lose our ownership interest in the relevant project subsidiary or our project subsidiary owning the power plant would only retain an interest in the physical assets, if any, remaining after all debts and obligations were paid in full.. Changes in costs and technology may significantly impact our business by making our power plants and products less competitive.. A basic premise of our business model is that generating baseload power at geothermal power plants produces electricity at a competitive price. However, traditional coal-fired systems and gas-fired systems may under certain economic conditions produce electricity at lower average prices than our geothermal plants. In addition, there are other technologies that can produce electricity such as hydroelectric systems, fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, energy storage systems and solar PV systems. Some of these alternative technologies currently produce electricity at a higher average price than our geothermal plants while others produce electricity at a lower average price, It is possible that technological advances and economies of scale will further reduce the cost of alternate methods of power generation. It is also possible that energy technologies will compete with our basic premise of a firm (non-intermittent) renewable baseload power source by combining renewable technologies with energy storage to provide an alternative to firm baseload energy. If this were to happen, the competitive advantage of our power plants may be significantly impaired.. Our expectations regarding the market potential for the development of recovered energy-based power generation may not materialize, and as a result we may not derive any significant revenues from this line of business.. Demand for our recovered energy-based power generation units may not materialize or grow at the levels that we expect. We currently face competition in this market from manufacturers of conventional steam turbines and may face competition from other related technologies in the future. If this market does not materialize at the levels that we expect, we will not generate any material revenues.. Our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business.. Our existing intellectual property rights, including those we acquired in connection with the acquisition of our Viridity business, may not be adequate to protect our business. While we occasionally file patent applications, patents may not be issued on the basis of such applications or, if patents are issued, they may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, any patents issued to us or for which we have use rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented.. 90. Table of Contents. In order to safeguard our unpatented proprietary know-how, trade secrets and technology, we rely primarily upon trade secret protection and non-disclosure provisions in agreements with employees and others having access to confidential information. These measures may not adequately protect us from disclosure or misappropriation of our proprietary information.. Even if we adequately protect our intellectual property rights, litigation may be necessary to enforce these rights, which could result in substantial costs to us and a substantial diversion of management attention. Also, while we have attempted to ensure that our technology and the operation of our business do not infringe other parties’ patents and proprietary rights, our competitors or other parties may assert that certain aspects of our business or technology may be covered by patents held by them. Infringement or other intellectual property claims, regardless of merit or ultimate outcome, can be expensive and time-consuming and can divert management’s attention from our core business.. Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, cyber-attacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt our business, or the businesses of third parties, may impact our operations in unpredictable ways and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. We are subject to the potentially adverse operating and financial effects of terrorist acts and threats, as well as cyber-attacks, including, among others, malware, viruses and attachments to e-mails, and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups. Our generation and transmission facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities, systems and physical assets, including our Viridity business’s VPowerTM software platform, could be directly or indirectly affected by such activities. Terrorist acts or other similar events could harm our business by limiting our ability to generate or transmit power and by delaying the development and construction of new generating facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities. These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair and insure our assets, and could adversely affect operations by contributing to the disruption of supplies and markets for geothermal and recovered energy. Such events could also impair our ability to raise capital by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity.. We operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite our implementation of security measures, all of our technology systems (and any programs or data stored thereon or therein) are vulnerable to security breaches, failures, data leakage or unauthorized access due to such activities. Those breaches and events may result from acts of our employees, contractors or third parties. If our technology systems were to fail or be breached and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. The implementation of security guidelines and measures and maintenance of insurance, to the extent available, addressing such activities could increase costs. These types of events could adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow. In addition such events could require significant management attention and resources and could adversely affect our reputation among customers and the public.. A disruption of transmission or the transmission infrastructure facilities of third parties could negatively impact our business. Because generation and transmission systems are part of an interconnected system, we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption caused by the impact of an event on the interconnected system within our systems or within a neighboring system. Any such disruption could adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. Possible fluctuations in the cost of construction, raw materials, commodities and drilling may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results, and cash flow.. Our manufacturing operations are dependent on the supply of various raw materials, including primarily steel and aluminum, commodities and industrial equipment components that we use. We currently obtain all such raw materials, commodities and equipment at prevailing market prices. We are not dependent on any one supplier and do not have any long-term agreements with any of our suppliers. Future cost increases of such raw materials, commodities and equipment, to the extent not otherwise passed along to our customers, could adversely affect our profit margins.. 91. Table of Contents. Conditions in and around Israel, where the majority of our senior management and our main production and manufacturing facilities are located, may adversely affect our operations and may limit our ability to produce and sell our products or manage our power plants.. The majority of our senior management and our main production and manufacturing facilities are located in Israel. As such, political, economic and security conditions in Israel directly affect our operations.. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors, and the continued state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has led to security and economic problems for Israel.. Negotiations between Israel and representatives of the Palestinian Authority in an effort to resolve the state of conflict have been sporadic and have failed to result in peace. The establishment in 2006 of a government in the Gaza territory by representatives of the Hamas militant group has created additional unrest and uncertainty in the region. In each of December 2008, November 2012 and July 2014, Israel engaged in an armed conflict with Hamas, each of which involved additional missile strikes from the Gaza Strip into Israel and disrupted most day-to-day civilian activity in the proximity of the border with the Gaza Strip. Our production facilities in Israel are located approximately 26 miles from the border with the Gaza Strip.. The political instability and civil unrest in the Middle East and North Africa (including the ongoing civil war in Syria) as well as the increased tension between Iran and Israel have raised new concerns regarding security in the region and the potential for armed conflict or other hostilities involving Israel. We could be adversely affected by any such hostilities, the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners, or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel. In addition, the sale of products manufactured in Israel may be adversely affected in certain countries by restrictive laws, policies or practices directed toward Israel or companies having operations in Israel.. In addition, some of our employees in Israel are subject to being called upon to perform military service in Israel, and their absence may have an adverse effect upon our operations. Generally, unless exempt, male adult citizens of Israel under the age of 41 are obligated to perform up to 36 days of military reserve duty annually. Additionally, all such citizens are subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances.. These events and conditions could disrupt our operations in Israel, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results, and cash flow.. We are a holding company and our revenues depend substantially on the performance of our subsidiaries and the power plants they operate, most of which are subject to restrictions and taxation on dividends and distributions.. We are a holding company whose primary assets are our ownership of the equity interests in our subsidiaries. We conduct no other business and, as a result, we depend entirely upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and cash flow.. The agreements pursuant to which most of our subsidiaries have incurred debt restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends, make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us prior to the satisfaction of other obligations, including the payment of operating expenses, debt service and replenishment or maintenance of cash reserves. In the case of some of our power plants that are owned jointly with other partners, there may be certain additional restrictions on dividend distributions pursuant to our agreements with those partners. In all of the foreign countries where our existing power plants are located, dividend payments to us are also subject to withholding taxes. Each of the events described above may reduce or eliminate the aggregate amount of revenues we can receive from our subsidiaries.. We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which, if not timely remediated, may adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements, and our reputation, business and the price of our common stock, as well as lead to a loss of investor confidence in us.. In connection with the change in our repatriation strategy and the related release of the US income tax valuation allowance in the second quarter of 2017, we did not perform an effective risk assessment related to our internal controls over the accounting for income taxes.  As a result, we identified a deficiency in the design of our internal control over financial reporting related to our accounting for income taxes, which affected the recording of income tax accounts by us in our interim and annual consolidated financial statements during 2017, including audit adjustments to the income tax accounts. As described under “Item 9A. Controls and Procedures” below, our management has concluded that this deficiency constitutes a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and, accordingly, internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2017.. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.. While we have developed and are in the process of implementing a remediation plan to remediate this material weakness and believe, based on our most recent assessment, that this material weakness will be remediated during 2018, there can be no assurance that this will occur within the expected timeline.  We may identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future.  If we are unable to remediate this material weakness or we identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to analyze, record and report financial information accurately, to prepare our financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the SEC and to otherwise comply with our reporting obligations under the federal securities laws, will likely be adversely affected.  The occurrence of, or failure to remediate, this material weakness and any future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements, and our reputation, business and the price of our Common Stock or any other securities we may issue, as well as lead to a loss of investor confidence in us.. U.S. federal income tax reform could adversely affect us.. On December 22, 2017, U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law, significantly reforming the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The Tax Act, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates (including reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%), imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, puts into effect the migration from a “worldwide” system of taxation to a territorial system and modifies or repeals many business deductions and credits.. The Tax Act is likely to make some borrowing more expensive.  It denies interest deductions on debt starting in 2018 to the extent a company's net interest expense exceeds 30 percent of its adjusted taxable income.  Its income for this purpose means income ignoring interest expense, interest income, net operating losses and -- only through 2021 -- depreciation, amortization and depletion.  Thus, the 30-percent limit is more likely to come into play after 2021 when depreciation, amortization and depletion are no longer added back to the 30-percent base. Any interest that cannot be deducted in a year can be carried forward indefinitely.. 92. Table of Contents. The Tax Act subjects U.S. corporations with offshore subsidiaries to a one-time U.S. tax on untaxed earnings in offshore holding companies as if the earnings had been brought back to the U.S. thereby triggering a tax.  All post-1986 net \"earnings and profits\" in offshore holding companies will be taxed at a 15.5 percent rate to the extent they are being held in cash or cash equivalents and at an eight percent rate otherwise.  Companies must calculate the earnings as of November 2, 2017 and December 31, 2017 and pay U.S. tax on whichever amount is higher. The tax can be paid ratably over eight years.  Eight percent of the tax would have to be paid in each of the first five years starting in 2017, increasing to 15 percent in year six, 20 percent in year seven and 25 percent in year eight.. Corporations will no longer be able to use net operating losses incurred after 2017 to reduce income by more than 80 percent in a year, and corporations will no longer be able to carry such losses back two years as they have been allowed to do in the past.. Starting in 2018, the U.S. will no longer allow some cross-border interest and royalty payments to related companies to be deducted. This would happen if the other country treats the payments as something other than interest or royalties for its tax purposes or the two countries treat the U.S. company making the payments differently: for example, one treats it as a corporation and the other treats it as fiscally transparent or vice versa. Once the provision is triggered, deductions would be denied in the U.S. to the extent the payment does not have to be reported as income in the foreign country.. We continue to examine the impact the Tax Act may have on our business. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the Tax Act is uncertain, and our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow, as well as our stock price, could be adversely affected.. Possible application of the new base erosion anti-avoidance tax in the U.S. may adversely affect us.. The recently enacted Tax Act in the U.S. included a base erosion and anti-abuse tax, or BEAT, that could apply to us and, more importantly, could reduce the amount of tax equity that can be raised on geothermal projects on which PTCs will be claimed.  The aim of the base erosion tax is to prevent multinational companies from reducing their U.S. taxes by “stripping” earnings across the U.S. border by making payments to foreign affiliates that can be deducted in the U.S. An example of such a payment is interest on an intercompany loan or a payment to a back office in a foreign country for equipment or services. The goal of the base erosion tax is to ensure that multinational companies do not use cross-border payments to reduce their U.S. taxes to less than 10 percent of an expanded definition of taxable income. The base erosion tax requires an annual calculation.  The tax only applies to companies with at least $500 million in average annual gross receipts in the three prior years before the calculation.  If the tax applies to us, our tax equity raised on geothermal projects on which PTCs can be claimed may be reduced, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. The Israeli Tax Ruling we obtained in connection with our acquisition of Ormat Industries imposes conditions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business and our ability to enter into certain corporate transactions.. The Israel Tax Ruling we obtained in connection with the acquisition of Ormat Industries imposes a number of conditions that limit our flexibility in operating our business and in engaging in certain corporate transactions. Until the end of 2018, we agreed to maintain (and, to the extent that our operations expand, likewise expand) the production activities we currently carry out in Israel. Under certain circumstances, these conditions may not allow us the flexibility that we need to operate our business and may prevent us from taking advantage of strategic opportunities that would benefit our business and our stockholders.. A substantial percentage of our common stock is held by stockholders whose interests may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.. On July 26, 2017, ORIX Corporation (“ORIX”) purchased approximately 22% of our shares of common stock outstanding. Pursuant to the Governance Agreement between the Company and ORIX entered into in connection with this stock purchase transaction, ORIX has the right to designate three directors to our Board for as long as ORIX and its affiliates collectively hold at least 18% of the voting power of all of the outstanding voting securities of the Company as well as the right to representation on certain committees of our Board. ORIX may also exercise certain registration rights pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement between the Company and ORIX.. As a result of these rights and ORIX’s beneficial ownership of our common stock, ORIX could exert influence through its Board representation on the business, operations and management of the Company and its subsidiaries, including our strategic plans, or, as a significant stockholder, on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership of our common stock could delay or prevent proxy contests, mergers, tender offers, or other purchases of our common stock that might otherwise give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for our shares. If ORIX exercises its registration rights to require the Company to register for sale the common stock held by ORIX or ORIX otherwise sells its common stock in the public markets, the price of our common stock may decline. This concentration of ownership may also adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock.. The price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially, and your investment may decline in value.. The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to many factors, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations including as a result of seasonal variations in our Electricity segment-based revenues or variations from year-to-year in our Product segment-based revenues;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvariance in our financial performance from the expectations of market analysts;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconditions and trends in the end markets we serve, and changes in the estimation of the size and growth rate of these markets;. <U+25CF> \t\t\tour ability to integrate acquisitions;. <U+25CF> \t\t\tannouncements of significant contracts by us or our competitors;. <U+25CF> \t\t\tchanges in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;. <U+25CF> \t\t\trestatements of historical financial results and changes in financial forecasts;. <U+25CF> \t\t\tloss of one or more of our significant customers;. <U+25CF> \t\t\tlegislation;. 93.

In addition, the stock market in general, and the NYSE and the market for energy companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies affected. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against that company. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.. Regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and may damage our relationship with certain customers.. On August 22, 2012, the SEC adopted requirements regarding mandatory disclosure for companies regarding their use of \"conflict minerals\" (including tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold) in their products. In general, while we do not directly purchase or use any of these “conflict minerals” as raw materials in the products we manufacture or as part of our manufacturing processes, we will need to examine whether such minerals are contained in the products supplied to us by third parties and, if so, whether such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. If we utilize any of these minerals and they are necessary to the production or functionality of any of our products or products we are contracted to manufacture, we will need to conduct specified due diligence activities and file with the SEC a report disclosing, among other things, whether such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. The implementation of these SEC rules could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of certain components incorporated in our products. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products, and possibly additional expenses related to any changes to our products we may decide are advisable based upon our due diligence findings. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free.. 94.
