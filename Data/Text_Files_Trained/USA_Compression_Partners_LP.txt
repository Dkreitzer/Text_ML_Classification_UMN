[1] "ITEM 1A.Risk Factors. As described in Part I (\"Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\"), this report contains forward-looking statements regarding us, our business and our industry. The risk factors described below, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, we might not be able to continue to pay our current quarterly distribution on our common units or grow such distributions and the trading price of our common units could decline.. Risks Related to Our Business. We may not have sufficient cash from operations following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including cost reimbursements to our general partner, to enable us to make cash distributions at our current distribution rate to our unitholders.. In order to make cash distributions at our current distribution rate of $0.525 per unit per quarter, or $2.10 per unit per year, we will require available cash of $33.1 million per quarter, or $132.2 million per year, based on the number of common units and the 1.2% general partner interest outstanding as of February 8, 2018. Under our cash distribution policy, the amount of cash we can distribute to our unitholders principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of production of, demand for, and price of natural gas and crude oil, particularly the level of production in the locations where we provide compression services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe fees we charge, and the margins we realize, from our compression services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of achieving organic growth in current and new markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability to effectively integrate any assets or businesses we acquire, including the CDM Acquisition;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of competition from other companies; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprevailing global and regional economic and regulatory conditions, and their impact on us and our customers.. In addition, the actual amount of cash we will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe levels of our maintenance capital expenditures and expansion capital expenditures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of our operating costs and expenses;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour debt service requirements and other liabilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in our working capital needs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions contained in our revolving credit facility;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in interest rates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe financial condition of our customers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to borrow funds and access the capital markets; and. 15. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe amount of cash reserves established by our general partner.. A long-term reduction in the demand for, or production of, natural gas or crude oil could adversely affect the demand for our services or the prices we charge for our services, which could result in a decrease in our revenues and cash available for distribution to unitholders.. The demand for our compression services depends upon the continued demand for, and production of, natural gas and crude oil. Demand may be affected by, among other factors, natural gas prices, crude oil prices, weather, availability of alternative energy sources, governmental regulation and general demand for energy. Any prolonged, substantial reduction in the demand for natural gas or crude oil would likely depress the level of production activity and result in a decline in the demand for our compression services, which could result in a reduction in our revenues and our cash available for distribution.. In particular, lower natural gas or crude oil prices over the long term could result in a decline in the production of natural gas or crude oil, respectively, resulting in reduced demand for our compression services. For example, the North American rig count, as measured by Baker Hughes, hit a 2014 peak of 1,931 rigs on September 12, 2014, and at that time, Henry Hub natural gas spot prices were $3.82 per MMBtu and West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") crude oil spot prices were $92.18 per barrel. By contrast, the North American rig count hit a modern low of 404 rigs on May 20, 2016, and at that time, Henry Hub natural gas spot prices were $1.92 per MMBtu and WTI crude oil spot prices were $47.67 per barrel. This slowdown in new drilling activity caused some pressure on service rates for new and existing services and contributed to a decline in our utilization during 2015 and into 2016. By the end of December 2017, the North American rig count was 929 rigs, as WTI crude oil spot prices hovered near their highest level since the summer of 2015 at $60.46 per barrel and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices were $2.81 per MMBtu. Although commodity prices and our utilization increased during 2016 and 2017, the increased activity resulting from such increased commodity prices may not continue or the trend of increasing commodity prices may reverse. In addition, a small portion of our fleet is used in connection with crude oil production using horizontal drilling techniques. During the period of low crude oil prices, we experienced pressure on service rates from our customers in gas lift applications; if commodity prices decline from current levels, we may experience pressure on service rates.. Additionally, an increasing percentage of natural gas and crude oil production comes from unconventional sources, such as shales, tight sands and coalbeds. Such sources can be less economically feasible to produce in low commodity price environments, in part due to costs related to compression requirements, and a reduction in demand for natural gas or gas lift for crude oil may cause such sources of natural gas or crude oil to be uneconomic to drill and produce, which could in turn negatively impact the demand for our services. Further, if demand for our services decreases, we may be asked to renegotiate our service contracts at lower rates. In addition, governmental regulation and tax policy may impact the demand for natural gas or crude oil or impact the economic feasibility of development of new fields or production of existing fields, which are important components of our ability to expand.. We have several key customers. The loss of any of these customers would result in a decrease in our revenues and cash available for distribution.. We provide compression services under contracts with several key customers. The loss of one of these key customers may have a greater effect on our financial results than for a company with a more diverse customer base. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 43% of our revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The loss of all or even a portion of the compression services we provide to our key customers, as a result of competition or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash available for distribution.. The deterioration of the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our business.. During times when the natural gas or crude oil markets weaken, our customers are more likely to experience financial difficulties, including being unable to access debt or equity financing, which could result in a reduction in our customers' spending for our services. For example, our customers could seek to preserve capital by using lower cost. 16. Table of Contents. providers, not renewing month-to-month contracts or determining not to enter into any new compression service contracts. A significant decline in commodity prices may cause certain of our customers to reconsider near-term capital budgets, which may impact large-scale natural gas infrastructure and crude oil production activities. Reduced demand for our services could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, in the course of our business we hold accounts receivable from our customers. In the event that any such customer was to enter into bankruptcy, we could lose all or a portion of such outstanding accounts receivable associated with that customer. Further, if a customer was to enter into bankruptcy, it could also result in the cancellation of all or a portion of our service contracts with such customer at significant expense to us.. We face significant competition that may cause us to lose market share and reduce our cash available for distribution.. The compression business is highly competitive. Some of our competitors have a broader geographic scope, as well as greater financial and other resources than we do. Our ability to renew or replace existing contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenue and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors and our customers. If our competitors substantially increase the resources they devote to the development and marketing of competitive services or substantially decrease the prices at which they offer their services, we may be unable to compete effectively. Some of these competitors may expand or construct newer, more powerful or more flexible compression fleets that would create additional competition for us. All of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and reduce our cash available for distribution.. Our customers may choose to vertically integrate their operations by purchasing and operating their own compression fleet, expanding the amount of compression units they currently own or using alternative technologies for enhancing crude oil production.. Our customers that are significant producers, processors, gatherers and transporters of natural gas and crude oil may choose to vertically integrate their operations by purchasing and operating their own compression fleets in lieu of using our compression services. The historical availability of attractive financing terms from financial institutions and equipment manufacturers facilitates this possibility by making the purchase of individual compression units increasingly affordable to our customers. In addition, there are many technologies available for the artificial enhancement of crude oil production, and our customers may elect to use these alternative technologies instead of the gas lift compression services we provide. Such vertical integration, increases in vertical integration or use of alternative technologies could result in decreased demand for our compression services, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and reduce our cash available for distribution.. A significant portion of our services are provided to customers on a month-to-month basis, and we cannot be sure that such customers will continue to utilize our services.. Our contracts typically have an initial term of between six months and five years, depending on the application and location of the compression unit. After the expiration of the applicable term, the contract continues on a month-to-month or longer basis until terminated by us or our customers upon notice as provided for in the applicable contract. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 51% of our compression services on a revenue basis were provided on a month-to-month basis to customers who continue to utilize our services following expiration of the primary term of their contracts with us. These customers can generally terminate their month-to-month compression services contracts on 30-days' written notice. If a significant number of these customers were to terminate their month-to-month services, or attempt to renegotiate their month-to-month contracts at substantially lower rates, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash available for distribution.. 17. Table of Contents. We may be unable to grow our cash flows if we are unable to expand our business, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase distributions to our unitholders.. A principal focus of our strategy is to continue to grow the per unit distribution on our units by expanding our business over time. Our future growth will depend upon a number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These factors include our ability to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelop new business and enter into service contracts with new customers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tretain our existing customers and maintain or expand the services we provide them;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmaintain or increase the fees we charge, and the margins we realize, from our compression services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trecruit and train qualified personnel and retain valued employees;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpand our geographic presence;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teffectively manage our costs and expenses, including costs and expenses related to growth;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconsummate accretive acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtain required debt or equity financing on favorable terms for our existing and new operations; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmeet customer specific contract requirements or pre-qualifications.. If we do not achieve our expected growth, we may not be able to maintain or increase distributions to our unitholders, in which event the market price of our units will likely decline materially.. We may be unable to grow successfully through acquisitions, and we may not be able to integrate effectively the businesses we may acquire, which may impact our operations and limit our ability to increase distributions to our unitholders.. From time to time, we may choose to make business acquisitions, such as the CDM Acquisition, to pursue market opportunities, increase our existing capabilities and expand into new areas of operations. While we have reviewed acquisition opportunities in the past and will continue to do so in the future, we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities or successfully acquire identified targets. In addition, we may not be successful in integrating any future acquisitions, including the CDM Acquisition, into our existing operations, which may result in unforeseen operational difficulties or diminished financial performance or require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention. Even if we are successful in integrating future acquisitions into our existing operations, we may not derive the benefits, such as operational or administrative synergies, that we expected from such acquisitions, which may result in the commitment of our capital resources without the expected returns on such capital. Furthermore, competition for acquisition opportunities may escalate, increasing our cost of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making acquisitions. Our inability to make acquisitions, or to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing operations, may adversely impact our operations and limit our ability to increase distributions to our unitholders.. Our ability to grow in the future is dependent on our ability to access external expansion capital.. Our partnership agreement requires us to distribute to our unitholders all of our available cash, which excludes prudent operating reserves. We expect that we will rely primarily upon cash generated by operating activities and, where necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund expansion capital expenditures. However, we may not be able to obtain equity or debt financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. To the extent we are unable to efficiently finance growth externally, our ability to increase distributions to our unitholders could be significantly impaired. In addition, because we distribute all of our available cash, which excludes prudent operating reserves, we may not grow as quickly as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations. To the extent we issue additional units including the Preferred Units described in Item 1 (\"Business - Recent Developments\"), the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level. There are no limitations in our partnership agreement on our ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units, subject to certain. 18. Table of Contents. restrictions in our partnership agreement that will take effect when the Preferred Units are issued. Similarly, the incurrence of borrowings or other debt by us to finance our growth strategy would result in interest expense, which in turn would affect our cash available for distribution.. Our debt levels may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing, pursuing other business opportunities and paying distributions.. We have a $1.1 billion revolving credit facility that matures in January 2020. In addition, we have the option to increase the amount of total commitments under the revolving credit facility by $200 million, subject to receipt of lender commitments and satisfaction of other conditions. As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding borrowings of $782.9 million with a leverage ratio of 4.65x, borrowing base availability (based on our borrowing base) of $272.1 million and, subject to compliance with the applicable financial covenants, available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility of $101.6 million. Financial covenants permit a maximum leverage ratio of (A) 5.25 to 1.0 as of the end of the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2017 and (B) 5.00 to 1.0 thereafter. As of February 8, 2018, we had outstanding borrowings of $815.0 million.. Our ability to incur additional debt is subject to limitations in our revolving credit facility, including certain financial covenants. Our level of debt could have important consequences to us, including the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may not be available or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe will need a portion of our cash flow to make payments on our indebtedness, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operating activities, future business opportunities and distributions; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour debt level will make us more vulnerable, than our competitors with less debt, to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally.. Our ability to service our debt will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to service our debt under the revolving credit facility could be impacted by market interest rates, as all of our outstanding borrowings are subject to interest rates that fluctuate with movements in interest rate markets. A substantial increase in the interest rates applicable to our outstanding borrowings could have a material impact on our cash available for distribution. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we could be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital. We may be unable to effect any of these actions on terms satisfactory to us, or at all.. Restrictions in our revolving credit facility may limit our ability to make distributions to our unitholders and may limit our ability to capitalize on acquisition and other business opportunities.. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our revolving credit facility and any future financing agreements could restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue our business activities. Our revolving credit facility restricts or limits our ability (subject to exceptions) to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgrant liens;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake certain loans or investments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur additional indebtedness or guarantee other indebtedness;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into transactions with affiliates;. 19. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmerge or consolidate;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsell our assets; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake certain acquisitions.. Furthermore, our revolving credit facility contains certain operating and financial covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If we violate any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or other tests in our revolving credit facility, a significant portion of our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable, our lenders' commitment to make further loans to us may terminate, and we may be prohibited from making distributions to our unitholders. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. We may not be able to replace such revolving credit facility, or if we are, any subsequent replacement of our revolving credit facility or any new indebtedness could have similar or greater restrictions. Please read Part II, Item 7 (\"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Description of Revolving Credit Facility\").. Restrictions in our partnership agreement related to the Preferred Units may limit our ability to make distributions to our unitholders and may limit our ability to capitalize on acquisition and other business opportunities.. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our partnership agreement related to the Preferred Units could restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue our business activities. If the Preferred Units are issued, our partnership agreement will restrict or limit our ability (subject to exceptions) to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpay distributions on any junior securities, including the common units, prior to paying the quarterly distribution payable to the holders of the Preferred Units, including any previously accrued and unpaid distributions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tissue any securities that rank senior to or pari passu with the Preferred Units; however, we will be able to issue an unlimited number of securities ranking junior to the Preferred Units, including junior preferred units and common units; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur Indebtedness (as defined in our revolving credit facility) if, after giving pro forma effect to such incurrence, the Leverage Ratio (as defined in our revolving credit facility) determined as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter would exceed 6.5x, subject to certain exceptions.. An impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets could reduce our earnings.. We have recorded $35.9 million of goodwill and $71.7 million of other intangible assets as of December 31, 2017. Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets. Generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (\"GAAP\") requires us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. Any event that causes a reduction in demand for our services could result in a reduction of our estimates of future cash flows and growth rates in our business. These events could cause us to record impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets. If we determine that any of our goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired, we will be required to take an immediate charge to earnings with a corresponding reduction of partners' capital resulting in an increase in balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization. There was no impairment recorded for goodwill or other intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a $172.2 million impairment of goodwill due primarily to the decline in our unit price, the sustained decline in global commodity prices, expected reduction in the capital budgets of certain of our customers and the impact these factors have on our expected future cash flows (see Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements). There was no impairment recorded for other intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2015.. 20. Table of Contents. Impairment in the carrying value of long-lived assets could reduce our earnings.. We have a significant amount of long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Under GAAP, long-lived assets are required to be reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable or will no longer be utilized in the operating fleet. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If business conditions or other factors cause the expected undiscounted cash flows to decline, we may be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Events and conditions that could result in impairment in the value of our long-lived assets include changes in the industry in which we operate, competition, advances in technology, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, or other factors leading to reduction in expected long-term profitability. For example, during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we evaluated the future deployment of our idle fleet under then-current market conditions and determined to retire and either sell or re-utilize the key components of 40 and 29 compressor units, or approximately 11,000 and 15,000 horsepower, that were previously used to provide services in our business. As a result, we recognized impairments of $5.0 million and $5.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.. Our ability to manage and grow our business effectively may be adversely affected if we lose management or operational personnel.. We depend on the continuing efforts of our executive officers. The departure of any of our executive officers could have a significant negative effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace.. Additionally, our ability to hire, train and retain qualified personnel will continue to be important and could become more challenging as we grow and to the extent energy industry market conditions are competitive. When general industry conditions are good, the competition for experienced operational and field technicians increases as other energy and manufacturing companies' needs for the same personnel increases. Our ability to grow or even to continue our current level of service to our current customers could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully hire, train and retain these important personnel.. We depend on a limited number of suppliers and are vulnerable to product shortages and price increases, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.. The substantial majority of the components for our natural gas compression equipment are supplied by Caterpillar Inc., Cummins Inc. and Arrow Engine Company for engines, Air-X-Changers and Alfa Laval (US) for coolers, and Ariel Corporation, GE Oil & Gas Gemini products and Arrow Engine Company for compressor frames and cylinders.  Our reliance on these suppliers involves several risks, including price increases and a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components in a timely manner. We also rely primarily on four vendors, A G Equipment Company, Alegacy Equipment, LLC, Standard Equipment Corp. and S&R, to package and assemble our compression units. We do not have long-term contracts with these suppliers or packagers, and a partial or complete loss of any of these sources could have a negative impact on our results of operations and could damage our customer relationships. Some of these suppliers manufacture the components we purchase in a single facility and any damage to that facility could lead to significant delays in delivery of completed units.. We are subject to substantial environmental regulation, and changes in these regulations could increase our costs or liabilities.. We are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations, including laws and regulations regarding the discharge of materials into the environment, emission controls and other environmental protection and occupational health and safety concerns, as discussed in detail in Item 1 (\"Business Environmental and Safety Regulations\"). Environmental laws and regulations may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, which may render us liable for remediation costs, natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior owners or operators or other third parties. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for neighboring land owners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of. 21. Table of Contents. response costs. Remediation costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations, and costs associated with new information, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations.. We conduct operations in a wide variety of locations across the continental U.S. These operations require U.S. federal, state or local environmental permits or other authorizations. Our operations may require new or amended facility permits or licenses from time to time with respect to storm water discharges, waste handling or air emissions relating to equipment operations, which subject us to new or revised permitting conditions that may be onerous or costly to comply with. Additionally, the operation of compression units may require individual air permits or general authorizations to operate under various air regulatory programs established by rule or regulation. These permits and authorizations frequently contain numerous compliance requirements, including monitoring and reporting obligations and operational restrictions, such as emission limits. Given the wide variety of locations in which we operate, and the numerous environmental permits and other authorizations that are applicable to our operations, we may occasionally identify or be notified of technical violations of certain requirements existing in various permits or other authorizations. We could be subject to penalties for any noncompliance in the future.. In our business, we routinely deal with natural gas, oil and other petroleum products at our worksites. Hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances or wastes may have been disposed or released on, under or from properties used by us to provide compression services or inactive compression unit storage or on or under other locations where such substances or wastes have been taken for disposal. These properties may be subject to investigatory, remediation and monitoring requirements under federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.. The modification or interpretation of existing environmental laws or regulations, the more vigorous enforcement of existing environmental laws or regulations, or the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations may also negatively impact oil and natural gas exploration and production, gathering and pipeline companies, including our customers, which in turn could have a negative impact on us.. New regulations, proposed regulations and proposed modifications to existing regulations under the Clean Air Act, if implemented, could result in increased compliance costs.. New regulations or proposed modifications to existing regulations under the Clean Air Act, as discussed in detail in Item 1 (\"Business Environmental and Safety Regulations\"), may lead to adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash available for distribution. For example, in 2015, the EPA finalized a rule strengthening the primary and secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standards (\"NAAQS\") for ground level ozone, both of which are 8-hour concentration standards of 70 parts per billion (\"ppb\"). After the EPA revises a NAAQS standard, the states are expected to establish revised attainment/non-attainment regions. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our customers' ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, which could impact our customers' operations, increase the cost of additions to property, plant, and equipment, and negatively impact our business.. In 2012, the EPA finalized rules that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. Specifically, the EPA's rule package included New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds (\"VOCs\") and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. The rules established specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors and controllers at natural gas processing plants, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment as well as the first federal air standards for natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured. In June 2016, the EPA took steps to expand on these regulations when it published New Source Performance Standards, known as Subpart OOOOa, that require certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce these methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions. These Subpart OOOOa standards will expand the 2012 New Source Performance Standards by using certain equipment-specific emissions control practices, requiring additional controls for pneumatic controllers and pumps as well as compressors, and imposing leak detection and repair requirements for natural gas compressor and booster. 22. Table of Contents. stations. However, the EPA announced in April 2017 that it intends to reconsider certain aspects of the 2016 New Source Performance Standards, and in May 2017, the EPA issued an administrative stay of key provisions of the rule, but was promptly ordered by the D.C. Circuit to implement the rule. The EPA also proposed 60-day and two-year stays of certain provisions in June 2017 and published a Notice of Data Availability in November 2017 seeking comment and providing clarification regarding the agency's legal authority to stay the rule.. If implemented, Subpart OOOOa and any additional regulation of air emissions from the oil and gas sector could result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, which could impact our customers' operations and negatively impact our business.. Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased compliance costs.. Climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of natural gas, are examples of greenhouse gases. In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. It presently appears unlikely that comprehensive climate legislation will be passed by either house of Congress in the near future, although energy legislation and other initiatives are expected to be proposed that may be relevant to greenhouse gas emissions issues. However, almost half of the states have begun to address greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Depending on the particular program, we could be required to control greenhouse gas emissions or to purchase and surrender allowances for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our operations.. Independent of Congress, and as discussed in detail in Item 1 (\"Business Environmental and Safety Regulations\"), the EPA undertook to adopt regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions under its existing CAA authority. For example, in 2015, the EPA published standards of performance for greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants. The final rule establishes a performance standard for integrated gasification combined cycled units and utility boilers based on the use of the best system of emission reduction that EPA has determined has been adequately demonstrated for each type of unit. The rule also sets limits for stationary natural gas combustion turbines based on the use of natural gas combined cycle technology. The EPA also promulgated the Clean Power Plan rule, which is intended to reduce carbon emissions from existing power plants by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the implementation of the Clean Power Plan, which will remain in effect throughout the pendency of the appeals process including at the United States Court of Appeals of the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court through any certiorari petition that may be granted. The stay suspends the rule, including the requirement that states must start submitting implementation plans. Additionally, in October 2017 EPA proposed to repeal the CPP, although the final outcome of this action and the pending litigation regarding the CPP is uncertain at this time. In connection with the proposed repeal, EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\"ANPRM\") in December 2017 regarding emission guidelines to limit GHG emissions from existing electricity utility generating units. The ANPRM seeks comment regarding what the EPA should include in a potential new, existing-source regulation under the Clean Air Act of GHG emissions from electric utility generating units that it may propose. If the effort to repeal the rules is unsuccessful and the rules are upheld at the conclusion of this appellate process and enforced in their current form, or if the ANPRM results in a different proposal to control GHG emissions from electric utility generating units, demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce may decrease.. Although it is not currently possible to predict with specificity how any proposed or future greenhouse gas legislation, regulation, agreements or initiatives will impact our business, any legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions or reduced demand for our services, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHG in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If any of those effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.. 23. Table of Contents. Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in natural gas production by our customers, which could adversely impact our revenue.. A significant portion of our customers' natural gas production is developed from unconventional sources that require hydraulic fracturing as part of the completion process. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to stimulate gas production. Legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act (\"SDWA\") to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of \"underground injection\" and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, have been proposed and the U.S. Congress continues to consider legislation to amend the SDWA. Scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways, with the EPA having commenced a multi-year study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing. In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that \"water cycle\" activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources \"under some circumstances,\" noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits.. State and federal regulatory agencies have also recently focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity. Similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. Developing research suggests that the link between seismic activity and wastewater disposal may vary by region, and that only a very small fraction of the tens of thousands of injection wells have been suspected to be, or have been, the likely cause of induced seismicity. In March 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arkansas. In light of these concerns, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal, which could indirectly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, these concerns may give rise to private tort suits against our customers from individuals who claim they are adversely impacted by seismic activity they allege was induced. Such claims or actions could result in liability to our customers for property damage, exposure to waste and other hazardous materials, nuisance or personal injuries, and require our customers to expend additional resources or incur substantial costs or losses. This could in turn adversely affect the demand for our services.. We cannot predict the future of any such legislation or tort liability. If additional levels of regulation, restrictions and permits were required through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal or state level or the development of new interpretations of those requirements by the agencies that issue the permits, that could lead to delays, increased operating costs and process prohibitions that could reduce demand for our compression services, which would materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.. We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.. Our operations are subject to inherent risks such as equipment defects, malfunction and failures, and natural disasters that can result in uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids, fires and explosions. These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, death, property damage, pollution and other environmental damages. Our insurance may be inadequate to cover our liabilities. Further, insurance covering the risks we face or in the amounts we desire may not be available in the future or, if available, the premiums may not be commercially justifiable. If we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, or if we were to incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.. 24. Table of Contents. Terrorist attacks, the threat of terrorist attacks or other sustained military campaigns may adversely impact our results of operations.. The long-term impact of terrorist attacks and the magnitude of the threat of future terrorist attacks on the energy industry in general and on us in particular are not known at this time. Uncertainty surrounding sustained military campaigns may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of crude oil and natural gas supplies and markets for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and the possibility that infrastructure facilities could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. Changes in the insurance markets attributable to terrorist attacks may make certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain, if we choose to do so. Moreover, the insurance that may be available to us may be significantly more expensive than our existing insurance coverage. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war could also affect our ability to raise capital.. If we fail to develop or maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud, which would likely have a negative impact on the market price of our units.. In connection with the closing of our initial public offering, we became subject to the public reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a publicly traded partnership. We continue to evaluate the effectiveness of and improve upon our internal controls. Our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls may not be successful, and we may be unable to maintain effective controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (\"Section 404\"). For example, Section 404 requires us, among other things, to review and report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We were required to comply with Section 404(a) beginning with our fiscal year ended December 31, 2013. In addition, our independent registered public accountants will be required to assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting at the end of the fiscal year after we are no longer an \"emerging growth company\" under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, which will occur at the end of 2018. Any failure to develop, implement or maintain effective internal controls or to improve our internal controls could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Given the difficulties inherent in the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, we can provide no assurance as to our independent registered public accounting firm's conclusions about the effectiveness of our internal controls, and we may incur significant costs in our efforts to comply with Section 404. Ineffective internal controls will subject us to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of confidence in our reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on our business and would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our units.. Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us. Holders of our common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our general partner or its directors.. Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, our unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management's decisions regarding our business. Unitholders have no right to elect our general partner or its board of directors. USA Compression Holdings is the sole member of our general partner and has the right to appoint our general partner's entire board of directors, including its independent directors. If the unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they have little ability to remove our general partner. As a result of these limitations, the price of our common units may be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. Furthermore, our partnership agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders' ability to influence the manner or direction of management. If the GP Purchase is completed, all of the risks relative to USA Compression Holdings in this paragraph will subsequently apply to the Energy Transfer Parties.. 25. Table of Contents. The owner of our general partner has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. Our general partner and its affiliates, including the owner thereof, have conflicts of interest with us and limited fiduciary duties and they may favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our unitholders.. USA Compression Holdings, which is principally owned and controlled by Riverstone, owns and controls our general partner and appointed all of the officers and directors of our general partner, some of whom are also officers and directors of USA Compression Holdings. Although our general partner has a fiduciary duty to manage us in a manner that is beneficial to us and our unitholders, the directors and officers of our general partner have a fiduciary duty to manage our general partner in a manner that is beneficial to its owner. Conflicts of interest will arise between our general partner and its owner, on the one hand, and us and our unitholders, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts of interest, our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its owner over our interests and the interests of our unitholders. These conflicts include the following situations, among others:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tneither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires the owner of our general partner to pursue a business strategy that favors us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us, such as its owner, in resolving conflicts of interest;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour partnership agreement limits the liability of and reduces the fiduciary duties owed by our general partner, and also restricts the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that, without such limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texcept in limited circumstances, our general partner has the power and authority to conduct our business without unitholder approval;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, borrowings, issuance of additional partnership interests and the creation, reduction or increase of reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour general partner determines the amount and timing of any capital expenditures and whether a capital expenditure is classified as a maintenance capital expenditure, which reduces operating surplus, or an expansion capital expenditure, which does not reduce operating surplus. This determination can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders and to our general partner;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour general partner determines which costs incurred by it are reimbursable by us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour general partner may cause us to borrow funds in order to permit the payment of cash distributions, even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to make incentive distributions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour partnership agreement permits us to classify up to $36.6 million as operating surplus, even if it is generated from asset sales, non-working capital borrowings or other sources that would otherwise constitute capital surplus. This cash may be used to fund distributions as operating surplus from non-operating sources to our general partner in respect of its General Partner Interest (as defined under Part II, Item 5 (\"Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\") or the incentive distribution rights (or \"IDRs\");.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour general partner intends to limit its liability regarding our contractual and other obligations;. 26. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour general partner may exercise its right to call and purchase all of the common units not owned by it and its affiliates if they own more than 80% of the common units;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour general partner controls the enforcement of the obligations that it and its affiliates owe to us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour general partner may elect to cause us to issue common units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to the IDRs without the approval of the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner or our unitholders. This election may result in lower distributions to our common unitholders in certain situations.. Our general partner's liability regarding our obligations is limited.. Our general partner has included, and will continue to include, provisions in its and our contractual arrangements that limit its liability under such contractual arrangements so that the counterparties to such arrangements have recourse only against our assets, and not against our general partner or its assets. Our general partner may therefore cause us to incur indebtedness or other obligations that are nonrecourse to our general partner. Our partnership agreement provides that any action taken by our general partner to limit its liability is not a breach of our general partner's fiduciary duties, even if we could have obtained more favorable terms without the limitation on liability. In addition, we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify our general partner to the extent that it incurs obligations on our behalf. Any such reimbursement or indemnification payments would reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution.. Our partnership agreement limits our general partner's fiduciary duties to our unitholders.. Our partnership agreement contains provisions that modify and reduce the fiduciary standards to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to its capacity as our general partner, or otherwise free of fiduciary duties to us and our unitholders. This entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires and relieves it of any duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or our limited partners. Examples of decisions that our general partner may make in its individual capacity include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thow to allocate business opportunities among us and its affiliates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhether to exercise its limited call right;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thow to exercise its voting rights with respect to the units it owns;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhether to elect to reset target distribution levels; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhether or not to consent to any merger or consolidation of the Partnership or amendment to the partnership agreement.. By purchasing a unit, a unitholder agrees to become bound by the provisions in the partnership agreement, including the provisions discussed above.. Even if holders of our common units are dissatisfied, they currently cannot remove our general partner without USA Compression Holdings' consent.. The unitholders are currently unable to remove our general partner because our general partner and its affiliates own sufficient units to be able to prevent its removal. The vote of the holders of at least 662/3% of all outstanding common units is required to remove our general partner. USA Compression Holdings currently owns over 331/3% of our. 27. Table of Contents. outstanding common units and, after giving effect to the CDM Acquisition and the other transactions described in Item 1 (\"Business - Recent Developments\"), the Energy Transfer Parties will own over 331/3% of our outstanding common units.. Our partnership agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of our common units for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.. Our partnership agreement contains provisions that restrict the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty under state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovides that whenever our general partner makes a determination or takes, or declines to take, any other action in its capacity as our general partner, our general partner is required to make such determination, or take or decline to take such other action, in good faith, and will not be subject to any higher standard imposed by our partnership agreement, Delaware law, or any other law, rule or regulation, or at equity;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovides that our general partner will not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as a general partner so long as such decisions are made in good faith, meaning that it believed that the decisions were in the best interest of our partnership;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovides that our general partner and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us, our limited partners or their assignees resulting from any act or omission unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that our general partner or its officers and directors, as the case may be, acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the conduct was criminal; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovides that our general partner will not be in breach of its obligations under the partnership agreement or its fiduciary duties to us or our unitholders if a transaction with an affiliate or the resolution of a conflict of interest is:. (a) \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tapproved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner, although our general partner is not obligated to seek such approval;. (b) \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tapproved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding common units, excluding any common units owned by our general partner and its affiliates;. (c) \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ton terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties; or. (d) \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfair and reasonable to us, taking into account the totality of the relationships among the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us.. In connection with a situation involving a transaction with an affiliate or a conflict of interest, any determination by our general partner must be made in good faith. If an affiliate transaction or the resolution of a conflict of interest is not approved by our common unitholders or the conflicts committee and the board of directors of our general partner determines that the resolution or course of action taken with respect to the affiliate transaction or conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in subclauses (c) and (d) above, then it will conclusively be deemed that, in making its decision, the board of directors of our general partner acted in good faith.. 28. Table of Contents. Our general partner may elect to cause us to issue common units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to its IDRs, without the approval of the conflicts committee of its board of directors of our general partner or the holders of our common units. This could result in lower distributions to holders of our common units.. Our general partner has the right, at any time when it has received incentive distributions at the highest level to which it is entitled (48.0%) for each of the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters, to reset the initial target distribution levels at higher levels based on our distributions at the time of the exercise of the reset election. Following a reset election by our general partner, the minimum quarterly distribution will be adjusted to equal the reset minimum quarterly distribution, and the target distribution levels will be reset to correspondingly higher levels based on percentage increases above the reset minimum quarterly distribution.. If our general partner elects to reset the target distribution levels, it will be entitled to receive a number of common units and to maintain its general partner interest. The number of common units to be issued to our general partner will equal the number of common units which would have entitled the holder to an average aggregate quarterly cash distribution in the prior two quarters equal to the average of the distributions to our general partner on the IDRs in the prior two quarters. Our general partner's general partner interest in us (currently 1.2%) will be maintained at the percentage that existed immediately prior to the reset election. Our general partner could exercise this reset election at a time when it is experiencing, or expects to experience, declines in the cash distributions it receives related to its IDRs and may, therefore, desire to be issued common units rather than retain the right to receive incentive distributions based on the initial target distribution levels. As a result, a reset election may cause our common unitholders to experience a reduction in the amount of cash distributions that our common unitholders would have otherwise received had we not issued new common units to our general partner in connection with resetting the target distribution levels. On January 15, 2018, our general partner entered into an agreement pursuant to which it agreed to, among other things, convert the General Partner Interest into a non-economic general partner interest and cancel the IDRs. The transactions are expected to close in the first half of 2018. See Item 1 (\"Business - Recent Developments\") for more information.. Our partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20% or more of our common units.. Unitholders' voting rights are further restricted by a provision of our partnership agreement providing that any units held by a person or group that owns 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding, other than our general partner, its affiliates, their direct transferees and their indirect transferees approved by our general partner (which approval may be granted in its sole discretion) and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of our general partner, cannot vote on any matter.. Our general partner interest or the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.. Our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of the unitholders. Furthermore, our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of USA Compression Holdings to transfer all or a portion of its ownership interest in our general partner to a third party. The new owner of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of our general partner with its own designees and thereby exert significant control over the decisions made by the board of directors and officers of our general partner. On January 15, 2018, USA Compression Holdings entered into an agreement pursuant to which it agreed to, among other things, sell 100% of its ownership interests in our general partner to ETE. The transactions are expected to close in the first half of 2018. See Item 1 (\"Business - Recent Developments\") for more information.. An increase in interest rates may cause the market price of our common units to decline.. Like all equity investments, an investment in our common units is subject to certain risks. In exchange for accepting these risks, investors may expect to receive a higher rate of return than would otherwise be obtainable from lower-risk investments. Accordingly, as interest rates rise, the ability of investors to obtain higher risk-adjusted rates of return by purchasing government-backed debt securities may cause a corresponding decline in demand for riskier investments. 29. Table of Contents. generally, including yield based equity investments such as publicly traded partnership interests. Reduced demand for our common units resulting from investors seeking other more favorable investment opportunities may cause the trading price of our common units to decline.. We may issue additional units without the approval of the common unitholders, which would dilute your existing ownership interests.. Our partnership agreement does not limit the number or timing of additional limited partner interests that we may issue without the approval of our common unitholders. The issuance by us of additional common units, including pursuant to our Distribution Reinvestment Plan (\"DRIP\"), or other equity securities of equal or senior rank, will have the following effects:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour existing unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe market price of the common units may decline;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tassuming the distribution per unit remains unchanged or increases, the cash distributions to the holder of the IDRs will increase; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOn January 15, 2018, we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we agreed, among other things, to issue Preferred Units to certain investors. The transactions are expected to close in the first half of 2018. See Item 1 (\"Business - Recent Developments\") for more information.. USA Compression Holdings, Argonaut and the Energy Transfer Parties may sell units in the public or private markets, and such sales could have an adverse impact on the trading price of the common units.. As of December 31, 2017, USA Compression Holdings holds an aggregate of 25,092,196 common units. Argonaut Private Equity, L.L.C. (\"Argonaut\") holds an aggregate of 7,715,948 common units. In addition, USA Compression Holdings and Argonaut may acquire additional common units in connection with our DRIP. After giving effect to the CDM Acquisition and the other transactions described in Item 1 (\"Business - Recent Developments\"), the Energy Transfer Parties will own an aggregate of 46,056,228 common units (after giving effect to the conversion of 6,397,965 Class B Units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership), and USA Compression Holdings will own an aggregate of 12,625,284 common units. We have agreed to provide USA Compression Holdings and the Energy Transfer Parties with certain registration rights for any common units they own. The sale of these common units in the public or private markets could have an adverse impact on the price of the common units or on any trading market that may develop.. Our general partner has a call right that may require you to sell your common units at an undesirable time or price.. If at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units, our general partner will have the right, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, but not the obligation, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price that is not less than their then-current market price, as calculated pursuant to the terms of our partnership agreement. As a result, you may be required to sell your common units at an undesirable time or price. You may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of your units. USA Compression Holdings owns an aggregate of approximately 40% of our outstanding common units and, after giving effect to the CDM Acquisition and the other transactions described in Item 1 (\"Business - Recent Developments\"), the Energy Transfer Parties would own an aggregate of approximately 49% of our outstanding common units.. 30. Table of Contents. Your liability may not be limited if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of our business.. A general partner of a partnership generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership, except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to our general partner. Our partnership is organized under Delaware law, and we conduct business in a number of other states. The limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some of the other states in which we do business. You could be liable for any and all of our obligations as if you were a general partner if a court or government agency were to determine that:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe were conducting business in a state but had not complied with that particular state's partnership statute; or. <U+F020>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tyour right to act with other unitholders to remove or replace our general partner, to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or to take other actions under our partnership agreement constitute \"control\" of our business.. Unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them.. Under certain circumstances, unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (the \"Delaware Act\"), we may not make a distribution to you if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of an impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount. Neither liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interest nor liabilities that are non-recourse to the partnership are counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted.. The NYSE does not require a publicly traded partnership like us to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements.. Our common units are listed on the NYSE. Because we are a publicly traded partnership, the NYSE does not require us to have a majority of independent directors on our general partner's board of directors or to establish a compensation committee or a nominating and corporate governance committee. Accordingly, unitholders do not have the same protections afforded to investors in certain corporations that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements. Please read Part III, Item 10 (\"Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\").. Pursuant to certain federal securities laws, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 for so long as we are an emerging growth company.. We are required to disclose changes made in our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis, and we are required to assess the effectiveness of our controls annually. However, for as long as we are an \"emerging growth company\" under federal securities laws, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404. We will be an emerging growth company until the end of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. Even if we conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may still decline to attest to our assessment or may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our controls or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us.. 31. Table of Contents. Tax Risks to Common Unitholders. Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, then our cash available for distribution would be substantially reduced.. The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in the common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. We have not requested a ruling from the IRS on this or any other tax matter affecting us.. Despite the fact that we are a limited partnership under Delaware law, it is possible in certain circumstances for a partnership such as ours to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. Although we do not believe based upon our current operations that we are or will be so treated, a change in our business or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity.. If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, and would likely pay state and local income tax at varying rates. Distributions would generally be taxed again as corporate dividends (to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits), and no income, gains, losses, deductions or credits would flow through to you. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution would be substantially reduced. Therefore, if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, there would be a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units.. Our partnership agreement provides that, if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for federal, state or local income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us.. If we were subjected to a material amount of additional entity level taxation by individual states, it would reduce our cash available for distribution.. Changes in current state law may subject us to additional entity level taxation by individual states. Because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons, several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation. For example, we are required to pay the Revised Texas Franchise Tax each year at a maximum effective rate of 0.75% of our \"margin\", as defined in the law, apportioned to Texas in the prior year. Imposition of any similar taxes by any other state may substantially reduce the cash available for distribution and, therefore, negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units.. The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes or differing interpretations, possibly applied on a retroactive basis.. The present federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretation at any time. From time to time, members of the U.S. Congress propose and consider such substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. Although there is no current legislative proposal, a prior legislative proposal would have eliminated the qualifying income exception to the treatment of all publicly traded partnerships as corporations upon which we rely for our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.. In addition, on January 24, 2017, final regulations regarding which activities give rise to qualifying income within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code (the \"Final Regulations\") were published in the Federal Register. The Final Regulations are effective as of January 19, 2017, and apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 19, 2017. We do not believe the Final Regulations affect our ability to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.. 32. Table of Contents. However, any modification to the federal income tax laws may be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to meet the exception for certain publicly traded partnerships to be treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted. Any similar or future legislative changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units. You are urged to consult with your own tax advisor with respect to the status of regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on your investment in our common units.. Our unitholders' share of our income will be taxable to them for federal income tax purposes even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us.. Because a unitholder will be treated as a partner to whom we will allocate taxable income that could be different in amount than the cash we distribute, a unitholder's allocable share of our taxable income will be taxable to it, which may require the payment of federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes, on its share of our taxable income even if it receives no cash distributions from us. Our unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income.. We may engage in transactions to de-lever the Partnership and manage our liquidity that may result in income and gain to our unitholders. For example, if we sell assets and use the proceeds to repay existing debt or fund capital expenditures, you may be allocated taxable income and gain resulting from the sale. Further, taking advantage of opportunities to reduce our existing debt, such as debt exchanges, debt repurchases, or modifications of our existing debt could result in \"cancellation of indebtedness income\" (also referred to as \"COD income\") being allocated to our unitholders as taxable income. Unitholders may be allocated COD income, and income tax liabilities arising therefrom may exceed cash distributions. The ultimate effect of any such allocations will depend on the unitholder's individual tax position with respect to its units. Unitholders are encouraged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the consequences of potential COD income or other transactions that may result in income and gain to unitholders.. If the IRS contests the federal income tax positions we take, the market for our common units may be adversely impacted and the cost of any IRS contest will reduce our cash available for distribution.. We have not requested a ruling from the IRS with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or any other matter affecting us. The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the positions we take, and the IRS's positions may ultimately be sustained.. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take. A court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take. Any contest with the IRS, and the outcome of any IRS contest, may have a materially adverse impact on the market for our common units and the price at which they trade. In addition, our costs of any contest with the IRS will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution.. If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, it (and some states) may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustments directly from us, in which case our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced.. Pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns, it (and some states) may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustments directly from us. To the extent possible under the new rules, our general partner may elect to either pay the taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly to the IRS or, if we are eligible, issue a revised information statement to each unitholder and former unitholder with respect to an audited and adjusted return. Although our general partner may elect to have our unitholders and former unitholders take such audit adjustment into account and pay any resulting taxes (including applicable penalties or interest) in accordance with their interests in us during the tax year under audit, there can be no assurance that such election will be practical, permissible or effective in all circumstances. As a result, our current unitholders may bear some or all of the tax liability resulting from such audit adjustment, even if such unitholders did not own units in us during the tax year under audit. If, as a result of any such audit adjustment, we are required to make payments of taxes,. 33. Table of Contents. penalties and interest, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be reduced. These rules are not applicable for tax years beginning on or prior to December 31, 2017.. Tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected.. If our unitholders sell common units, they will recognize a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the amount realized and their tax basis in those common units. Because distributions in excess of their allocable share of our net taxable income decrease their tax basis in their common units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the common units a unitholder sells will, in effect, become taxable income to the unitholder if it sells such common units at a price greater than its tax basis in those common units, even if the price received is less than its original cost. In addition, because the amount realized includes a unitholder's share of our nonrecourse liabilities, a unitholder that sells common units may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash received from the sale.. A substantial portion of the amount realized from a unitholder's sale of our units, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income to such unitholder due to potential recapture items, including depreciation recapture. Thus, a unitholder may recognize both ordinary income and capital loss from the sale of units if the amount realized on a sale of such units is less than such unitholder's adjusted basis in the units. Net capital loss may only offset capital gains and, in the case of individuals, up to $3,000 of ordinary income per year. In the taxable period in which a unitholder sells its units, such unitholder may recognize ordinary income from our allocations of income and gain to such unitholder prior to the sale and from recapture items that generally cannot be offset by any capital loss recognized upon the sale of units.. Unitholders may be subject to a limitation on their ability to deduct interest expense incurred by us.. In general, we are entitled to a deduction for interest paid or accrued on indebtedness properly allocable to our trade or business during our taxable year. However, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, our deduction for \"business interest\" is limited to the sum of our business interest income and 30% of our \"adjusted taxable income.\" For the purposes of this limitation, our adjusted taxable income is computed without regard to any business interest expense or business interest income, and in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 2022, any deduction allowable for depreciation, amortization, or depletion.. Tax-exempt entities face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.. Investment in our common units by tax-exempt entities, such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (known as IRAs) raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from U.S. federal income tax, including IRAs and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them. Further, with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, a tax-exempt entity with more than one unrelated trade or business (including by attribution from investment in a partnership such as ours that is engaged in one or more unrelated trade or business) is required to compute the unrelated business taxable income of such tax-exempt entity separately with respect to each such trade or business (including for purposes of determining any net operating loss deduction). As a result, for years beginning after December 31, 2017, it may not be possible for tax-exempt entities to utilize losses from an investment in our partnership to offset unrelated business taxable income from another unrelated trade or business and vice versa. Tax-exempt entities should consult a tax advisor before investing in our common units.. Non-U.S. Unitholders will be subject to U.S. taxes and withholding with respect to their income and gain from owning our units.. Non-U.S. unitholders are generally taxed and subject to income tax filing requirements by the U.S. on income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business (\"effectively connected income\"). Income allocated to our unitholders and any gain from the sale of our units will generally be considered to be \"effectively connected\" with a U.S. trade or business. As a result, distributions to a Non-U.S. unitholder will be subject to withholding at the highest applicable. 34. Table of Contents. effective tax rate and a Non-U.S. unitholder who sells or otherwise disposes of a unit will also be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the gain realized from the sale or disposition of that unit.. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act imposes a withholding obligation of 10% of the amount realized upon a Non-U.S. unitholder's sale or exchange of an interest in a partnership that is engaged in a U.S. trade or business. However, due to challenges of administering a withholding obligation applicable to open market trading and other complications, the IRS has temporarily suspended the application of this withholding rule to open market transfers of interests in publicly traded partnerships pending promulgation of regulations or other guidance that resolves the challenges. It is not clear if or when such regulations or other guidance will be issued. Non-U.S. unitholders should consult a tax advisor before investing in our common units.. We will treat each purchaser of common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units.. Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units, we have adopted certain methods for allocating depreciation and amortization deductions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury Regulations. A successful IRS challenge to the use of these methods could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to you. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from your sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to your tax returns.. We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction for federal income tax purposes between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.. We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction for federal income tax purposes between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month (the \"Allocation Date\"), instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. Similarly, we generally allocate certain deductions for depreciation of capital additions, gain or loss realized on a sale or other disposition of our assets and, in the discretion of the general partner, any other extraordinary item of income, gain, loss or deduction based upon ownership on the Allocation Date. Treasury Regulations allow a similar monthly simplifying convention, but such regulations do not specifically authorize all aspects of our proration method. If the IRS were to challenge our proration method, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.. A unitholder whose common units are the subject of a securities loan (e.g., a loan to a \"short seller\" to cover a short sale of common units) may be considered as having disposed of those common units. If so, he would no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.. Because there are no specific rules governing the federal income tax consequences of loaning a partnership interest, a unitholder whose common units are the subject of a securities loan may be considered as having disposed of the loaned common units, he may no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those common units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a securities loan are urged to consult a tax advisor to discuss whether it is advisable to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their common units.. 35. Table of Contents. We have adopted certain valuation methodologies in determining unitholder's allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction. The IRS may challenge these methods or the resulting allocations, and such a challenge could adversely affect the value of our common units.. In determining the items of income, gain, loss and deduction allocable to our unitholders, we must routinely determine the fair market value of our assets. Although we may from time to time consult with professional appraisers regarding valuation matters, we make many fair market value estimates using a methodology based on the market value of our common units as a means to measure the fair market value of our assets. The IRS may challenge these valuation methods and the resulting allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction.. A successful IRS challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the timing or amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders. It also could affect the amount of gain recognized from our unitholders' sale of common units, have a negative impact on the value of the common units, or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders' tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions.. As a result of investing in our common units, you will likely become subject to state and local taxes and income tax return filing requirements in jurisdictions where we operate or own or acquire properties.. In addition to federal income taxes, our unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes, including state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or control property now or in the future, even if they do not live in any of those jurisdictions. Our unitholders will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions. Further, our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with state and local filing requirements.. We currently conduct business in several states, many of which currently impose a personal income tax on individuals. Many of these states also impose an income tax on corporations and other entities. As we make acquisitions or expand our business, we may control assets or conduct business in additional states or foreign jurisdictions that impose a personal income tax. It is your responsibility to file all foreign, federal, state and local tax returns.. Risks Related to the CDM Acquisition. Our pending acquisition of CDM may not be consummated.. Our pending acquisition of CDM is expected to close in the first half of 2018 and is subject to closing conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the acquisition will not be consummated. If the closing of the acquisition is substantially delayed or does not occur at all, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition fully or at all. Certain of the conditions remaining to be satisfied include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe continued accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Contribution Agreement;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe performance by each party of its obligations under the Contribution Agreement; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe absence of any order from any governmental authority that enjoins or otherwise prohibits, or of any law being enacted which would enjoin or prohibit, the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Contribution Agreement.. In addition, the Contribution Agreement may be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties or by either us or ETP (i) if the acquisition has not closed on or before June 30, 2018 (subject to a 90 day extension by either party if the regulatory approvals have not then been obtained or certain other conditions have not been satisfied) (the \"Outside Date\"), (ii) if the other has breached its obligations under the Contribution Agreement, which breaches have not been cured within 30 days, (iii) if any order from any governmental authority permanently prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby has become final and non-appealable or (iv) if the GP Purchase Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.. 36. Table of Contents. The closing of the CDM Acquisition is not subject to a financing condition and the Bridge Loans do not backstop the equity portion of the purchase price.. The closing of the CDM Acquisition is not subject to a financing condition; however, the Series A Purchase Agreement contains a condition to closing that we will have increased the aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facility to (or entered into a similar revolving facility with minimum aggregate commitments of) at least $1.3 billion. The Series A Purchase Agreement, the proceeds of which are to fund a portion of the purchase price of the CDM Acquisition, and the Bridge Loans, which is available to backstop a portion of the CDM Acquisition purchase price that we expect to fund with the net proceeds of other debt financing, is each subject to certain closing conditions. Furthermore, the Bridge Commitment does not backstop the equity portion of the purchase price. The Bridge Commitment will expire upon the earliest to occur of (1) the Outside Date as defined in the Contribution Agreement (as the same may be extended thereunder), (2) the consummation of the CDM Acquisition without use of the Bridge Loans, (3) the termination of the Contribution Agreement in accordance with its terms or (4) September 30, 2018. Although obtaining the equity or debt financing is not a condition to the completion of the CDM Acquisition, our failure to have sufficient funds available to pay the purchase price is likely to result in the failure of the CDM Acquisition to be completed or could require us to sell assets in order to satisfy our obligations to close.. The representations, warranties, and indemnifications by ETP are limited in the Contribution Agreement and our diligence of CDM may not identify all material matters related to CDM; as a result, the assumptions on which our estimates of future results of CDM's business have been based may prove to be incorrect in a number of material ways, resulting in us not realizing the expected benefits of the CDM Acquisition.. The representations and warranties by ETP are limited in the Contribution Agreement and our diligence into CDM's business may not identify all material matters related to CDM. In addition, the Contribution Agreement does not provide any indemnities other than those described therein. As a result, the assumptions on which our estimates of future results of CDM's business have been based may prove to be incorrect in a number of material ways, resulting in us not realizing our expected benefits of the CDM Acquisition, including anticipated increased cash flow.. Financing the CDM Acquisition will substantially increase our indebtedness. We may not be able to obtain debt financing for the acquisition on expected or acceptable terms, which would make the acquisition less accretive.. We intend to finance the CDM Acquisition and related fees and expenses with the proceeds of the issuance of debt and equity, including the private placement of Preferred Units, and, to the extent necessary or desirable, with borrowing under our revolving credit facility, other debt financing, borrowings under the Bridge Loans, and/or cash on hand. After completion of the CDM Acquisition, we expect our total outstanding indebtedness will increase from approximately $782.9 million as of December 31, 2017 to approximately $1.6 billion. The increase in our indebtedness may reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to fund capital expenditures or working capital needs.. We intend to raise long term debt in advance of closing of the CDM Acquisition. The assumptions underlying our estimate that the CDM Acquisition will be accretive to our distributable cash flow includes assumptions about the interest rate we will be able to obtain in connection with such long term debt. We may not be able to obtain debt financing for the acquisition on expected or acceptable terms, which would make the acquisition less accretive than anticipated.. The CDM Acquisition could expose us to additional unknown and contingent liabilities.. The acquisition of CDM could expose us to additional unknown and contingent liabilities. We have performed a certain level of due diligence in connection with the CDM Acquisition and have attempted to verify the representations made by ETP, but there may be unknown and contingent liabilities related to CDM of which we are unaware. ETP has not agreed to indemnify us for losses or claims relating to the operation of the business or otherwise except to the limited extent described in the Contribution Agreement. There is a risk that we could ultimately be liable for unknown obligations relating to CDM for which indemnification is not available, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flow.. 37. Table of Contents. We may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other employees in light of the CDM Acquisition.. Uncertainty about the effect of the CDM Acquisition on employees of us or CDM may have an adverse effect on us. This uncertainty may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel until the CDM Acquisition is completed. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the CDM Acquisition, as employees may feel uncertain about their future roles with the combined organization. In addition, we or CDM may have to provide additional compensation in order to retain employees. If employees of us or CDM depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to become employees of the combined organization, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the CDM Acquisition could be adversely affected.. We are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the proposed CDM Acquisition is pending, which could adversely affect our business and operations.. In connection with the pending CDM Acquisition, it is possible that some customers, suppliers and other persons with whom we or CDM have business relationships may delay or defer certain business decisions, or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationship with us or CDM as a result of the CDM Acquisition, which could negatively affect our revenue, earnings and cash available for distribution, as well as the market price of our common units, regardless of whether the CDM Acquisition is completed.. Under the terms of the Contribution Agreement, we and CDM are each subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our businesses prior to completing the CDM Acquisition, which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies. Such limitations could negatively affect each party's business and operations prior to the completion of the CDM Acquisition. Furthermore, the process of planning to integrate the acquired entity for the post-acquisition period can divert management attention and resources and could ultimately have an adverse effect on each party.. We will incur substantial transaction-related costs in connection with the CDM Acquisition.. We expect to incur a number of non-recurring transaction-related costs associated with completing the CDM Acquisition and achieving desired synergies. These fees and costs will be substantial. Non-recurring transaction costs include, but are not limited to, fees paid to legal, financial and accounting advisors, lender and other financing fees, filing fees and printing costs. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of CDM's business. There can be no assurance that the elimination of certain duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the acquired entity, will offset the incremental transaction-related costs over time. Thus, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, the long term or at all."
