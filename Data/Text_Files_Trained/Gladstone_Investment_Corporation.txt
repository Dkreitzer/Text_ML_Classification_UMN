[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report and the other reports and documents filed by us with the SEC. The risks set out below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or not presently deemed material by us, may also impair our operations and performance. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In such case, our NAV and the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risk factors described below are the principal risk factors associated with an investment in our securities as well as those factors generally associated with an investment company with investment objectives, investment policies, capital structure or trading markets similar to ours.. Risks Related to Our Investments. We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.. A large number of entities compete with us to make the types of investments we seek to make in Lower Middle Market companies. We generally compete with public and private buyout funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies, and, to the extent that they provide an alternative form of financing, hedge funds, mutual funds, and private equity. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which would allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC. The competitive pressures we face could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, as a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objective. We do not seek to compete based on the interest rates we offer and we believe that some of our competitors may make loans with interest rates that will be comparable to or lower than the rates we offer. We may lose investment opportunities if we do not match our competitors' pricing, terms, and structure. However, if we match our competitors' pricing, terms, and structure, we may experience decreased net interest income and increased risk of credit loss.. Our investments in Lower Middle Market portfolio companies are extremely risky and could cause you to lose all or a part of your investment.. Investments in Lower Middle Market portfolio companies are subject to a number of significant risks including the following:. <U+0095>   Lower Middle Market businesses are likely to be more significantly impacted in economic downturns than larger businesses. Our portfolio companies may have fewer resources than larger businesses, and any economic downturns or recessions, are more likely to have a material adverse effect on them. In the event that the economy contracts, it is likely that the financial results of Lower Middle Market businesses, like those in which we invest, could experience deterioration or limited growth from current levels, which could ultimately lead to difficulty in meeting their debt service requirements and an increase in defaults. Consequently, if one of our portfolio companies is adversely impacted by a recession, its ability to repay our loan(s) or engage in a liquidity event, such as a sale, recapitalization or initial public offering would be diminished.. <U+0095>   Lower Middle Market businesses may have limited financial resources and may not be able to repay the loans we make to them. Our strategy includes providing financing to portfolio companies that typically do not have readily available access to financing. While we believe that this provides an attractive opportunity for us to generate profits, this may make it difficult for the portfolio companies to repay their loans to us upon maturity. A borrower's ability to repay its loan(s) may be adversely affected by numerous factors, including the failure to meet its business plan, a downturn in its industry or negative economic conditions. Deterioration in a borrower's financial condition and prospects usually will be accompanied by deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of realizing on any guaranties we may have obtained from the borrower's management. As of March 31, 2018, certain loans to two portfolio companies were on non-accrual status with an aggregate debt cost basis of $15.6 million, or 3.6%, of the cost basis of all debt investments in our portfolio. While we are working with the portfolio companies to improve their profitability and cash flows, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prove successful. Although we will generally seek to be a secured first lien lender to a borrower, in some of our loans we expect to be subordinated to a senior lender and our security interest in any collateral would, accordingly, likely be second lien and subordinate to another lender's security interest.. 19. Table of Contents. <U+0095>   Lower Middle Market businesses typically have narrower product lines and smaller market shares than large businesses. Our target portfolio companies tend to be more vulnerable to competitors' actions and market conditions, as well as general economic downturns. In addition, our portfolio companies may face intense competition, including competition from companies with greater financial resources, more extensive development, manufacturing, marketing and other capabilities and a larger number of qualified managerial and technical personnel.. <U+0095>   There is generally little or no publicly available information about these businesses. Because we seek to invest in privately owned businesses, there is generally little or no publicly available operating and financial information about our potential portfolio companies. As a result, we rely on our officers, the Adviser and its employees, Gladstone Securities and consultants to perform due diligence investigations of these portfolio companies, their operations, and their prospects. We may not learn all of the material information we need to know regarding these businesses through our investigations to make a well-informed investment decision.. <U+0095>   Lower Middle Market businesses generally have less predictable operating results. We expect that our portfolio companies may have significant variations in their operating results, may from time to time be exposed to litigation, may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence, may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, to finance expansion or to maintain their competitive position, may otherwise have a weak financial position or may be adversely affected by changes in the business cycle. Our portfolio companies may not meet net income, cash flow and other coverage tests typically imposed by their senior lenders. A borrower's failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by senior lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, foreclosure on its senior credit facility, which could additionally trigger cross-defaults in other agreements. If this were to occur, it is possible that the borrower's ability to repay our loan(s) would be jeopardized.. <U+0095>   Lower Middle Market businesses are more likely to be dependent on one or two persons. Typically, the success of a Lower Middle Market business also depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two persons or a small group of persons. The death, disability or resignation of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on our borrower and, in turn, on us.. <U+0095>   Lower Middle Market businesses may have limited operating histories. While we intend to continue to target stable companies with proven track records, we may make loans to new companies that meet our other investment criteria. Portfolio companies with limited operating histories will be exposed to all of the operating risks that new businesses face and may be particularly susceptible to, among other risks, market downturns, competitive pressures and the departure of key executive officers.. <U+0095>   Debt securities of Lower Middle Market companies typically are not rated by a credit rating agency. Typically, a Lower Middle Market business cannot or will not expend the resources to have their debt securities rated by a credit rating agency. We expect that most, if not all, of the debt securities we acquire will be unrated. Investors should assume that these loans would be at rates below what is today considered \"investment grade\" quality. Investments rated below investment grade are often referred to as high yield securities or junk bonds and may be considered high risk as compared to investment grade debt instruments.. Because the loans we make and equity securities we invest in are not publicly traded, there is uncertainty regarding the value of our privately held securities that could adversely affect our determination of our NAV.. Substantially all of our portfolio investments are, and we expect will continue to be, in the form of securities that are not publicly traded. The fair value of securities and other investments that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable. Our Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving, in good faith, the fair value of our investments, based on the Policy. Our Board of Directors reviews valuation recommendations that are provided by the Valuation Team. In valuing our investment portfolio, several techniques are used, including, but not limited to, a total enterprise value approach, a yield analysis, and market quotes. Currently, ICE Data Pricing and Reference Data, LLC (formerly Standard and Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc.) provides estimates of fair value on generally all of our debt investments that are not valued using total enterprise value (\"TEV\") and we use another independent valuation firm to provide valuation inputs for our significant equity investments, generally valued using TEV, including earnings multiple ranges, as well as other information. In addition to these techniques, inputs and information, other factors are considered when determining fair value of our investments, including but not limited to: the nature and realizable value of the collateral, including external parties' guaranties; any relevant offers or letters of intent to acquire the portfolio company; timing of expected loan repayments; and the markets in which the portfolio company operates. If applicable, new and follow-on debt and equity investments made during the current three month reporting period are generally valued at original cost basis. Refer to \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  -  Critical Accounting Policy  -  Investment Valuation\" for additional information on our valuation policies, procedures, and processes.. 20. Table of Contents. Fair value measurements of our investments may involve subjective judgments and estimates and, due to the uncertainty inherent in valuing these securities, the Adviser's determination of fair value may fluctuate from period to period and may differ materially from the values that could be obtained if a ready market for these securities existed. Additionally, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investment may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned.. Our NAV would be adversely affected if the fair value of our investments that are approved by our Board of Directors are higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon the disposal of such securities.. Our most recent NAV was calculated on March 31, 2018 and our NAV when calculated effective June 30, 2018 and thereafter may be higher or lower.. As of March 31, 2018, our NAV per share was $10.85, which was based on the fair value of our investments that were reviewed and approved by the Valuation Committee and Board of Directors in connection with financial statements that were audited by our independent registered public accounting firm. NAV per share as of June 30, 2018 may be higher or lower than $10.85 based on potential changes in valuations, issuance of shares of common stock subsequent to March 31, 2018, or dividends paid and earnings for the quarter then ended. Our Board of Directors determines the fair value of our portfolio investments on a quarterly basis and if our June 30, 2018 fair value is less than the March 31, 2018 fair value, we will record an unrealized loss on our investment portfolio. If the fair value is greater, we will record an unrealized gain on our investment portfolio. Upon publication of our next quarterly NAV per share determination (generally in our next Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), the market price of our common stock may fluctuate materially.. The valuation process for certain of our portfolio holdings creates a conflict of interest.. A substantial portion of our portfolio investments are securities that are not publicly traded. As a result, our Board of Directors determines the fair value of these securities in good faith pursuant to the Policy. In connection with that determination, our Valuation Team prepares portfolio company valuations based upon the most recent portfolio company financial statements available and projected financial results of each portfolio company. The participation of our Adviser's investment professionals in our valuation process and Mr. Gladstone's pecuniary interest in our Adviser may result in a conflict of interest, as the management fees that we pay our Adviser are based on our average gross assets, less uninvested cash or cash equivalents from borrowings, and adjusted appropriately for any share issuances or repurchases during the period.. The lack of liquidity of our privately held investments may adversely affect our business.. We will generally make investments in private companies whose securities are not traded in any public market. Substantially all of the investments we presently hold and the investments we expect to acquire in the future are, and will be, subject to legal and other restrictions on resale and will otherwise be less liquid than publicly-traded securities. The illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to quickly obtain cash equal to the value at which we record our investments if the need arises. This could cause us to miss important investment opportunities. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may record substantial realized losses upon liquidation. We may also face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a portfolio company to the extent that we, the Adviser, the Administrator, or our respective officers, or affiliates have material non-public information regarding such portfolio company.. Due to the uncertainty inherent in valuing these securities, the Adviser's determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that could be obtained if a ready market for these securities existed. Our NAV could be materially affected if the Adviser's determinations regarding the fair value of our investments are materially different from the values that we ultimately realize upon our disposal of such securities. Additional discussion regarding risks associated with determinations made by the Adviser is found in the risk factor \"The valuation process for certain of our portfolio holdings creates a conflict of interest.\". Our financial results could be negatively affected if a significant portfolio investment fails to perform as expected.. Our total investment in one or more companies may be significant individually or in the aggregate. As a result, if a significant investment in one or more companies fails to perform as expected, our financial results could be more negatively affected and the magnitude of the loss could be more significant than if we had made smaller investments in more companies. Our five largest investments represented 30.5% of the fair value of our total portfolio as of March 31, 2018, compared to 27.4% as of March 31, 2017.. Any disposition of a significant investment in one or more portfolio companies may negatively impact our net investment income and limit our ability to pay distributions.. 21. Table of Contents. The tightening of the U.S. monetary policy through the increase in the Federal Reserve System (\"Fed\") interest rate has resulted in several interest rate raises of 25 basis points each. The increase in the Fed rate can have a negative effect on our investments by making it harder and more expensive to refinance capital structures or even obtain financing.. In recent years, the Fed has incrementally raised the target range for the federal funds rate to its current range of 1.5% to 1.75%, with additional increases expected to come over the next year. As interest rates increase, generally, the cost of borrowing increases, affecting our ability to make new investments on favorable terms or at all. More generally, interest rate fluctuations and changes in credit spreads on floating rate loans may have a negative impact on our investments and investment opportunities and, accordingly, may have a material adverse effect on our rate of return on invested capital, our net investment income, our net asset value and the market price of our securities. A substantial portion of our debt investments have variable interest rates that reset periodically and are generally based on LIBOR, so an increase in interest rates from the current interest rate may make it more difficult for our portfolio companies to service their obligations under the debt investments that we hold. To the extent that interest rates increase, this may negatively impact the operating performance of our portfolio companies due to increasing debt service obligations and, therefore, may affect our results of operations. In addition, to the extent that an increase in interest rates makes it difficult or impossible to make payments on outstanding indebtedness to us or other financial sponsors or refinance debt that is maturing in the near term, some of our portfolio companies may be unable to repay such debt at maturity and may be forced to sell assets, undergo a recapitalization or seek bankruptcy protection. There can be no guaranty the Fed will raise rates at the gradual pace they originally proposed, nor can there be any assurance that the Fed will make sound decisions as to when to raise rates. The increase in interest rates could have a negative effect on our investments, which could negatively impact our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.. The interest rates of some of our term loans to our portfolio companies are priced using a spread over LIBOR, which may be phased out in the future.. LIBOR is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. In general, our investments in debt securities have a term of five years, accrue interest at variable rates based on LIBOR and, to a lesser extent, at fixed rates. As of March 31, 2018, our loan portfolio consisted of 97.0% variable rate loans with floors and 3.0% fixed rate loans based on the total principal balance of all outstanding debt investments.. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time whether or not LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The Fed, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, announced replacement of U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by U.S. Treasury securities called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"). The first publication of SOFR was released in April 2018. Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question and the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate the loan documents with our portfolio companies that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established.. We generally will not be involved in the day-to-day operations and decision making of our portfolio companies.. We generally are not, and do not expect to be, involved in the day-to-day operations and decision making of our portfolio companies, even though we may have board representation or board observation rights and our debt agreements may contain certain restrictive covenants. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company in which we invest may make business decisions with which we disagree and the management of such company, as representatives of the holders of their common stock, may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests of maximizing our investment value.. We typically invest in transactions involving acquisitions, buyouts and recapitalizations of companies, which will subject us to the risks associated with change in control transactions.. Our strategy, in part, includes making debt and equity investments in companies in connection with acquisitions, buyouts and recapitalizations, which subjects us to the risks associated with change in control transactions. Change in control transactions often present a number of uncertainties. Companies undergoing change in control transactions often face challenges retaining key employees and maintaining relationships with customers and suppliers. While we hope to avoid many of these difficulties by participating in transactions where the management team is retained and by conducting thorough due diligence in advance of our decision to invest, if our portfolio companies experience one or more of these problems, we may not realize the value that we expect in connection with our investments, which would likely harm our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.. 22. Table of Contents. Our portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies and/or we could be subject to lender liability claims.. We primarily invest in secured first and second lien debt securities issued by our portfolio companies. In some cases, portfolio companies will be permitted to have other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the debt securities in which we invest. By their terms, such debt securities may provide that the holders thereof are entitled to receive payment of interest and principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments in respect of the debt securities in which we invest. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization, or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution in respect of our investment. Additionally, depending on the facts and circumstances, including the extent to which we provide managerial assistance to any portfolio company subject to bankruptcy, a bankruptcy court might re-characterize our debt investments and subordinate all or a portion of our claims to that of other creditors. After repaying such senior creditors, such portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. We may also be subject to lender liability claims for actions taken by us with respect to a borrower's business or in instances in which we exercised control over the borrower as a result of actions taken in rendering any managerial assistance. Furthermore, in the case of debt ranking equally with debt securities in which we invest, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization, or bankruptcy of a portfolio company.. Prepayments of our investments by our portfolio companies could adversely impact our results of operations and reduce our return on investment.. In addition to risks associated with delays in investing our capital, to a lesser extent, we are also subject to the risk that investments we make in our portfolio companies may be repaid prior to maturity. During the fiscal year 2018, we experienced prepayments of term debt investments of $13.6 million. We will first use any proceeds from prepayments to repay any borrowings outstanding on the Credit Facility. In the event that funds remain after repayment of our outstanding borrowings, then we may reinvest these proceeds in government securities, pending their future investment in new debt and/or equity securities. These government securities will typically have substantially lower yields than the debt securities being prepaid and we could experience significant delays in reinvesting these amounts. As a result, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if one or more of our portfolio companies elect to prepay amounts owed to us. While we generally do not provide for prepayments of our debt investments where we also own a significant equity investment in a portfolio company, prepayments allowable under pure debt investments could negatively impact our return on those investments, which could negatively impact our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows and could lead to a decline in the market price of our common stock.. Our portfolio is concentrated in a limited number of companies and industries, which subjects us to an increased risk of significant loss if any one of these companies does not repay us or if the industries experience downturns.. As of March 31, 2018, we had investments in 33 portfolio companies, the five largest of which included Cambridge, Nth Degree, JR Hobbs, Brunswick, and ImageWorks, and comprised $183.4 million, or 30.5%, of our total investment portfolio, at fair value. A consequence of a limited number of investments is that the aggregate returns we realize may be substantially adversely affected by the unfavorable performance of a small number of such investments or a substantial write-down of any one investment. Beyond our regulatory and income tax diversification requirements, as well as Credit Facility requirements, we do not have fixed guidelines for industry concentration and our investments could potentially be concentrated in relatively few industries. In addition, while we do not intend to invest 25% or more of our total assets in a particular industry or group of industries at the time of investment, it is possible that as the values of our portfolio companies change, one industry or a group of industries may comprise in excess of 25% of the value of our total assets. A downturn in a particular industry in which we have invested a significant portion of our total assets could have a materially adverse effect on us. As of March 31, 2018, our largest industry concentration was in Diversified/Conglomerate Services, representing 22.8% of our total investments, at fair value.. Our investments are typically long term and will require several years to realize liquidation events.. Since we generally make five to seven year term loans and hold our loans and equity positions until the loans mature and/or we exit the investment, investors should not expect realization events, if any, to occur over the near term. In addition, we expect that any equity investments may require several years to appreciate in value and we cannot give any assurance that such appreciation will occur.. 23. Table of Contents. The disposition of our investments may result in contingent liabilities.. Currently, all but one of our investments involve private securities. In connection with the disposition of an investment in private securities, we may be required to make representations about the business and financial affairs of the underlying portfolio company typical of those made in connection with the sale of a business. We may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment to the extent that any such representations turn out to be inaccurate or with respect to certain potential liabilities. These arrangements may result in contingent liabilities that may ultimately yield funding obligations that must be satisfied through our return of certain distributions previously made to us.. Portfolio company-related litigation could result in costs, including defense costs or damages, and the diversion of management time and resources.. In the course of investing in and often providing significant managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies, certain persons employed by the Adviser sometimes serve as directors on the boards of such companies. To the extent that litigation arises out of our investments in these companies, even if meritless, we or such employees may be named as defendants in such litigation, which could result in additional costs, including defense costs, and the diversion of management time and resources. We may be unable to accurately estimate our exposure to litigation risk if we record balance sheet reserves for probable loss contingencies. As a result, any reserves we establish to cover any settlements or judgments may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure, which may have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal actions and regulatory matters, we cannot provide assurance as to the outcome of any threatened or pending matter or, if resolved adversely, the costs associated with any such matter, particularly where the claimant seeks very large or indeterminate damages or where the matter presents novel legal theories, involves a large number of parties or is at a preliminary stage. The resolution of any such matters may be time consuming, expensive, and may distract management from the conduct of our business. The resolution of certain threatened or pending legal actions or regulatory matters, if unfavorable, whether in settlement or a judgment, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows for the quarter in which such actions or matters are resolved or a reserve is established.. While the Company believes it would have valid defenses to potential claims brought due to our investment in any portfolio company, and will defend any such claims vigorously, it may nevertheless expend significant amounts of money in defense costs and expenses. Further, if the Company enters into settlements or suffers an adverse outcome in any litigation, the Company could be required to pay significant amounts. In addition, if any of the Company's portfolio companies become subject to direct or indirect claims or other obligations, such as defense costs or damages in litigation or settlement, the Company's investment in such companies could diminish in value and the Company could suffer indirect losses. Further, these matters could cause the Company to expend significant management time and effort in connection with assessment and defense of any claims. No range of potential expenses, costs or damages in connection with these matters can be estimated at this time.. We may not realize gains from our equity investments and other yield enhancements.. We generally make equity investments in combination with secured debt investments. We may also receive other equity interests to purchase stock issued by the portfolio company, such as warrants, and will generally receive other yield enhancements, such as success fees. Our goal is to ultimately dispose of these equity interests and realize gains and collect the yield enhancements. We expect that, over time, the realized gains from the disposition of equity interests and the yield enhancements we collect will offset any losses we may experience on potential loan defaults. However, equity interests may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value and any other yield enhancements, such as success fees, may not be collected. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests or collect other yield enhancements and any gains we do recognize and yield enhancements we collect may not be sufficient to offset losses we experience on other debt and equity investments.. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded net realized gains on investments of $1.3 million and $15.6 million, respectively. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, we recorded a net realized loss on investments of $4.6 million. There can be no guaranties that such net realized gains can be achieved in future periods and the impact of such sales on our results of operations in prior periods should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, success fee income totaled $5.3 million, $2.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively.. 24. Table of Contents. Any unrealized depreciation we experience on our investment portfolio may be an indication of future realized losses, which could reduce any gains available for distribution.. As a BDC we are required to carry our investments at market value or, if no market value is ascertainable, at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our Board of Directors. We will record decreases in the market values or fair values of our investments as unrealized depreciation. Since our inception, we have, at times, incurred a cumulative net unrealized depreciation of our portfolio. Any unrealized depreciation in our investment portfolio could result in realized losses in the future and ultimately in reductions of any gains available for distribution to stockholders in future periods.. Risks Related to Our External Financing. In addition to regulatory limitations on our ability to raise capital, the Credit Facility contains various covenants which, if not complied with, could accelerate our repayment obligations under the facility, thereby materially and adversely affecting our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and ability to pay distributions.. We will have a continuing need for capital to finance our investments. As of March 31, 2018, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Business Investment, had $107.0 million in borrowings, at cost, outstanding under the Credit Facility, which provides for maximum borrowings of $165.0 million, with a revolving period end date of November 15, 2019 (the \"Revolving Period End Date\"). The Credit Facility permits us to fund additional loans and investments as long as we are within the conditions and covenants set forth in the credit agreement. Among other things, the Credit Facility contains covenants that require Business Investment to maintain its status as a separate legal entity, prohibit certain significant corporate transactions (such as mergers, consolidations, liquidations or dissolutions) and restrict certain material changes to our credit and collection policy without the lenders' consent. The Credit Facility also generally seeks to restrict distributions to stockholders to the sum of (i) our net investment income, (ii) net capital gains, and (iii) amounts deemed by the Company to be considered as having been paid during the prior fiscal year in accordance with Section 855(a) of the Code. Loans eligible to be pledged as collateral are subject to certain limitations, including, among other things, restrictions on geographic concentrations, industry concentrations, loan size, payment frequency and status, average life, portfolio company leverage, and lien property. The Credit Facility also requires Business Investment to comply with other financial and operational covenants, which obligate Business Investment to, among other things, maintain certain financial ratios, including asset and interest coverage and a minimum number of obligors required in the borrowing base. Additionally, the Credit Facility contains a performance guaranty that requires the Company to maintain (i) a minimum net worth (defined in the Credit Facility to include our mandatory redeemable term preferred stock) of the greater of $210.0 million or $210.0 million plus 50% of all equity and subordinated debt raised minus 50% of any equity or subordinated debt redeemed or retired after November 16, 2016, which equated to $221.2 million as of March 31, 2018, (ii) asset coverage with respect to senior securities representing indebtedness of at least 200% (or such higher percentage as may be set forth in Section 18 of the 1940 Act), and (iii) our status as a BDC under the 1940 Act and as a RIC under the Code. As of March 31, 2018, and as defined in the performance guaranty of the Credit Facility, we had a net worth of $488.8 million, an asset coverage ratio on our senior securities representing indebtedness of 525.7%, calculated in compliance with the requirements of Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act, and an active status as a BDC and RIC. As of March 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility; however, our continued compliance depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.. Given the continued uncertainty in the capital markets, any unrealized depreciation in our portfolio may increase in future periods and threaten our ability to comply with the minimum net worth covenant and other covenants under the Credit Facility. Our failure to satisfy these covenants could result in foreclosure by our lenders, which would accelerate our repayment obligations under the facility and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.. Any inability to renew, extend or replace the Credit Facility on terms favorable to us, or at all, could adversely impact our liquidity and ability to fund new investments or maintain distributions to our stockholders.. If the Credit Facility is not renewed or extended by the Revolving Period End Date, all principal and interest will be due and payable on or before November 15, 2021 (two years after the Revolving Period End Date). Subject to certain terms and conditions, the Credit Facility may be expanded to a total of $250 million through additional commitments of existing or new lenders. However, if such lenders are unwilling to provide additional commitments under the terms of the Credit Facility, we will be unable to expand the Credit Facility and thus will continue to have limited availability to finance new investments under the Credit Facility. There can be no guaranty that we will be able to renew, extend or replace the Credit Facility upon its Revolving Period End Date on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. Our ability to expand the Credit Facility, and to obtain replacement financing at or before the time of its Revolving Period End Date, will be constrained by then current economic conditions affecting the credit markets. In the event that we are not able to expand the Credit Facility, or to renew, extend or refinance the Credit Facility by the Revolving Period End Date, this. could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to fund new investments, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and our ability to qualify as a RIC under the Code.. 25. Table of Contents. If we are unable to secure replacement financing, we may be forced to sell certain assets on disadvantageous terms, which may result in realized losses, and such realized losses could materially exceed the amount of any unrealized depreciation on these assets as of our most recent balance sheet date, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Such circumstances would also increase the likelihood that we would be required to redeem some or all of our outstanding mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, which could potentially require us to sell more assets. In addition to selling assets, or as an alternative, we may issue common equity in order to repay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility. Depending upon the trading prices of our common stock, such an equity offering may have a dilutive impact on our existing stockholders' interest in our earnings, assets and voting interest in us. If we are able to renew, extend or refinance the Credit Facility prior to maturity, renewal, extension or refinancing, it could potentially result in significantly higher interest rates and related charges and may impose significant restrictions on the use of borrowed funds to fund investments or maintain distributions to common and preferred stockholders.. Because we expect to distribute substantially all of our Investment Company Taxable Income, at least 90%, on an annual basis, our business plan is dependent upon external financing, which is constrained by the limitations of the 1940 Act.. Although we completed equity offerings of our Series D Term Preferred Stock, Series C Term Preferred Stock and Series B Term Preferred Stock in September 2016, May 2015 and November 2014, respectively, a common stock offering in May 2017, and initiated our at-the-market program in February 2018, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise capital through issuing equity in the near future. Our business requires a substantial amount of cash to operate and grow. We may acquire such additional capital from the following sources:. <U+0095>   Senior Securities: We may issue senior securities representing indebtedness (including borrowings under the Credit Facility) and senior securities that are stock (including our Series B Term Preferred Stock, Series C Term Preferred Stock, and Series D Term Preferred Stock), up to the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act currently permits us, as a BDC, to issue senior securities representing indebtedness and senior securities which are stock, in amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in Section 18(h) of the 1940 Act, is at least 200% (currently) or 150% (effective April 10, 2019; refer to \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  -  Overview  -  Recent Developments  -  Small Business Credit Availability Act\" for a discussion of changes to the asset coverage requirements pursuant to the SBCAA) on each such senior security immediately after each issuance of each such senior security. As a result of incurring indebtedness (in whatever form), we will be exposed to the risks associated with leverage. Although borrowing money for investments increases the potential for gain, it also increases the risk of a loss. A decrease in the value of our investments will have a greater impact on the value of our common stock to the extent that we have borrowed money to make investments. There is a possibility that the costs of borrowing could exceed the income we receive on the investments we make with such borrowed funds. In addition, our ability to pay distributions, issue senior securities or repurchase shares of our common stock would be restricted if the asset coverage on each of our senior securities is not at least 200%. If the aggregate fair value of our assets declines, we might be unable to satisfy that 200% requirement. To satisfy the 200% asset coverage requirement in the event that we are seeking to pay a distribution, we might either have to (i) liquidate a portion of our loan portfolio to repay a portion of our indebtedness or (ii) issue common stock. This may occur at a time when a sale of a portfolio asset may be disadvantageous, or when we have limited access to capital markets on agreeable terms. In addition, any amounts that we use to service our indebtedness or for offering costs will not be available for distributions to stockholders. Furthermore, if we have to issue common stock below NAV per common share, any non-participating stockholders will be subject to dilution, as described below. Pursuant to Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of senior securities representing indebtedness. However, pursuant to Section 18(c) of the 1940 Act, we are permitted to issue only one class of senior securities that are stock.. <U+0095>    Common and Convertible Preferred Stock: Because we are constrained in our ability to issue debt or senior securities for the reasons given above, we are dependent on the issuance of equity as a financing source. If we raise additional funds by issuing more common stock, the percentage ownership of our common stockholders at the time of the issuance would decrease and our existing common stockholders may experience dilution. In addition, under the 1940 Act, we will generally not be able to issue additional shares of our common stock at a price below NAV per common share to purchasers, other than to our existing common stockholders through a rights offering, without first obtaining the approval of our stockholders and our independent directors. If we were to sell shares of our common stock below our then current NAV per common share, as we did at times during March 2018 under the at-the-market program, and in other offerings in May 2017, March 2015, and October 2012, such sales would result in an immediate dilution to the NAV per common share. This dilution would occur as a result of the sale of common shares at a price below the then current NAV per share of our common stock and a proportionately greater decrease in a common stockholder's interest in our earnings and assets and voting percentage than. 26. Table of Contents. the increase in our assets resulting from such issuance. For example, if we issue and sell an additional 10% of our common stock at a 5% discount from NAV, a common stockholder who does not participate in that offering for its proportionate interest will suffer NAV dilution of up to 0.5% or $5 per $1,000 of NAV. This imposes constraints on our ability to raise capital when our common stock is trading below NAV per common share, as it generally has for the last several years. As noted above, the 1940 Act prohibits the issuance of multiple classes of senior securities that are stock. As a result, we would be prohibited from issuing convertible preferred stock to the extent that such a security was deemed to be a separate class of stock from our outstanding mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. Refer to \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  -  Overview  -  Recent Developments  -  At-the-Market Program\" for a discussion of our at-the-market program.. We financed certain of our investments with borrowed money and capital from the issuance of senior securities, which will magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us.. The following table illustrates the effect of leverage on returns from an investment in our common stock assuming various annual returns on our portfolio, net of expenses. The calculations in the table below are hypothetical and actual returns may be higher or lower than those appearing in the table below.. Assumed Return on Our Portfolio (Net of Expenses)        (10 )%      (5 )%      0 %      5 %      10 %                                                     Corresponding return to common stockholder(A)      (21.4 )%      (12.8 )%      (4.2 )%      4.4 %      13.1 %. (A) The hypothetical return to common stockholders is calculated by multiplying our total assets as of March 31, 2018 by the assumed rates of return and subtracting all interest on our debt and dividends on our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock expected to be paid or declared during the twelve months following March 31, 2018; and then dividing the resulting difference by our total net assets attributable to common stock as of March 31, 2018. Based on $610.9 million in total assets, $107.0 million in borrowings outstanding on the Credit Facility, at cost, $5.1 million in a secured borrowing, $41.4 million in aggregate liquidation preference of Series B Term Preferred Stock, $40.3 million in aggregate liquidation preference of Series C Term Preferred Stock, $57.5 million in aggregate liquidation preference of Series D Term Preferred Stock, and $354.2 million in net assets as of March 31, 2018.. Based on an aggregate outstanding indebtedness of $112.1 million at principal as of March 31, 2018, the effective annual interest rate of 5.2% as of that date, and aggregate liquidation preference of our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of $139.2 million, our investment portfolio at fair value would have to produce an annual return of at least 2.5% to cover annual interest payments on the outstanding debt and dividends on our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.. A change in interest rates may adversely affect our profitability and hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks.. We anticipate using a combination of equity and long-term and short-term borrowings to finance our investment activities. As a result, a portion of our income will depend upon the spread between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we loan these funds. An increase or decrease in interest rates could reduce the spread between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow, and thus, adversely affect our profitability, if we have not appropriately hedged against such event. Alternatively, interest rate hedging arrangements may limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the hedged portfolio.. Ultimately, we expect approximately 90.0% of the loans in our portfolio to be at variable rates determined on the basis of the LIBOR and approximately 10.0% to be at fixed rates. As of March 31, 2018, based on the total principal balance of debt investments outstanding, our portfolio consisted of 97.0% of loans at variable rates with floors and 3.0% at fixed rates.. As of March 31, 2018, we did not have any hedging arrangement, such as interest rate hedges. While hedging arrangements may insulate us against adverse fluctuations in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the hedged portfolio. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or any future hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Our ability to receive payments pursuant to a hedging arrangement is linked to the ability of the counter-party to that hedging arrangement to make the required payments. To the extent that the counter-party to the hedging arrangement is unable to pay pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we may lose the hedging protection of the arrangement.. Also, the fair value of certain of our debt investments is based, in part, on the current market yields or interest rates of similar securities. A change in interest rates could have a significant impact on our determination of the fair value of these debt investments. In addition, a change in interest rates could also have an impact on the fair value of any hedging arrangements then in effect that could result in the recording of unrealized appreciation or depreciation in future periods. Therefore, adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Refer to \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" for additional information on interest rate fluctuations.. 27. Table of Contents. Risks Related to Our Regulation and Structure. We will be subject to corporate-level tax if we are unable to satisfy Code requirements for RIC qualification.. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must maintain our status as a BDC and meet annual distribution, income source, and asset diversification requirements. The annual distribution requirement is satisfied if we distribute at least 90% of our Investment Company Taxable Income to our stockholders on an annual basis. Because we use leverage, we are subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements under the 1940 Act and could, under certain circumstances, be restricted from making distributions necessary to qualify as a RIC. Warrants we may receive with respect to debt investments generally create original issue discount (\"OID\"), which we must recognize as ordinary income over the term of the debt investment. Similarly, PIK interest which is accrued generally over the term of the debt investment but not paid in cash, is recognized as ordinary income. Both OID and PIK interest will increase the amounts we are required to distribute to maintain our RIC status. Because such OIDs and PIK interest will not produce distributable cash for us at the same time as we are required to make distributions, we will need to use cash from other sources to satisfy such distribution requirements. As of March 31, 2018, we did not have investments with OID or a PIK feature. Additionally, we must meet asset diversification and income source requirements at the end of each calendar quarter. If we fail to meet these tests, we may need to quickly dispose of certain investments to prevent the loss of RIC status. Since most of our investments will be illiquid, such dispositions, if even possible, may not be made at prices advantageous to us and, in fact, may result in substantial losses. If we fail to qualify as a RIC as of a calendar quarter or annually for any reason and become fully subject to corporate income tax, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution, and the actual amount distributed. Such a failure would have a material adverse effect on us and our common stock. Refer to \"Business  -  Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations  -  RIC Status\" for additional information regarding asset coverage ratio and RIC requirements and to \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  -  Overview  -  Recent Developments  -  Small Business Credit Availability Act\" for a discussion of changes to the asset coverage requirements pursuant to the SBCAA.. Some of our debt investments may include success fees that would generally generate payments to us upon a change of control. Because the satisfaction of these success fees, and the ultimate payment of these fees, is uncertain and highly contingent, we generally only recognize them as income when the payment is received. Success fee amounts are characterized as ordinary income for tax purposes and, as a result, we are required to distribute such amounts to our stockholders in order to maintain our RIC status.. If we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in \"qualifying assets,\" we could fail to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act or be precluded from investing according to our current business strategy.. As a BDC, we may not acquire any assets other than \"qualifying assets\" unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such acquisition, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets, as defined in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act.. We believe that most of the investments that we may acquire in the future will constitute qualifying assets. However, we may be precluded from investing in what we believe to be attractive investments if such investments are not qualifying assets for purposes of the 1940 Act. If we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets, we could violate the 1940 Act provisions applicable to BDCs. As a result of such violation, specific rules under the 1940 Act could prevent us, for example, from making follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies (which could result in the dilution of our position) or could require us to dispose of investments at inappropriate times in order to come into compliance with the 1940 Act. If we need to dispose of such investments quickly, it could be difficult to dispose of such investments on favorable terms. We may not be able to find a buyer for such investments and, even if we do find a buyer, we may have to sell the investments at a substantial loss. Any such outcomes would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. If we do not maintain our status as a BDC, we would be subject to regulation as a registered closed-end investment company under the 1940 Act. As a registered closed-end investment company, we would be subject to substantially more regulatory restrictions under the 1940 Act, which would significantly decrease our operating flexibility. Refer to \"Business  -  Regulation as a BDC  -  Qualifying Assets\" for additional information regarding qualifying assets.. 28. Table of Contents. Changes in laws or regulations governing our operations, or changes in the interpretation thereof, and any failure by us to comply with laws or regulations governing our operations may adversely affect our business.. We, and our portfolio companies, are subject to regulation by laws at the local, state and federal levels. These laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation, may be changed from time to time. Accordingly, any change in these laws or regulations, or their interpretation, or any failure by us or our portfolio companies to comply with these laws or regulations may adversely affect our business. Refer to \"Business - Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations  -  RIC Status\" and \"Business  -  Regulation as a BDC\" for additional information regarding the regulations to which we are subject.. Provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could restrict a change in control and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.. We are subject to provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law that, in general, prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15% or more of our common stock for three years unless the holder's acquisition of our stock was either approved in advance by our Board of Directors or ratified by our Board of Directors and stockholders owning two-thirds of our outstanding stock not owned by the acquiring holder. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.. We have also adopted other measures that may make it difficult for a third party to obtain control of us, including provisions of our certificate of incorporation classifying our Board of Directors in three classes serving staggered three-year terms, and provisions of our certificate of incorporation authorizing our Board of Directors to induce the issuance of additional shares of our stock. These provisions, as well as other provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, may delay, defer, or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.. We may not be permitted to declare a dividend or make any distribution to stockholders or repurchase shares until such time as we satisfy the asset coverage tests under the provisions of the 1940 Act that apply to BDCs. As a BDC, we have the ability to issue senior securities only in amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% (or 150%, provided certain conditions are met) after each issuance of senior securities. If the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy this test. If that happens, we may be required to sell a portion of our investments and, depending on the nature of our leverage, repay a portion of our debt at a time when such sales and/or repayments may be disadvantageous.. Regulations governing our operation as a BDC and RIC will affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise, additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth. As a result of the annual distribution requirement to qualify as a RIC, we may need to periodically access the capital markets to raise cash to fund new investments. We may issue senior securities representing indebtedness, including borrowing money from banks or other financial institutions, or senior securities that are stock, such as our Series B Term Preferred Stock, our Series C Term Preferred Stock, and our Series D Term Preferred Stock, only in amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% (currently) or 150% (effective April 10, 2019; refer to \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  -  Overview - Recent Developments  -  Small Business Credit Availability Act\" for a discussion of changes to the asset coverage requirements pursuant to the SBCAA) after each such incurrence or issuance. Further, we may not be permitted to declare a dividend or make any distribution to our outstanding stockholders or repurchase shares until such time as we satisfy this test. Our ability to issue different types of securities is also limited. Compliance with these requirements may unfavorably limit our investment opportunities and reduce our ability in comparison to other companies to profit from favorable spreads between the rates at which we can borrow and the rates at which we can lend. As a BDC, therefore, we intend to continuously issue equity at a rate more frequent than our privately owned competitors, which may lead to greater stockholder dilution. We have incurred leverage to generate capital to make additional investments. If the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy the asset coverage test under the 1940 Act, which could prohibit us from paying distributions and could prevent us from qualifying as a RIC. If we cannot satisfy the asset coverage test, we may be required to sell a portion of our investments and, depending on the nature of our debt financing, repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when such sales and repayments may be disadvantageous.. Recently-enacted legislation allows us to incur additional leverage under the 1940 Act, distinct from certain of our obligations under our Credit Facility and our three series of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.. Historically, as a BDC, under the 1940 Act, we are generally required to maintain asset coverage of 200% for senior securities representing indebtedness (i.e., debt) or stock (i.e., preferred stock). On March 23, 2018, President Trump signed into legislation the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, also known as the \"omnibus spending package.\" Included in Title VIII therein is the Small Business Credit Availability Act that includes certain regulations under the federal securities laws impacting BDCs. Among other items, the Small Business Credit Availability Act allows a BDC to increase the amount of debt it may incur by modifying the asset coverage percentage from 200% to 150% (subject to specific approval and disclosure requirements).. 29. Table of Contents. On April 10, 2018, our Board of Directors, including a \"required majority\" (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) thereof, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Small Business Credit Availability Act. As a result, the Company's asset coverage requirements for senior securities will be changed from 200% to 150%, effective one year after the date of the Board of Director's approval; or on April 10, 2019. Therefore, we may be able to issue an increased amount of senior securities and incur additional indebtedness in the future and, therefore, your risk of an investment in us may increase.. Notwithstanding the modified asset coverage leverage ratio under the 1940 Act described above, we remain subject to a minimum asset coverage requirement of 200% with respect to certain provisions of our Credit Facility and our three series of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. If we drop below the 200% minimum asset coverage requirement, we may under certain circumstances be required to repay all outstanding indebtedness under our Credit Facility and redeem our three series of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. Such events, if they were to occur, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. The recently enacted legislation informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other legislative, regulatory and administrative developments may adversely affect the Company or its stockholders.. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law P.L. 115-97, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act makes major changes to the Code, including a number of provisions of the Code that affect the taxation of RICs and their stockholders. Certain provisions of the Tax Act that may impact us and our stockholders include:. <U+0095>   temporarily reducing individual U.S. federal income tax rates on ordinary income; the highest individual U.S. federal income tax rate will be reduced from 39.6% to 37% (through taxable years ending in 2025);. <U+0095>   reducing the maximum corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%;. <U+0095>   permitting a deduction for certain pass-through business income, which generally will allow individuals, trusts, and estates to deduct up to 20% of such amounts, resulting in an effective maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 29.6% on such dividends (through taxable years ending in 2025);. <U+0095>   limiting the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of taxable income (prior to the application of the dividends paid deduction);. <U+0095>   amending the limitation on the deduction of net interest expense for all businesses, other than certain electing businesses; and. <U+0095>   eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax.. The individual and collective impact of these provisions and other provisions of the Tax Act on the Company and its stockholders is uncertain, and may not become evident for some period of time. In addition, other legislative, regulatory or administrative changes may be enacted or promulgated, either prospectively or with retroactive effect, and may adversely affect the Company or its stockholders. The Company's stockholders should consult their individual tax advisors regarding the implications of the Tax Act and other potential legislative, regulatory or administrative changes on their investment in the Company's stock.. Risks Related to Our External Management. We are dependent upon our key management personnel and the key management personnel of the Adviser, particularly David Gladstone, David Dullum and Terry Lee Brubaker, and on the continued operations of the Adviser, for our future success.. We have no employees. Our chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer and treasurer, chief valuation officer, and the employees of the Adviser, do not spend all of their time managing our activities and our investment portfolio. We are particularly dependent upon David Gladstone, David Dullum and Terry Lee Brubaker for their experience, skills, and networks. Our executive officers and the employees of the Adviser allocate some, and in some cases a material portion, of their time to businesses and activities that are not related to our business. We have no separate facilities and are completely reliant on the Adviser, which has significant discretion as to the implementation and execution of our business strategies and risk management practices. We are subject. 30. Table of Contents. to the risk of discontinuation of the Adviser's operations or termination of the Advisory Agreement and the risk that, upon such event, no suitable replacement will be found. We believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the Adviser and that discontinuation of its operations or the loss of its key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objectives.. Our success depends on the Adviser's ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in a competitive environment.. The Adviser experiences competition in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly investment professionals and senior executives, and we may be unable to maintain or grow our business if we cannot attract and retain such personnel. The Adviser's ability to attract and retain personnel with the requisite credentials, experience and skills depends on several factors including, but not limited to, its ability to offer competitive wages, benefits and professional growth opportunities. The Adviser competes with investment funds (such as private equity funds and mezzanine funds) and traditional financial services companies for qualified personnel, many of which have greater resources than us. Searches for qualified personnel may divert management's time from the operation of our business. Strain on the existing personnel resources of the Adviser, in the event that it is unable to attract experienced investment professionals and senior executives, could have a material adverse effect on our business.. We are dependent upon the contacts and relationships of the Adviser to provide us with potential investment opportunities.. We depend upon the Adviser to maintain its relationships with private equity sponsors, placement agents, investment banks, management groups and other financial institutions, and we expect to rely to a significant extent upon these relationships to provide us with potential investment opportunities. If the Adviser or members of our investment team fail to maintain such relationships, or to develop new relationships with other sources of investment opportunities, we will not be able to grow our investment portfolio. In addition, individuals with whom the Adviser has relationships are not obligated to provide us with investment opportunities, and we can offer no assurance that these relationships will generate investment opportunities for us in the future. Failure of the Adviser to maintain such relationships or enter into new relationships that would generate additional investment opportunities, could have a material adverse effect on our business.. The Adviser can resign on 60 days' notice, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations.. The Adviser has the right to resign under the Advisory Agreement at any time upon not less than 60 days' written notice, whether we have found a replacement or not. If the Adviser resigns, we may not be able to find a new investment adviser or hire internal management with similar expertise and ability to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms within 60 days, or at all. If we are unable to do so quickly, our operations are likely to experience a disruption, our financial condition, business and results of operations as well as our ability to pay distributions are likely to be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock may decline. In addition, the coordination of our internal management and investment activities is likely to suffer if we are unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by the Adviser and its affiliates. Even if we are able to retain comparable management, whether internal or external, the integration of such management and their lack of familiarity with our investment objective may result in additional costs and time delays that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. Our incentive fee may induce the Adviser to make certain investments, including speculative investments.. The management compensation structure that has been implemented under the Advisory Agreement may cause the Adviser to invest in high-risk investments or take other investment risks. In addition to its management fee, the Adviser is entitled under the Advisory Agreement to receive incentive compensation based in part upon our achievement of specified levels of income. In evaluating investments and other management strategies, the opportunity to earn incentive compensation based on net investment income may lead the Adviser to place undue emphasis on the maximization of net investment income at the expense of other criteria, such as preservation of capital, maintaining sufficient liquidity, or management of credit risk or market risk, in order to achieve higher incentive compensation. Investments with higher yield potential are generally riskier or more speculative. This could result in increased risk to the value of our investment portfolio.. We may be obligated to pay the Adviser incentive compensation even if we incur a net decrease in net assets.. The Advisory Agreement entitles the Adviser to incentive compensation for each fiscal quarter in an amount equal to a percentage of the excess of our net investment income for that quarter (before deducting the incentive fee) above a threshold return of 1.75% of our net assets, as adjusted, for that quarter. When calculating our incentive fee, our pre-incentive fee net investment income excludes realized losses and unrealized depreciation that we may incur in the fiscal quarter, even if such losses or depreciation result in a net. 31. Table of Contents. decrease in net assets on our statement of operations for that quarter. Thus, we may be required to pay the Adviser incentive compensation for a fiscal quarter even if there is a decline in the value of our portfolio or we incur a net realized or unrealized loss for that quarter. For additional information on incentive compensation under the Advisory Agreement with the Adviser, see \"Business  -  Investment Advisory and Management Agreement.\". We may be required to pay the Adviser incentive compensation on income accrued, but not yet received in cash.. The part of the incentive fee payable by us that relates to our net investment income is computed and paid on income that may include income that has been accrued but not yet received in cash, such as debt instruments with PIK interest. If a portfolio company defaults on a loan, it is possible that such accrued interest previously used in the calculation of the incentive fee will become uncollectible. Consequently, we may make incentive fee payments on income accruals that we may not collect in the future and with respect to which we do not have a clawback right against the Adviser. During the years ended March 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we did not record any PIK income or any other non-cash income, nor did we collect any PIK interest in cash.. The Adviser's failure to identify and invest in securities that meet our investment criteria or perform its responsibilities under the Advisory Agreement would likely adversely affect our ability for future growth.. Our ability to achieve our investment objectives will depend on our ability to grow, which in turn will depend on the Adviser's ability to identify and invest in securities that meet our investment criteria. Accomplishing this result on a cost-effective basis will be largely a function of the Adviser's structuring of the investment process, its ability to provide competent and efficient services to us, and our access to financing on acceptable terms. The senior management team of the Adviser has substantial responsibilities under the Advisory Agreement. In order to grow, the Adviser will need to hire, train, supervise, and manage new employees successfully. Any failure to manage our future growth effectively would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows.. There are significant potential conflicts of interest, including with the Adviser, which could impact our investment returns.. Our executive officers and directors, and the officers and directors of the Adviser, serve or may serve as officers, directors, or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do or of investment funds managed by our affiliates. Accordingly, they may have obligations to investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which might not be in the best interests of us or our stockholders. For example, Mr. Gladstone, our chairman and chief executive officer, is the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the Adviser and Administrator, and the Affiliated Public Funds. In addition, Mr. Brubaker, our vice chairman and chief operating officer, is the vice chairman and chief operating officer of the Adviser and Administrator, and the Affiliated Public Funds. Mr. Dullum, our president, is an executive managing director of the Adviser. Moreover, the Adviser may establish or sponsor other investment vehicles which from time to time may have potentially overlapping investment objectives with ours and accordingly may invest in, whether principally or secondarily, asset classes we target. While the Adviser generally has broad authority to make investments on behalf of the investment vehicles that it advises, the Adviser has adopted investment allocation procedures to address these potential conflicts and intends to direct investment opportunities to the Company or the Affiliated Public Fund with the investment strategy that most closely fits the investment opportunity. Nevertheless, the management of the Adviser may face conflicts in the allocation of investment opportunities to other entities managed by the Adviser. As a result, it is possible that we may not be given the opportunity to participate in certain investments made by other funds managed by the Adviser. Our Board of Directors approved a revision of our investment objectives and strategies that became effective on January 1, 2013, which may enhance the potential for conflicts in the allocation of investment opportunities to us and other entities managed by the Adviser.. In certain circumstances, we may make investments in a portfolio company in which one of our affiliates has or will have an investment, subject to satisfaction of any regulatory restrictions and, where required, the prior approval of our Board of Directors. As of March 31, 2018, our Board of Directors has approved the following types of transactions:. <U+0095>   Our affiliate, Gladstone Commercial, may, under certain circumstances, lease property to portfolio companies that we do not control. We may pursue such transactions only if (i) the portfolio company is not controlled by us or any of our affiliates, (ii) the portfolio company satisfies the tenant underwriting criteria of Gladstone Commercial, and (iii) the transaction is approved by a majority of our independent directors and a majority of the independent directors of Gladstone Commercial. We expect that any such negotiations between Gladstone Commercial and our portfolio companies would result in lease terms consistent with the terms that the portfolio companies would be likely to receive were they not portfolio companies of ours.. <U+0095>   We may invest simultaneously with our affiliate Gladstone Capital in senior loans in the broadly syndicated market whereby neither we nor any affiliate has the ability to dictate the terms of the loans.. 32. Table of Contents. <U+0095>   Pursuant to the Co-Investment Order, we may co-invest, under certain circumstances, with certain of our affiliates, including Gladstone Capital and any future BDC or closed-end management investment company that is advised (or sub-advised if it controls the fund) by the Adviser, or any combination of the foregoing subject to the conditions in the SEC's order.. Certain of our officers, who are also officers of the Adviser, may from time to time serve as directors of certain of our portfolio companies. If an officer serves in such capacity with one of our portfolio companies, such officer will owe fiduciary duties to stockholders of the portfolio company, which duties may from time to time conflict with the interests of our stockholders.. In the course of our investing activities, we will pay management and incentive fees to the Adviser and will reimburse the Administrator for certain expenses it incurs. As a result, investors in our common stock will invest on a \"gross\" basis and receive distributions on a \"net\" basis after expenses, resulting in, among other things, a lower rate of return than one might achieve through our investors themselves making direct investments. As a result of this arrangement, there may be times when the management team of the Adviser has interests that differ from those of our stockholders, giving rise to a conflict. In addition, as a BDC, we make available significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and provide other services to such portfolio companies. While neither we nor the Adviser currently receive fees in connection with managerial assistance, the Adviser and Gladstone Securities have, at various times, provided other services to certain of our portfolio companies and received fees for services other than managerial assistance as discussed in \"Business  -  Ongoing Management of Investment Portfolio Company Relationships  -  Managerial Assistance and Services.\". The Adviser is not obligated to provide credits of the base management fee or incentive fees, which could negatively impact our earnings and our ability to maintain our current level of distributions to our stockholders.. The Advisory Agreement provides for a base management fee, based on our gross assets, and an incentive fee, that is based on our income and capital gains. Our Board of Directors has accepted in the past and may accept in the future non-contractual, unconditional, and irrevocable credits to reduce the annual 2.0% base management fee or the incentive fee, on a quarterly or annual basis. Any fees credited may not be recouped by the Adviser in the future. However, the Adviser is not required to issue these or other credits of fees under the Advisory Agreement. If the Adviser does not issue these credits in the future, it could negatively impact our earnings and may compromise our ability to maintain our current level of distributions to our stockholders, which could have a material adverse impact on our common stock price.. Our business model is dependent upon developing and sustaining strong referral relationships with investment bankers, business brokers and other intermediaries and any change in our referral relationships may impact our business plan.. We are dependent upon informal relationships with investment bankers, business brokers and traditional lending institutions to provide us with deal flow. If we fail to maintain our relationship with such funds or institutions, or if we fail to establish strong referral relationships with other funds, we will not be able to grow our portfolio of investments and fully execute our business plan.. Our base management fee may induce the Adviser to incur leverage.. The fact that our base management fee is payable based upon our gross assets, which would include any investments made with proceeds of borrowings, may encourage the Adviser to use leverage to make additional investments. Under certain circumstances, the use of increased leverage may increase the likelihood of default, which would disfavor holders of our securities. Given the subjective nature of the investment decisions made by the Adviser on our behalf, we will not be able to monitor this potential conflict of interest.. Risks Related to an Investment in Our Securities. We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results.. We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results due to a number of factors, including, among others, variations in our investment income, the level of our expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, placing and removing investments on non-accrual status, the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets, the ability to sell investments at attractive terms, the ability to fund and close suitable investments, and general economic conditions, including the impacts of inflation. The majority of our portfolio companies are in industries that are directly impacted by inflation, such as manufacturing and consumer goods and services. Our portfolio companies may not be able to pass on to customers increases in their costs of production which could greatly affect their operating results, impacting their ability to service and repay our loans. In addition, any potential future decreases in our portfolio companies' operating results due to inflation could adversely impact the fair value of those investments. Any decreases in the fair value of our investments could result in future realized and unrealized losses and therefore reduce our net assets. As a result of these factors, results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods.. 33. Table of Contents. There is a risk that you may not receive distributions or that distributions may not grow over time.. Our current intention is to distribute up to 100% of our Investment Company Taxable Income to our stockholders by paying monthly distributions. We may retain some or all of our net realized long-term capital gains, if any, or retain and designate them as deemed distributions to supplement our equity capital and support the growth of our portfolio, although our Board of Directors may determine to distribute these net realized long-term capital gains to our stockholders in cash. In addition, the Credit Facility restricts the amount of distributions we are permitted to make annually. We cannot assure investors that we will achieve investment results or maintain a tax status that will allow or require any specified level of cash distributions.. Investing in our securities may involve an above average degree of risk.. The investments we make in accordance with our investment objective may result in a higher amount of risk than alternative investment options and a higher risk of volatility or loss of principal. Our investments in portfolio companies may be highly speculative, and therefore, an investment in our common stock may not be suitable for someone with lower risk tolerance.. Distributions to our common stockholders have included and may in the future include a return of capital.. Our Board of Directors declares monthly common distributions each quarter based on estimates of Investment Company Taxable Income and capital gains for each fiscal year, which may differ, and in the past have differed, from actual results. Because our common distributions are based on estimates of Investment Company Taxable Income and capital gains that may differ from actual results, future common distributions payable to our common stockholders may include a return of capital. To the extent that we distribute amounts that exceed our accumulated earnings and profits, these distributions constitute a return of capital. A return of capital represents a return of a common stockholder's original investment in common shares of our stock and should not be confused with a distribution from earnings and profits. Although return of capital distributions may not be taxable, such distributions may increase an investor's tax liability for capital gains upon the sale of our common stock by reducing the investor's tax basis for such common stock. Such returns of capital reduce our asset base and also adversely impact our ability to raise debt capital as a result of the leverage restrictions under the 1940 Act, which could have a material adverse impact on our ability to make new investments.. The issuance of subscription rights to our existing stockholders may dilute the ownership and voting powers of existing stockholders in our common stock, dilute their NAV per share and have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.. There are significant capital raising constraints applicable to us under the 1940 Act when our common stock is trading below its NAV per share. In the event that we issue subscription rights to our existing stockholders to subscribe for and purchase additional shares of our common stock, there is a significant possibility that the rights offering will dilute the ownership interest and voting power of stockholders who do not fully exercise their subscription rights. Stockholders who do not fully exercise their subscription rights should expect that they will, upon completion of the rights offering, own a smaller proportional interest in us than would otherwise be the case if they fully exercised their subscription rights. In addition, because the subscription price of the rights offering is likely to be less than our most recently determined NAV per common share, our common stockholders are likely to experience an immediate dilution of the per share NAV of their shares as a result of the offer. As a result of these factors, any future rights offerings of our common stock, or our announcement of our intention to conduct a rights offering, could have a material adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock.. Common shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount from NAV.. Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount from NAV per common share. Since our inception, our common stock has at times traded above NAV per share and at times below NAV per share. During the past year, our common stock has at times traded significantly below NAV per share. Subsequent to March 31, 2018, and through May 14, 2018, our common stock has traded at discounts of up to 7.8% and premiums of up to 5.1%, of our NAV per share, which was $10.85 as of March 31, 2018. This characteristic of shares of closed-end investment companies is separate and distinct from the risk that our NAV per share will decline. As with any stock, the price of our common shares will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. If common shares are sold, the price received may be more or less than the original investment. Whether investors will realize gains or losses upon the sale of our shares will not depend directly upon our NAV, but will depend upon the market price of the shares at the time of sale. Since the market price of our common shares will be affected by such factors as the relative demand for and supply of the shares in the market, general market and economic conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict whether the common shares will trade at, below or above our NAV per share.. 34. Table of Contents. Under the 1940 Act, we are generally not able to issue additional shares of our common stock at a price below NAV per share to purchasers other than our existing common stockholders through a rights offering without first obtaining the approval of our stockholders and our independent directors. Additionally, at times when our common stock is trading below its NAV per share, our dividend yield may exceed the weighted average returns that we would expect to realize on new investments that would be made with the proceeds from the sale of such stock, making it unlikely that we would determine to issue additional common shares in such circumstances. Thus, for as long as our common stock may trade below NAV per share, we generally will be subject to significant constraints on our ability to raise capital through the issuance of common stock. Additionally, an extended period of time in which we are unable to raise capital may restrict our ability to grow and adversely impact our ability to increase or maintain our distributions.. Common stockholders may incur dilution if we sell shares of our common stock in one or more offerings at prices below the then current NAV per share.. At our most recent annual meeting of stockholders on August 24, 2017, our stockholders approved a proposal designed to allow us to sell shares of our common stock below the then current NAV per share in one or more offerings for a period of one year from the date of such approval, subject to certain conditions (including, but not limited to, that the number of common shares issued and sold pursuant to such authority does not exceed 25% of our then outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such sale).. Subject to a previous approval from our stockholders, we exercised this right with Board of Director approval in March 2018 for certain sales under the at-the-market program (Refer to \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  -  Overview  -  Recent Developments  -  At-the-Market Program\" for a discussion of our at-the-market program.), and in May 2017, when we completed a public offering of 2.1 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $9.38 per share, which was below our then current NAV of $9.95 per share. In June 2017, the underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment option and purchased an additional 155,265 shares at the public offering price of $9.38 per share and on the same terms and conditions solely to cover over-allotments. The net dilutive effect of the issuance of common stock from the May and June 2017 offerings, net of discounts, commissions, and offering costs borne by us, below NAV was $0.07 per share of common stock.. Also subject to a previous approval from our stockholders, we exercised this right with Board of Director approval in March 2015, when we completed a public offering of 3.3 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $7.40 per share, which was below our then current NAV of $8.55 per share. In April 2015, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 495,000 shares at the public offering price of $7.40 per share and on the same terms and conditions solely to cover over-allotments. The net dilutive effect of the issuance of common stock, net of discounts, commissions, and offering costs borne by us, below NAV was $0.29 per share of common stock.. Additionally and subject to a previous approval from our stockholders, we also exercised this right with our Board of Director's approval in October 2012, when we completed a public offering of 4.4 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $7.50 per share, which was below our then current NAV of $9.10 per share. The net dilutive effect of the issuance of common stock, net of discounts, commissions, and offering costs borne by us, below NAV was $0.39 per share of common stock.. At the upcoming annual stockholders meeting scheduled for August 2, 2018, we expect that our stockholders will again be asked to vote in favor of renewing this proposal for another year. During the past year, our common stock has frequently traded, and at times significantly, below NAV per share. Any decision to sell shares of our common stock below the then current NAV per share of our common stock would be subject to the determination by our Board of Directors that such issuance is in our and our stockholders' best interests.. If we were to sell shares of our common stock below NAV per share, such sales would result in an immediate dilution to the NAV per share. This dilution would occur as a result of the sale of shares at a price below the then current NAV per share of our common stock and a proportionately greater decrease in a common stockholder's interest in our earnings and assets and voting interest in us than the increase in our assets resulting from such issuance. The greater the difference between the sale price and the NAV per share at the time of the offering, the more significant the dilutive impact would be. Because the number of shares of common stock that could be so issued and the timing of any issuance is not currently known, the actual dilutive effect, if any, cannot be currently predicted. However, if, for example, we sold an additional 10% of our common stock at a 5% discount from NAV, an existing common stockholder who did not participate in that offering for its proportionate interest would suffer NAV dilution of up to 0.5% or $5 per $1,000 of NAV.. 35. Table of Contents. If we fail to pay dividends on our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock for two years, the holders of our preferred stock will be entitled to elect a majority of our directors.. The terms of our three series of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock provide for annual dividends of $1.6875, $1.6250 and $1.5625 per outstanding share of our Series B Term Preferred Stock, Series C Term Preferred Stock and Series D Term Preferred Stock, respectively. In accordance with the terms of each of our three series of mandatorily redeemable term preferred stock, if dividends thereon are unpaid in an amount equal to at least two years of dividends, the holders of such series of stock will be entitled to elect a majority of our Board of Directors.. Holders of our debt or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock have liquidation and other rights that are senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock. Any future issuance of debt or additional shares of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.. We may in the future raise additional capital through the issuance of debt or additional shares of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock (so long as such stock is issued in parity with our outstanding shares of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock in accordance with Section 18(c) of the 1940 Act) from time to time without any action on the part of the stockholders, as it has done with respect to our outstanding series of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. Our Board of Directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights and preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or upon our dissolution, winding-up or liquidation, and other terms. Holders of our outstanding mandatorily redeemable preferred stock have, and holders of any future debt securities will have, preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up. This will reduce the amount of our assets, if any, available for distribution to holders of our common stock. The decision to issue debt or preferred stock is dependent on market conditions and other factors that may be beyond our control. As a result, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future issuances. Any such future issuance could reduce the market price of our common stock.. Additionally, if we issue additional preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.. An active trading market for the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock may not exist or continue, which could adversely affect the market price of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock or a holder's ability to sell its shares.. Our Series B Term Preferred Stock, Series C Term Preferred Stock and Series D Term Preferred Stock are listed on Nasdaq. However, we cannot provide any assurances that an active trading market for the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock will exist in the future or that stockholders will be able to sell their shares of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. Even if an active trading market does exist, shares of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock may trade at a discount from the liquidation preference for such shares depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, general economic conditions, our issuance of debt or preferred equity securities and our financial condition, results of operation and prospects. To the extent an active trading market does not exist, the liquidity and trading price for shares of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock may be harmed. Accordingly, holders may be required to bear the financial risk of an investment in the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock for an indefinite period of time.. An investment in preferred stock with a fixed interest rate bears interest rate risk.. Our series of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock pays dividends at a fixed dividend rate. Prices of fixed income investments vary inversely with changes in market yields. The market yields on securities comparable to our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock may increase, which would likely result in a decline in the secondary market price of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock prior to the mandatory redemption date for that series of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.. The mandatorily redeemable preferred stock is not rated.. Our series of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock are not rated by any rating agency. Unrated securities usually trade at a discount to similar, rated securities. As a result, our series of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock may trade at a price that is lower than it might otherwise trade if rated by a rating agency.. Our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock bears a risk of early redemption by us.. We may voluntarily redeem some or all of the Series B Term Preferred Stock at any time, the Series C Term Preferred Stock on or after May 31, 2018, and the Series D Term Preferred Stock on or after September 30, 2018. We also may be forced to redeem some or all of. 36. Table of Contents. the outstanding shares of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to meet regulatory requirements or the asset coverage requirements of such shares. We are also required to redeem all of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock upon certain change of control transactions. Any such redemption may occur at a time that is unfavorable to holders of the affected series of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. We may have an incentive to redeem a series of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock voluntarily before the mandatory redemption date for such series if market conditions allow us to issue other preferred stock or debt securities at a rate that is lower than the dividend rate on such series of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock or for other reasons. If we redeem shares of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock before the mandatory redemption date for such series of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, the holders of such redeemed shares face the risk that the return on an investment purchased with proceeds from such redemption may be lower than the return previously obtained from the investment in the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.. Claims of holders of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock will be subject to a risk of subordination relative to holders of our debt instruments.. While holders of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock will have equal liquidation rights to the holder of any other outstanding series of our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, such holders will be subordinated to the rights of holders of our current and any future indebtedness, including the Credit Facility. Even though the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock is classified as a liability for purposes of GAAP and considered senior securities under the 1940 Act, the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock are not debt instruments. Therefore, dividends, distributions and other payments to holders of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock in liquidation or otherwise may be subject to prior payments due to the holders of our indebtedness. In addition, under some circumstances the 1940 Act may provide debt holders with voting rights that are superior to the voting rights of holders of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.. Holders of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock will bear dividend risk.. We may be unable to pay dividends on the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock under some circumstances. The terms of our indebtedness, including the Credit Facility, preclude the payment of dividends in respect of equity securities, including the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, under certain conditions.. There is a risk of delay in our redemption of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock, and we may fail to redeem such securities as required by their terms.. We generally make investments in private companies whose securities are not traded in any public market. Substantially all of the investments we presently hold and the investments we expect to acquire in the future are, and will be, subject to legal and other restrictions on resale and will otherwise be less liquid than publicly traded securities. The illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to obtain cash equal to the value at which we record our investments quickly if a need arises. If we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity prior to the mandatory redemption date or any other date on which we are required by law or the terms of a series of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to redeem shares of such series, we may be forced to engage in a partial redemption or to delay a required redemption. If such a partial redemption or delay were to occur, the market price of the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock might be adversely affected.. Other Risks. Cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents may adversely affect our business by causing a disruption to our operations, or the operations of businesses in which we invest, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information and/or damage to our business relationships, all of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.. A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information resources. These incidents may be an intentional attack or an unintentional event and could involve gaining unauthorized access to our information systems for purposes of misappropriating assets, stealing confidential information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. The result of these incidents may include disrupted operations, misstated or unreliable financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs, litigation and damage to our business relationships. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our information systems, both internal and those provided to us by third-party service providers. We have implemented processes, procedures and internal controls to help mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber intrusions, but these measures, as well as our increased awareness of the nature and extent of a risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that a cyber incident will not occur and/or that our financial results, operations or confidential information will not be negatively impacted by such an incident.. 37. Table of Contents. We are dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends.. Our business is dependent on our and third parties' communications and information systems. Any failure or interruption of those systems, including as a result of the termination of an agreement with any third-party service providers, could cause delays or other problems in our activities. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control and adversely affect our business. There could be:. <U+0095>   sudden electrical or telecommunications outages;. <U+0095>   natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes;. <U+0095>   disease pandemics;. <U+0095>   events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and. <U+0095>   cyber attacks.. These events, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders."
