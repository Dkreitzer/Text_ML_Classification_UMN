[1] "ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS. The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward - looking statements contained in this Annual Report. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our operating results, our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward - looking statements are made in this Annual Report.. Risks Related to our Business and Industry. We face intense competition in the denim, footwear and premium lifestyle apparel industries. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.. We face a variety of competitive challenges from other domestic and foreign fashion - oriented apparel producers, some of whom may be significantly larger and more diversified and have greater financial and marketing resources than we have. We do not currently hold a dominant competitive position in any market. We compete primarily on the basis of:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tanticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a timely manner,. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmaintaining favorable brand recognition,. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdeveloping innovative, high - quality products in sizes, colors and styles that appeal to consumers,. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tappropriately pricing products,. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproviding strong and effective marketing support,. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcreating an acceptable value proposition for retail customers,. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain efficiencies with manufacturers and retailers, and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtaining sufficient retail floor space and effective presentation of our products at retail.. Furthermore, some of our competitors are larger and may have resources available to them that we do not have or are privately held without the restraint of a public company and with limited reporting of their results of operations. Therefore, it may be difficult for us to effectively gauge consumer response to our products and how our products are competing with these and other competitors in the marketplace. Our brands also compete against brands sold by e-commerce companies, which are able to quickly adapt to consumer demands and are generally subject to lower operating costs than traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. We cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully. 18. Table of Contents. against current and future competitors, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.. Our business depends on a strong brand image, and if we are not able to maintain or enhance our brand, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition, we may be unable to sell sufficient quantities of our merchandise, which would harm our business and cause our results of operations to suffer.. Maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to maintaining and expanding our customer base, and requires us to make substantial investments in areas such as visual merchandising, marketing and advertising, employee training and store operations. We anticipate that, as our business expands into new markets and new product classifications and further penetrates existing markets, and as the markets in which we operate become increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brands may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Certain of our competitors in the apparel industry have faced adverse publicity surrounding the quality, attributes and performance of their products. Our brand may similarly be adversely affected if our public image or reputation is tarnished by failing to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity. Any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to be a leader in the contemporary apparel industry and to continue to provide high quality products. If we are unable to maintain or enhance our brand image, our results of operations may suffer and our business may be harmed.. We have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial performance and impact our ability to service our indebtedness. In addition, we may require additional capital to finance our growth strategy, and our inability to raise such capital on commercially acceptable terms or at all could limit our growth.. After giving effect to the RG Merger and related Merger Transactions, the acquisition of SWIMS, and the incurrence of indebtedness in connection therewith, we have approximately $96.5 million in indebtedness, including $68.6 million of indebtedness under the New Credit Agreements and $27.6 million of indebtedness under the Modified Convertible Notes and SWIMS Convertible Note. In January 2018, the outstanding balance of the SWIMS Convertible Note of $13.8 million, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, converted into 4,587,964 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock. If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt obligations, will increase. The degree to which we, together with our subsidiaries, are leveraged or incur additional debt could have important consequences to our ability to meet debt obligations. For example, the degree of our consolidated leverage:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmay limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or general corporate purposes, particularly if, as discussed further in the following risk factors, (1) the ratings assigned to our debt securities by nationally recognized credit rating organizations are revised downward or (2) we seek capital during periods of turbulent or unsettled market conditions;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmay require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal on our debt, reducing the funds available to us for other purposes, including acquisitions, capital expenditures, marketing and other growth initiatives;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmay increase our future borrowing costs;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmay limit our flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions as compared to our competitors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmay put us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that are not as leveraged;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmay increase the risk that third parties will be unwilling or unable to engage in hedging or other financial or commercial arrangements with us;. 19. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmay increase the risk that we will need to sell securities or assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, or take other unfavorable actions to meet payment obligations; or. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmay increase the risk that we will not meet the financial covenants contained in our current or future debt agreements or timely make all required debt payments.. Our ability to make cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate significant operating cash flow in the future. This ability is, to a significant extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that will be beyond our control.. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. In any such circumstance, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments. Any such action, if necessary, may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The instruments governing our indebtedness may restrict our ability to sell assets and our use of the proceeds from such sales.. In addition, we may, in the future, require additional capital to help fund our growth strategy, including potential acquisitions and investments. If we do not have sufficient cash to finance those additional capital needs at the time required, we will need to raise additional funds through equity and/or debt financing. When such additional financing is needed, we cannot guarantee that such financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or at all. In addition, our ability to obtain additional financing is limited by the terms of the agreements governing our secured indebtedness and in some cases requires the consent of our lenders. For a description of certain limitations related to the operation of our business contained in such agreements, see the immediately following risk factor. If additional capital is needed and is either unavailable or cost-prohibitive, our growth may be limited as we may need to alter our business strategy and/or forgo consummating such acquisitions or making such investments, or divest one or more of our existing brands. In addition, any additional funding may restrict our operating flexibility by imposing additional covenants upon us. Furthermore, the issuance of additional equity securities may dilute the ownership or voting rights of our existing stockholders, or the new securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock.. The agreements governing our secured indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that may limit our operational flexibility. Furthermore, if we default on our obligations under such agreements, our operations may be interrupted and our business and financial results could be adversely affected.. The agreements governing our secured indebtedness restrict our ability to, among other things: incur indebtedness; create liens; consolidate, merge, liquidate or dissolve; sell, lease or otherwise transfer any assets; substantially change the nature of the business; make investments or acquisitions; pay dividends; enter into transactions with affiliates; amend material documents, prepay indebtedness and make capital expenditures. Such agreements also require us to comply with various financial maintenance covenants to be tested monthly and quarterly depending on the definitions. In addition, substantially all of our assets, including our trademarks, secure our obligations under such agreements. For more information, see \"Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Agreements and Other Financing Arrangements.\". The restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing our secured indebtedness and the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our shareholders, including, but not limited to, potentially:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmaking us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and changes in our business;. 20. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreasing borrowing costs and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate requirements;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequiring the dedication of a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non - strategic divestitures; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmaking it more difficult for us to repay, refinance, or satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt.. In addition, any failure by us to comply with the various covenants could have material adverse consequences. Such noncompliance may result in our inability to borrow under such agreements, which we utilize to access our working capital, and as a result may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations or pursue any expansion plans. An event of default under such agreements could also result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. If the financing under our material indebtedness becomes due and payable, we may be required to refinance, restructure, or otherwise amend some or all of such obligations, sell assets, or raise additional cash through the sale of our equity. We cannot make any assurances that we would be able to obtain such refinancing in a timely manner, on favorable terms or at all, or that such restructuring activities, sales of assets, or issuances of equity can be accomplished or, if accomplished, would raise sufficient funds to meet these obligations. Additionally, upon the occurrence of an \"event of default\" under such agreements, all of our assets could be subject to liquidation by the creditors, which liquidation could result in no assets being left for our stockholders until the creditors receive their required payment.. Our success will further depend on implementing a shift in Hudson's denim production from primarily domestic production to foreign production and customer reception to Hudson producing non - United States denim products.. The Hudson® brand has historically produced substantially all of its denim apparel in Los Angeles, California. Our ability to improve operational efficiencies and profitability will depend in part upon the successful implementation of shifting all or substantially all of Hudson's® denim production to Asia, Mexico, Turkey and other foreign countries to achieve better production costs and margin improvement. There are risks and uncertainties when undertaking large - scale changes in denim production and sourcing, particularly in a foreign country. In addition, Hudson® has a loyal customer following of its U.S. produced denim products.  There can be no assurances that such a large - scale move of production will not affect the fit, quality or construction or timely deliveries to retailers of our Hudson® branded denim or that we may experience negative reaction from the Hudson® customer base and negative reception for denim not produced in the United States.. Problems with sourcing, along with the extent of our foreign sourcing, may adversely affect our business.. We primarily source our products from independent manufacturing contractors, which create, sell or procure our products for us. A manufacturing contractor's failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet the required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items. The failure to make timely deliveries may cause customers to cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.. Additionally, as a result of the magnitude of our foreign sourcing, our business is subject to certain risks, including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical and economic instability in countries or regions, including heightened terrorism and other security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional or more frequent inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlabor union strikes at ports through which our products enter the United States;. 21. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlabor shortages in countries where contractors and suppliers are located;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta significant decrease in availability or an increase in the cost of raw materials;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in tariffs, quotas, duties, taxes, charges on imports, fund transfers and other regulations imposed by foreign countries or by the United States;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisease epidemics and health - related concerns, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials, and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe migration and development of manufacturing contractors, which could affect where our products are or planned to be produced;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreases in the costs of fuel, travel and transportation;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduced manufacturing flexibility because of geographic distance between our foreign manufacturers and us, increasing the risk that we may have to mark down unsold inventory as a result of misjudging the market for a foreign made product; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tviolations by foreign contractors of labor and wage standards and resulting adverse publicity.. If these risks limit or prevent us from manufacturing products in any significant international market, prevent us from acquiring products from foreign suppliers, or significantly increase the cost of our products, our operations could be seriously disrupted until alternative suppliers are found or alternative markets are developed, which could negatively impact our business.. We do not have written agreements with any of our third - party manufacturing contractors. As a result, any single manufacturing contractor could unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time. Supply disruptions from any of our third - party manufacturing contractors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demands, if we are unable to source suitable replacement materials in a timely manner, at acceptable prices or at all. Our inability to promptly replace manufacturing contractors that terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide high quality products in a timely and cost - efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.. Potential changes in international trade relations implemented by the U.S presidential administration could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows and operating results.. Our products are primarily produced by, and purchased or procured from, independent manufacturing contractors, many of whom are located outside of the United States, such as Mexico, Italy, Peru, and Asia, including Hong Kong, China, India, Jordan, and Vietnam.  For fiscal 2017, approximately 67 percent of total purchases for our brands was attributable to manufacturing contractors located outside of the United States, with approximately 25 percent of purchases attributable to manufacturing contractors located in Mexico and approximately 39 percent of purchases attributable to manufacturing contractors located in Asia, including India.. Due to these high levels of foreign sourcing, our import operations are subject to international trade regulations, including import charges, and free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\") and other bilateral textile agreements among the United States and its trading partners, including China. U.S. President Donald J. Trump, certain members of Congress and other U.S. officials have indicated that they may advocate and/or enact key policy shifts in diplomatic and commercial relations among the United States and other countries where our manufacturing contractors are found. These include the renegotiation of proposed and existing trade agreements like NAFTA, the implementation of border taxes or other measures affecting the level of U.S.-Mexican trade, a reduction in trade with China, the raising of tariffs on Chinese imports and a reversal of the long-standing position that Taiwan is part of \"one China.\". 22. Table of Contents. It remains unclear what President Trump's administration may do with respect to these trade agreements and other restrictive measures, and we cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, or other similar restrictions will be imposed by the United States or other countries upon the import or export of our products in the future. President Trump has recently announced plans to impose tariffs on certain imports, and it is unclear what effects such tariffs (including any retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. exports) would have on retail markets. If the United States were to withdraw from or materially modify NAFTA, or other international trade agreements to which it is a party, or if tariffs or other import charges were raised on foreign-sourced goods that we sell, it could substantially affect our ability to source goods at commercially attractive prices, thus having a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Increased restrictions on fund transfers to or from foreign countries and quotas imposed by bilateral textile agreements between the United States and foreign countries could also hurt the economic viability of our foreign sourcing or cause our foreign counterparties to terminate their relationships with us, thus increasing our cost of goods sold or exposing us to additional capital expenses if we must find replacement manufacturing contractors or repatriate certain production to the United States.  Changes in regulatory or geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect our business in the future or may require us to modify our current business practices.. Problems with the third party distribution system could harm our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve targeted operating efficiencies.. The Hudson®, Robert Graham®, and SWIMS® brands rely on distribution facilities operated by third parties. Our ability to meet the needs of our wholesale partners and our own retail stores depends on the proper operation of these distribution facilities. These third parties will continue to provide distribution services until we elect to terminate such services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into other contracts for alternate or replacement distribution centers on acceptable terms or at all. Such an event could disrupt our operations. In addition, because substantially all of our products are distributed from a limited number of locations, our operations could also be interrupted by labor difficulties, or by floods, fires, earthquakes or other natural disasters near such facilities. We maintain business interruption insurance; however, this coverage may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions to our distribution system. If we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve targeted operating efficiencies could be harmed. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.. We face risks associated with constantly changing fashion trends, including consumer response to and demand for our products. If we are unable to adapt to changing fashion trends as to our existing or new products, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.. Our success depends on our ability to anticipate, gauge and respond to changing consumer demand and fashion trends in a timely manner, both as to existing products and as to other product classifications we may initiate. Any failure on our part to anticipate, identify and respond effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion trends could adversely affect the acceptance of our existing or new products and leave us with a substantial amount of unsold inventory or missed opportunities in the marketplace. If that occurs, we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow - moving inventory, which may negatively affect our ability to achieve profitability. At the same time, a focus on tight management of inventory may result, from time to time, in our not having an adequate supply of products to meet consumer demand and may cause us to lose sales.. 23. Table of Contents. We attempt to minimize our risk associated with delivering items through early order commitments by retailers. We generally place production orders with manufacturers before we have received all of a season's orders and orders may be cancelled by retailers before shipment. Therefore, if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to consumer preferences, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.. We are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space, are generally subject to long - term non - cancelable leases and are required to make substantial lease payments under our operating leases, and any failure to make these lease payments when due would likely harm our business, profitability and results of operations.. We do not own any of our retail stores, but instead lease all of our retail stores under retail store leases and are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing real estate. Our leases generally have terms of 10 years with an option to renew. The leases are generally terminable after three to five years, and all leases have restrictions in connection with assigning or subletting them. All of our leases require a fixed annual rent, and most require the payment of additional \"percentage\" rent if store sales exceed a negotiated amount. Most of the retail store leases are \"net\" leases, which require us to pay all of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. Additionally, certain of the leases may allow the lessor to terminate the lease or not renew if we do not achieve a specified gross sales threshold in a particular year. We cannot assure you that we will achieve any of these thresholds. Any loss of our store locations due to underperformance may harm our results of operations, stock price and reputation.. Additional sites that we lease are likely to be subject to similar long - term leases. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term if we cannot negotiate a mutually acceptable termination payment. In addition, as our leases expire, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations. If we are unable to enter into new leases or renew existing leases on terms acceptable to us or be released from our obligations under leases for stores that we close, our business, profitability and results of operations may be harmed.. Our ability to attract customers to our stores depends heavily on successfully placing our stores in suitable locations and any impairment of a store location, including any decrease in customer traffic, could cause our sales to be less than expected.. Our approach to identifying locations for our retail stores typically favors street and mall locations near premium and contemporary retailers that we believe are consistent with our key customers' demographics and shopping preferences. Sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the volume of foot traffic in these locations. Changes in areas around our existing retail locations that result in reductions in customer foot traffic or otherwise render the locations unsuitable could cause our sales to be less than expected and the related leases are generally non - cancelable. Store locations may become unsuitable due to, and our sales volume and customer traffic generally may be harmed by, among other things:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teconomic downturns in a particular area;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompetition from nearby retailers selling similar apparel;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanging consumer demographics in a particular market;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanging preferences of consumers in a particular market;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe closing or decline in popularity of other businesses located near our store; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstore impairments due to acts of God, natural disasters, climate change or terrorism.. 24. Table of Contents. Our ability to successfully open and operate new retail stores depends on many factors, including, among others, our ability to:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tidentify new markets where our products and brand image will be accepted or the performance of our retail stores will be successful;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtain desired locations, including store size and adjacencies, in targeted malls or streets;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnegotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired rent and tenant improvement allowances, to secure suitable store locations;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tachieve brand awareness, affinity and purchase intent in the new markets;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thire, train and retain store associates and field management;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tassimilate new store associates and field management into our corporate culture;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsource and supply sufficient inventory levels; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuccessfully integrate new retail stores into our existing operations and information technology systems.. As of April 2, 2018, we had 30 Robert Graham® brand stores, which consisted of 18 full price stores and 12 outlet stores, and two SWIMS® brand outlet stores. Lack of availability, of desired store locations, delays in the acquisition or opening of new stores, delays or costs resulting from a decrease in commercial development due to capital restraints, difficulties in staffing and operating new store locations or a lack of customer acceptance of stores in new market areas may negatively impact our new store growth and the costs or the profitability associated with new stores. There can be no assurance that we will open new stores in fiscal 2018 or thereafter. Any failure to successfully open and operate new stores may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.. We may be unable to grow comparable store sales or average sales per square foot in our retail stores, which could cause our share price to decline.. We may not be able to grow our comparable store sales or average sales per square foot in our retail stores. If our future comparable store sales or average sales per square foot decline or fail to meet market expectations, the price of our common stock could decline. In addition, the aggregate results of operations through our wholesale partners and at our retail locations have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. The continued operation of our retail locations depends on our ability to hire, train and retain associates and field management. A variety of factors affect both comparable store sales and average sales per square foot, including, among others, consumer spending patterns, fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our product assortment, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions. If we misjudge the market for our products, we may incur excess inventory for some of our products and miss opportunities for other products. These factors may cause our comparable store sales results and average sales per square foot in the future to be materially lower than recent periods or our expectations, which could harm our results of operations and result in a decline in the price of our common stock.. Uncertain economic conditions in the United States and other parts of the world can affect consumer confidence and consumer spending patterns and our business could be negatively impacted by the financial health of our retail customers.. The economy in the United States and abroad continues to be in the midst of uncertainty. The apparel industry has historically been subject to cyclical variations, recessions in the general economy or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits which could negatively impact our business overall, the carrying value of our tangible and intangible assets, sales, gross margins and profitability.. 25. Table of Contents. Our business depends on the general economic environment and levels of consumer spending that affect not only the ultimate consumer, but also retailers, our largest direct customers. Purchases of high - fashion apparel and accessories tend to decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, when consumer spending, particularly on discretionary items, and disposable income decline. Many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel industry, including, among others: prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, energy costs, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. During periods of recession or economic uncertainty, we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales to existing customers, make sales to new customers, open and operate new retail stores, or maintain or improve our earnings from operations as a percentage of net sales.. In addition, we sell our products primarily to retail and distribution companies in the U.S., Canada and Europe based on pre - qualified payment terms. Financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail business with that customer. We may also assume more credit risk relating to that customer's receivables. We are dependent primarily on lines of credit that we establish from time to time with customers, and should a substantial number of customers become unable to pay to us their respective debts as they become due, we may be unable to collect some or all of the monies owed by those customers. In particular, because of the concentration of our customer and customer groups, our results of operations could be adversely affected if any one of these customers fails to satisfy its payment obligations to us when due.. In recent years, the retail industry has experienced consolidation, restructurings, reorganizations and other ownership changes that have resulted in one entity controlling several different stores or the elimination of stores. This consolidation can result in fewer customers for our products or the closing of some stores or the number of \"doors\" which carry our products. As a result, the potential for consolidation or ownership changes, closing of retail outlets and fewer customers could negatively impact sales of our products and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. Economic conditions have also led to a highly promotional environment and strong discounting pressure from both our wholesale partners and retail customers, which could lead to a negative impact on our revenues and profitability. This promotional environment may continue even after economic growth returns, as we expect consumer spending trends are expected to remain at historically depressed levels for the foreseeable future. The domestic and international political situation also affects consumer confidence. The threat, outbreak or escalation of terrorism, military conflicts, civil unrest or other hostilities around the world could lead to further decreases in consumer spending.. A substantial portion of our net sales and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers, and the loss of any of these large customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. Our business is substantially dependent on its 10 largest customers and customer groups, which accounted for approximately 46 percent and  48 percent of net sales during fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. The largest customer for our business, Nordstrom, Inc., accounted for 15 percent and 18 percent of our net sales in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. We do not enter into any type of long - term agreements or firm commitment orders with any of our customers. Instead, we enter into a number of individual purchase order commitments with our customers. Although we reasonably believe that we would be able to find alternative customers or increase sales to our existing customer base to purchase our products in the event of the loss of any of these existing customers, the loss of a customer could have a material adverse effect on our business. A decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, including our limited number of private label customers, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease the amount of merchandise purchased from us, to change their manner of doing business with us, to cancel orders previously placed in advance of shipment dates or a decision to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. 26. Table of Contents. Our plans to improve and expand our product offerings may not be successful, and the implementation of these plans may divert our operational, managerial and administrative resources, which could harm our competitive position and reduce our net revenue and profitability.. We plan to grow our business by increasing our core product offerings, which includes expanding our Hudson® brand, Robert Graham® brand, and SWIMS® brand product collection, including into new product classifications. We will continue to evaluate our plan to develop and introduce select new product categories and pursue select additional licensing opportunities in other categories.. If our expected product offerings fail to maintain and enhance our brand identity, our image may be diminished or diluted. The expansion into new products and classifications may require the establishment of new sourcing relationships, increasing our sourcing risk. See \"Risk Factors - Problems with sourcing, along with the extent of our foreign sourcing, may adversely affect our business.\" As we expand our licensing activities, we increase risks associated with having a limited ability to conduct comprehensive final quality checks on merchandise, which could affect product quality.. In addition, our ability to successfully carry out our plans to improve and expand our product offerings may be affected by economic and competitive conditions, changes in consumer spending patterns and changes in consumer preferences and style trends. These plans could be abandoned, could cost more than anticipated and could divert resources from other areas of our business, any of which could impact our competitive position and reduce our net sales and profitability.. Our licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties who may not comply with our product quality, manufacturing standards, marketing and other requirements, which may have an adverse effect on our brand equity, reputation or business.. We license our Hudson® brand to third parties for manufacturing, marketing and distribution of children's products. Additionally, on June 8, 2017, Hudson entered into a licensing agreement for the production and distribution of Hudson® product in the European Union and Switzerland. We  also license trademarks associated with our Robert Graham® brand to third parties for manufacturing, marketing and distribution of apparel and accessories. We believe that licensing our brands for certain product categories and in certain geographic areas will broaden and enhance the products available under these brand names.. Our licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited control. We have also entered into certain license agreements for our Robert Graham® brand in the following categories: men's dress shirts, neckwear, tailored clothing, hosiery, leather goods (including bags and belts and small leathers), sun and optical eyewear, headwear, jewelry, footwear, underwear and loungewear and fragrances. In the future, we may enter into select additional licensing arrangements for product offerings which require specialized expertise. We may also enter into select licensing agreements pursuant to which we may grant third parties the right to distribute and sell our products in certain additional geographic areas.. Although we have taken and will continue to take steps to select potential licensing partners carefully and to monitor the activities of our licensing partners (through, among other things, approval rights over product design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, marketing, distribution and advertising), such arrangements may not be successful. Our licensing partners may fail to fulfill their obligations under their license agreements or have interests that differ from or conflict with our own, such as the pricing of our products and the offering of competitive products. In addition, the risks applicable to the business of our licensing partners may be different than the risks applicable to our business, including risks associated with each such partner's ability to:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtain capital;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texercise operational and financial control over its business;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmanage its labor relations;. 27. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmaintain relationships with suppliers;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmanage its credit and bankruptcy risks; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmaintain customer relationships.. Any of the foregoing risks, or the inability of any of our licensing partners to successfully market our products or otherwise conduct the licensing partners' business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations and reputation in regions or product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements.. If we are unable to accurately forecast customer demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to deliver products to meet our requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of products to our stores and to wholesale customers.. We stock our stores, and provide inventory to our wholesale customers, based on our wholesale customers' estimates of future demand for particular products. Our inventory management and production planning teams determine the number of pieces of each product that we will order from our manufacturers based upon past sales of similar products, sales trend information and anticipated demand at our suggested retail prices. However, if our inventory and planning team fails to accurately forecast customer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage our inventory or production at a level appropriate for future customer demand.. Factors that could affect our inventory management and production planning teams' ability to accurately forecast customer demand for our products include:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta substantial increase or decrease in demand for our products or for products of our competitors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance for our new products;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnew product introductions or pricing strategies by competitors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmore limited historical store sales information for our newer products and markets;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tweakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in the future; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacts or threats of war or terrorism or civil unrest which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or our international sales.. If we were to experience rapid growth, we may place insufficient levels of desirable product with our wholesale customers and in our retail locations such that we would be unable to fully satisfy customer demand at those locations. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to match supply with demand in all cases in the future, whether as a result of our inability to produce sufficient levels of desirable product or our failure to forecast demand accurately. As a result of these inabilities or failures, we may encounter difficulties in filling customer orders or in liquidating excess inventory at discount prices and may experience significant write - offs. Additionally, if we over - produce a product based on an aggressive forecast of demand, retailers may not be able to sell the product and cancel future orders or require returns or markdown allowances. These outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and adversely impact sales, gross margins and profitability.. If we are unable to manage our operations at our current size or are unable to manage any future growth effectively, our business results and financial performance may suffer.. We have made and are making investments to support our near and longer - term growth. If our operations continue to grow over the longer term, of which there can be no assurance, we will be required to expand our sales and. 28. Table of Contents. marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems and other processes, and to obtain more space for our expanding administrative support and other headquarters personnel. The integration of our Hudson Business, our Robert Graham Business, and our SWIMS Business could strain our existing resources. As a result, we could experience operating difficulties, including obtaining sufficient raw materials at acceptable prices, securing manufacturing capacity to produce our products and experiencing delays in production and shipments. These difficulties would likely lead to a decrease in net revenue, income from operations and the price of our common stock, and such decreases could be significant.. Our business could suffer as a result of a manufacturer's inability to produce our goods on time and to our specifications or if we need to replace manufacturers.. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent third parties for the manufacture of all of our products. We enter into a number of purchase order commitments each season specifying a time for delivery, method of payment, design and quality specifications and other standard industry provisions, but do not have long - term contracts with any manufacturer. None of the manufacturers we use produces our products exclusively. The inability of a certain manufacturer to ship orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet our quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items, which could result in cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries or a reduction in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Because of the seasonality of our business, and the apparel and fashion business in particular, the dates on which customers need and require shipments of products from us are critical, as styles and consumer tastes change rapidly in the apparel and fashion business. Further, because quality is a leading factor when customers and retailers accept or reject goods, any decline in quality by our third - party manufacturers could be detrimental not only to a particular order, but also to our future relationship with that particular customer.. We compete with other companies for the production capacity of our manufacturers. Some of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, and thus may have an advantage in the competition for production and import quota capacity. If we experience a significant increase in demand, or if an existing manufacturer of ours must be replaced, we may have to expand our third - party manufacturing capacity. We cannot provide assurance that this additional capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or similar to any existing terms which we have with our manufacturers, either from a production standpoint or a financial standpoint.. If an independent manufacturer of ours fails to use acceptable labor practices, our business could suffer.. While we require our independent manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we have no control over the ultimate actions of our independent manufacturers. Despite our lack of control, we have internal and vendor operating guidelines to promote ethical business practices and our staff periodically visits and monitors the operations of our independent manufacturers. We also use the services of a third party independent labor consulting service to conduct on site audits where required by state labor laws to help minimize our risk and exposure to unacceptable labor practice violations. The violation of labor or other laws by one of our independent manufacturers or the divergence of an independent manufacturer's labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. Any of these, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In particular, the laws governing garment manufacturers in the State of California impose joint liability upon us and our independent manufacturers for the labor practices of those independent manufacturers. As a result, should one of our independent manufacturers be found in violation of California labor laws, we could suffer adverse financial or other unforeseen adverse consequences.. Increases in the price of raw materials or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and decrease our profitability.. The principal fabrics used in our business are cotton, blends, synthetics and wools. The prices we pay our suppliers for our products are dependent in part on the market price for the raw materials - primarily cotton - used to produce them. The price and availability of cotton may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors,. 29. Table of Contents. including demand, crop yields, weather, supply conditions, transportation costs, work stoppages, government regulation, economic climates and other unpredictable factors. Increases in raw material costs, together with other factors, could result in a decrease of our profitability unless we are able to pass higher prices on to our customers. Moreover, any decrease in the availability of cotton could impair our ability to meet our production requirements in a timely manner, which could adversely affects our revenues and working capital requirements.. We are dependent on our relationships with our vendors.. We purchase our raw materials, including fabric, yarns, threads and trims, such as zippers, buttons and tags from a variety of vendors. While we are not reliant exclusively on one or more particular vendor for the supply of the raw materials or component parts required to meet our manufacturing needs, we depend on our relationships and these vendors to ensure our supply of these raw materials or component parts. Any problems or disputes with these vendors could result in us having to source these raw materials or component parts from another vendor, which could delay production, and in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. Our trademark and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected and some of our products are targets of counterfeiting.. We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We may, however, experience conflict with various third parties who acquire or claim ownership rights in certain trademarks as we expand our product offerings and expand the number of countries where we sell our products. We cannot ensure that any actions taken to establish and protect these trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of their trademarks and proprietary rights. Also, we cannot assure that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.. Our products are sometimes the target of counterfeiters. As a result, there are often products that are imitations or \"knock - offs\" of our products that can be found in the marketplace or consumers can find products that are confusingly similar to ours. We intend to continue to vigorously defend our trademarks and products bearing our trademarks, however, we cannot assure you that our efforts will be adequate to prosecute and block all sales of infringing products from the marketplace.. Any potential future acquisitions, strategic investments or mergers may subject us to significant risks, any of which may harm our business and may lead to substantial dilution or negative effects on the market price of our common stock.. Our strategy includes identifying and acquiring, investing in or merging with suitable candidates on acceptable terms in order to grow or complement our business. Acquisitions would involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiversion of management attention from running our existing business;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpossible material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased expenses including legal, administrative and compensation expenses related to newly hired employees;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased costs to integrate the technology, personnel, customer base and business practices of the acquired company with us;. 30. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential exposure to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process, including cyber security risks;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential adverse effects on our reported operating results due to possible write - down of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with acquisitions;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany acquired business, technology, service or product may significantly under - perform relative to our expectations, and we may not achieve the benefits we expect from the acquisition.. For any or all of these reasons, our pursuit of an acquisition, investment or merger may cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. In addition, the success of our strategy to pursue potential future acquisitions will depend on our ability to achieve savings from the elimination of duplicative expenses or the realization of other efficiencies associated with such acquisitions. Failure to implement our strategic plan with success, including our ability to achieve anticipated savings in connection with any potential future acquisitions, could result in increased costs and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.. Because we are highly levered, we expect that we may need to issue additional equity to support our growth. However, the addition of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the market or the registration of any other securities may significantly and negatively affect the prevailing market price for our common stock and would dilute the ownership of our then existing stockholders.. The seasonal nature of our business makes management more difficult, severely reduces cash flow and liquidity during parts of the year and could force us to curtail our operations.. Our business is seasonal. The majority of our marketing and sales activities take place from late fall to early spring. The greatest volume of shipments and sales typically occurs from late spring through the early fall, which coincides with our third and fourth fiscal quarters. This requires us to build - up inventories during our first and second fiscal quarters when our cash flow is weakest. Cash flow is typically strongest in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. Unfavorable economic conditions affecting retailers during the fall and holiday seasons in any year could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the year. We are likely to experience periods of negative cash flow throughout each year, including, a drop - off in business commencing each December, which could force us to curtail operations if adequate liquidity is not available. We cannot assure you that the effects of such seasonality will diminish in the future.. Computer system disruption and cyber security threats, including a privacy or data security breach, could damage our relationships with our customers, harm our reputation, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business. We may also incur an increase in costs in an effort to minimize those risks.. We depend on technology systems and networks for a significant portion of our direct-to-consumer sales, including sales of our Hudson®, Robert Graham® and SWIMS® products via ecommerce channels, retail business credit and debit card transaction authorizations and processing at our Robert Graham® and SWIMS® stores, and repeat customer sales via our online Collector's Club Loyalty Program. Information technology systems are integral to other aspects of other business, such as corporate email communications to and from employees, customers and retail stores, the design, manufacture and distribution of our apparel products, digital marketing efforts, collection and retention of customer data and employee information, and our interaction with the public in the social media space. Given the nature of our ecommerce presence and digital strategy, it is imperative that we and our ecommerce partners maintain uninterrupted operation of our computer hardware, software systems, customer marketing databases, and email servers.. The retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks, and a security breach could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. We have confidential. 31. Table of Contents. security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks. However, we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly - evolving types of cyber - attacks. Additionally, although many of our third-party service providers use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems. Attacks may be targeted at us, our customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third - party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. In addition, data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non - technical issues, including breach by us or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.. Although we expect the U.S. federal tax reform to have a favorable impact on our overall U.S federal tax liability, the effects of the tax reform are uncertain and include limitations on interest deductions which may adversely affect our results.. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") was signed into law making significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Tax Act reduced the maximum U.S. statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective for tax years including or beginning January 1, 2018, and made other changes that could have a favorable impact on our overall U.S. federal tax liability in a given period. However, the Tax Act also included a number of provisions that limit or eliminate various deductions which could adversely affect our U.S. federal income tax position. For example, the Tax Act may, for future years, limit our ability to deduct interest expense to the extent that such expenses exceed 30% of our adjusted taxable income in a given year. We continue to examine the impact the Tax Act may have on our business, which is uncertain and may be adverse. There can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations, both within the U.S. and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. See \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  -  Note 12  -  Income Taxes\" for further discussion.. Risks Related to our Common Stock. If our common stock's closing bid price falls and subsequently remains below the minimum price of $1.00 per share, our common stock may be delisted from the The Nasdaq Capital Market maintained by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\"NASDAQ\").. As recently as February 14, 2018, the closing price of our common stock fell below $1.00 per share. If our common stock were to trade below $1.00 per share, which is the minimum closing bid price required for continued listing on NASDAQ, for 30 consecutive business days, we will receive a notification letter from NASDAQ and will have 180 calendar days (subject to extension in some circumstances) to regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule.  To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days (or such longer period of time as the NASDAQ may require in some circumstances). If we fail to regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule or fail to maintain compliance with all other applicable NASDAQ continued listing requirements, NASDAQ may determine to delist our common stock, at which time our common stock would be quoted on the OTC markets. The delisting of our common stock could adversely impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock, reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, limiting our ability to issue additional securities in the future, and limiting our ability to fund our operations.. Our common stock price is volatile and may decrease.. The market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly and investors in our common stock could lose the value of their investment. In addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent times, which could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.. 32. Table of Contents. The trading price and volume of our common stock has historically been subject to fluctuations in response to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond our control:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannual and quarterly variations in actual or anticipated operating results;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toperating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in market valuations of other premium denim apparel companies;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements of new product lines by us or our competitors, announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or dispositions of assets, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadditions or departures of key personnel or members of our board of directors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in governmental regulation applicable to us and our products; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral conditions in the apparel industry.. In the 52 week period prior to the filing of this Annual Report, the closing price of our common stock has ranged from $0.70 to $2.45. In addition, stock markets generally have experienced price and volume trading volatility in recent years. This volatility has had an effect on the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.. Ownership of our common stock is concentrated among affiliates of Tengram Capital Partners and certain other large holders, which substantially reduces the ability of other stockholders to influence management, including through the election of directors, and may result in decisions that do not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders.. As of April 2, 2018,  based upon the Amendment No. 3 to Schedule 13D dated January 18, 2018, the largest beneficial owners of our common stock - entities and individuals affiliated with TCP Denim, LLC and Tengram II (the \"Tengram Affiliates\") - beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 49.8% of our common stock and voting power. This includes, in addition to shares of common stock owned outright by various Tengram Affiliates, (i) shares of common stock issuable upon (a) conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock held by TCP Denim, LLC and (b) exercise of the SWIMS Warrant held by Tengram II and (ii) shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock which were issued upon the conversion of the SWIMS Convertible Note on January 18, 2018, which may then convert into shares of common stock. For more information, see \"Part III, Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners, Management and Related Stockholder Matters.\" The holders of the Series A and Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, on an as-converted basis, on all matters presented to the common stockholders for approval, and will, for so long as the shares of preferred stock remain outstanding, have certain rights and privileges different from our common stockholders, such as the election of up to three directors to our board of directors. Additionally, our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the \"Bylaws\") permit any action required or permitted to be taken by stockholders at a meeting to be effect by written consent, if the request is signed by record holders holding at least 20% of the voting power of our then-outstanding common stock entitled to vote on the matter.. Our largest shareholders, and particularly the Tengram Affiliates, are thus in a position to exert significant control over us and have the ability to substantially influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, an increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance under our stock option plans, and to exert significant control. 33. Table of Contents. over our management and affairs. This concentration of beneficial ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to other stockholders.. The market price of our common stock could be negatively affected by future sales of our common stock.. Sales by us or holders of a substantial percentage of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or could impair our ability to raise capital through a future sale of, or pay for acquisitions using, our equity securities. If we or our existing stockholders, particularly our largest stockholders, our directors, their affiliates, or our executive officers, sell a substantial number of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly. The perception in the public market that we or these stockholders might sell our common stock could also depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our future ability to obtain capital, especially through an offering of equity securities.. If we do not meet the expectations of equity research analysts, if they do not continue to publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.. The trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. The analysts' estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our results of operations or financial condition are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our share price could decline. Moreover, the price of our common stock could decline if one or more securities analysts downgrade our common stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or do not publish research or reports about us or our business."
