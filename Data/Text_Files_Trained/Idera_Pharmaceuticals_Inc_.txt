[1] "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.. RISK FACTORS. Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before purchasing our common stock. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these and currently unknown risks or uncertainties. In that case, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our securities.. Risks Relating to the Mergers. Completion of the proposed BioCryst merger is subject to conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the merger will not be completed.. On January 21, 2018, we announced that we had entered into the Merger Agreement with BioCryst, Holdco, Merger Sub A and Merger Sub B, pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub A will be merged with and into us, with us surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco, and (ii) Merger Sub B will be merged with and into BioCryst, with BioCryst surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco.  The consummation of the Mergers is subject to customary closing conditions, including (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote thereon, (ii) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all outstanding shares of BioCryst common stock entitled to vote thereon, (iii) the absence of any adverse law or order promulgated, entered, enforced, enacted or issued by any governmental entity that prohibits, restrains or makes illegal the consummation of the Mergers, (iv) the shares of Holdco common stock to be issued in the Mergers being approved for listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, (v) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and other material government approvals, (vi) the SEC having declared effective the Form S-4 Registration Statement of Holdco which will contain the joint proxy statement/prospectus of the parties in connection with the Mergers, (vii) subject to certain materiality exceptions, the accuracy of certain representations and warranties of us and BioCryst, respectively, contained in the Merger Agreement and the compliance by each party with the covenants contained in the Merger Agreement, (viii) the receipt of certain opinions from legal counsel regarding the intended tax treatment of the Mergers and (ix) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to us and BioCryst, respectively.. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the Mergers by a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in completing the Mergers could cause us to not realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the Mergers are successfully completed within the expected timeframe.. If we are unable to complete the proposed Mergers, we may have incurred substantial expense and diverted significant management time and resources from our ongoing business. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, we may be required to pay BioCryst a termination fee of $25 million or a fixed expense reimbursement amount of $6 million.. There can be no assurance that the conditions to closing of the Mergers will be satisfied or waived or that the Mergers will be completed.. Combining Idera and BioCryst may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the proposed Mergers may not be realized.. We are operating and, until the completion of the Mergers, will continue to operate independently of BioCryst. The success of the Mergers, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses. It is possible that the pendency of the Mergers and/or the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, higher than expected costs, diversion of management attention, the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls,. 31. Table of Contents. procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company's ability to maintain relationships with customers, vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Mergers.. We will incur transaction fees, including legal, regulatory and other costs associated with closing the transaction, as well as expenses relating to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the Mergers and the integration of the two companies' businesses. While we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses should allow us to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all. As part of the integration process, we may also attempt to divest certain assets of the combined company, which may not be possible on favorable terms, or at all, or if successful, may change the profile of the combined company. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Mergers may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than anticipated.. Risks Relating to Our Financial Results and Need for Financing. We will need additional financing, which may be difficult to obtain. Our failure to obtain necessary financing or doing so on unattractive terms could result in the termination of our operations and the sale and license of our assets or otherwise adversely affect our research and development programs and other operations.. We had cash, cash equivalents and investments of approximately $112.6 million at December 31, 2017. We believe that, based on our current operating plan, our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments,  will enable us to fund our operations into the second quarter of 2019. Specifically, we believe that our available funds will be sufficient to enable us to:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcomplete the dose-finding portion of our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of IMO-2125 in combination with pembrolizumab in anti-PD1 refractory metastatic melanoma and complete enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of this trial in combination with iplilimumab;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinitiate a Phase 3 clinical trial of IMO-2125 in combination with iplilimumab for the treatment of anti-PD1 refractory metastatic melanoma;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontinue to enroll patients in our Phase 1b intra-tumoral monotherapy clinical trial of IMO-2125 in multiple refractory tumor types; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcomplete our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of IMO-8400 in patients with dermatomyositis.. We expect that we will need to raise additional funds in order to complete these trials, conduct any other clinical development of our TLR drug candidates or to conduct any other development of our nucleic acid chemistry technology, and to fund our operations. We are seeking and expect to continue to seek additional funding through collaborations, the sale or license of assets or financings of equity or debt securities. We believe that the key factors that will affect our ability to obtain funding are:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe results of our clinical and preclinical development activities in our rare disease program, our immuno-oncology program and our nucleic acid chemistry research program, and our ability to advance our drug candidates and nucleic acid chemistry technology on the timelines anticipated;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost, timing, and outcome of regulatory reviews;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompetitive and potentially competitive products and technologies and investors' receptivity to our drug candidates and the technology underlying them in light of competitive products and technologies;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe receptivity of the capital markets to financings by biotechnology companies generally and companies with drug candidates and technologies such as ours specifically; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to enter into additional collaborations with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and the success of such collaborations.. In addition, increases in expenses or delays in clinical development may adversely impact our cash position and require additional funds or cost reductions.. 32. Table of Contents. Financing may not be available to us when we need it or may not be available to us on favorable or acceptable terms or at all. We could be required to seek funds through collaborative alliances or through other means that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies, drug candidates or drugs that we would otherwise pursue on our own. In addition, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our then existing stockholders will experience dilution. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of existing stockholders. An equity financing that involves existing stockholders may cause a concentration of ownership. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, and are likely to include rights that are senior to the holders of our common stock. Any additional debt or equity financing may contain terms which are not favorable to us or to our stockholders, such as liquidation and other preferences, or liens or other restrictions on our assets. As discussed in Note 12 to the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, additional equity financings may also result in cumulative changes in ownership over a three-year period in excess of 50% which would limit the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that we may utilize in any one year.. If we are unable to obtain adequate funding on a timely basis or at all, we will be required to terminate, modify or delay preclinical or clinical trials of one or more of our drug candidates, significantly curtail or terminate discovery or development programs for new drug candidates or relinquish rights to portions of our technology, drug candidates and/or products.. We have incurred substantial losses and expect to continue to incur losses. We will not be successful unless we reverse this trend.. We have incurred losses in every year since our inception, except for 2002, 2008, and 2009 when our recognition of revenues under license and collaboration agreements resulted in our reporting net income for those years. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $604.5 million. Since January 1, 2001, we have primarily been involved in the development of our TLR pipeline. From January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2017, we incurred losses of $344.3 million. We incurred losses of $260.2 million prior to December 31, 2000, during which time we were primarily involved in the development of earlier generation antisense technology. These losses, among other things, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders' equity, total assets, and working capital.. We have never had any products of our own available for commercial sale and have received no revenues from the sale of drugs. As of December 31, 2017, substantially all of our revenues have been from collaborative and license agreements. We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, including clinical trials, and have not completed development of any drug candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses, whether or when any of our drug candidates will become commercially available, or when we will become profitable, if at all. We expect to incur substantial operating losses in future periods.. Risks Relating to Our Business, Strategy and Industry. We are depending heavily on the development of TLR-targeted drug candidates in our immuno-oncology program and for the treatment of certain rare diseases and on the development of drug candidates using our nucleic acid chemistry technology. If we terminate the development of any of our programs or any of our drug candidates in such programs, are unable to successfully develop and commercialize any of our drug candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business may be materially harmed.. We have invested a significant portion of our time and financial resources in the development of TLR-targeted clinical-stage drug candidates as part of our immuno-oncology and rare disease programs. In the future, we intend to invest a significant portion of our time and financial resources in the development of our TLR-targeted candidates in our immuno-oncology program and for the treatment of certain rare diseases. We also may invest substantial time and resources to further advance the development of drug candidates under our nucleic acid chemistry research program. For instance:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe are conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of IMO-2125, administered intra-tumorally, in combination with ipilimumab or pembrolizumab in patients with anti-PD1 refractory metastatic melanoma, a Phase 3. 33. Table of Contents. clinical trial of IMO-2125, administered intra-tumorally, in combination with ipilimumab in patients with anti-PD1 refractory metastatic melanoma, and a Phase 1b trial of IMO-2125, administered intra-tumorally, as a monotherapy in patients with refractory solid tumors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may conduct additional clinical trials of IMO-2125 in our immuno-oncology program in combination with checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of multiple tumor types;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe are conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial of IMO-8400 in patients with dermatomyositis; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe are developing compounds in our nucleic acid chemistry research program and plan to make a development decision for IDRA-008 based upon the totality of IND-enabling studies and our comparator pharmacology study with Volanesorsen.. We anticipate that our ability to generate product revenues will depend heavily on the successful development and commercialization of our TLR drug candidates in our rare disease and immuno-oncology programs, and the successful identification, development and commercialization of drug candidates in our nucleic acid chemistry research program.. Our ability to generate milestone and royalty revenues under any of our current collaborations, including our collaborations with Vivelix and GSK, and under any other collaboration that we enter into with respect to our other programs, will depend on the development and commercialization of the drug candidates being developed under the collaborations.. Our efforts and the efforts of our collaborators, including Vivelix and GSK, to develop and commercialize compounds, are at an early stage and are subject to many challenges. For instance, we previously experienced a setback with respect to our program for IMO-2125 for hepatitis C. In April 2011, we chose to delay initiation of our planned 12-week Phase 2 randomized clinical trial of IMO-2125 plus ribavirin in treatment-naïve, genotype 1 hepatitis C virus, or HCV, patients based on observations of lymphoproliferative malignancies in an ongoing 26-week chronic nonclinical toxicology study of IMO-2125 in rodents. We subsequently completed a 39-week chronic nonclinical toxicology study of IMO-2125 in non-human primates in which there were no similar observations. Also, in September 2016, we suspended our development program of IMO-8400 for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas and suspended our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trials of IMO-8400 in patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, harboring the MYD88 L265P oncogenic mutation due to several factors, including the lack of a strong clinical signal for Waldenström's macroglobulinemia patients and the inability to adequately enroll patients with DLBCL.. We have entered into and expect to continue to seek to enter into collaborative alliances with pharmaceutical companies to advance our TLR agonists and antagonist candidates and with respect to additional applications of our nucleic acid chemistry technology program. Our previous setbacks with respect to our program for IMO-2125 in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus and our program for IMO-8400 in patients with B-cell lymphomas could negatively impact our ability to license any of such compounds, or any of our other compounds, to a third party.. Our ability to successfully develop and commercialize these drug candidates, or other potential drug candidates, will depend on our ability to overcome these recent challenges and on several factors, including the following:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe drug candidates demonstrating activity in clinical trials;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe drug candidates demonstrating an acceptable safety profile in nonclinical toxicology studies and during clinical trials;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttimely enrollment in clinical trials of IMO-8400, IMO-2125 and other drug candidates, which may be slower than anticipated, potentially resulting in significant delays;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsatisfying conditions imposed on us and/or our collaborators by the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory authorities regarding the scope or design of clinical trials;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA, or equivalent foreign regulatory authorities, the safety and efficacy of the drug candidates through current and future clinical trials;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttimely receipt of necessary marketing approvals from the FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory authorities;. 34. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability to combine our drug candidates and the drug candidates being developed by our collaborators and any other collaborators safely and successfully with other therapeutic agents;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tachieving and maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to the products;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablishment of commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability to secure orphan drug exclusivity for our drug candidates either alone or in combination with other products;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe successful commercial launch of the drug candidates, assuming FDA approval is obtained, whether alone or in combination with other products;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacceptance of the products as safe and effective by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompetition from other companies and their therapies;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in treatment regimens;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfavorable market conditions in which to raise additional capital;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe strength of our intellectual property portfolio in the United States and abroad; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta continued acceptable safety and efficacy profile of the drug candidates following marketing approval.. We are in the early stages of developing our TLR9 agonists in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, which is a novel technology, and our efforts may not be successful or result in any approved and marketable products.. In June 2015, we entered into a strategic clinical research alliance with MD Anderson to advance clinical development of TLR9 agonists in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. We initiated the first trial from the research alliance, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of IMO-2125, administered intra-tumorally in combination with ipilimumab, a CTLA4 antibody, in patients with metastatic melanoma (anti-PD1 refractory) in the fourth quarter of 2015. While we have evaluated the safety profile of IMO-2125 in previous trials, in those trials we evaluated the safety profile of IMO-2125 by subcutaneous injection and not by intra-tumoral injection. In addition, while, as a marketed product, the safety profile of ipilimumab is known, the safety profile of the combination of IMO-2125 and ipilimumab has not been evaluated in previous trials. These factors may result in participating subjects experiencing serious adverse events or undesirable side effects or exposure to unacceptable health risks requiring us to suspend or terminate any clinical trials that we may conduct of IMO-2125 in combination with ipilimumab, or any other checkpoint inhibitor. Furthermore, we have expanded the Phase 1/2 clinical trial to include the assessment of safety and efficacy of IMO-2125, administered intra-tumorally in combination with pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 antibody in patients with metastatic melanoma (anti-PD1 refractory). While, as a marketed product, the safety profile of pembrolizumab is known, the safety profile of the combination of IMO-2125 and pembrolizumab has not been evaluated in previous trials and may result in participating subjects experiencing serious adverse events or undesirable side effects or exposure to unacceptable health risks requiring us to suspend or terminate any clinical trials that we may conduct of IMO-2125 in combination with pembrolizumab, or any other checkpoint inhibitor.. We are in the early stages of developing our nucleic acid chemistry program, which is a novel technology, and our efforts may not be successful or result in any approved and marketable products.. We are in the early stages of developing our nucleic acid chemistry technology program, and the scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing drugs based on this technology is limited.  In addition, the FDA has relatively limited experience with nucleic acid therapeutics, which may increase the complexity, uncertainty and length of the regulatory review process for our drug candidates. To date, the FDA has approved only five nucleic acid-based therapeutics for marketing and commercialization, and the FDA and its foreign counterparts have not yet established any definitive policies, practices or guidelines specifically in relation to these drugs.. The future success of our nucleic acid chemistry technology program depends on our success in identifying and developing marketable products based on such technology and the effectiveness of our platform. Although the results of our preclinical studies to date have been supportive of the viability of this technology, it is unknown whether these results are indicative of results that may be obtained in any future clinical trials that we may. 35. Table of Contents. conduct. We are currently undertaking an analysis of priority oncology and rare disease indications for development of drug candidates generated from our nucleic acid chemistry technology. We are also conducting preliminary analysis of nucleic acid chemistry compounds for an undisclosed renal gene target.. However, many steps must be successfully achieved prior to the declaration of a nucleic acid chemistry drug candidate and the initiation of clinical development. Given the level of uncertainty of our ability to successfully achieve these many steps and the uncertainty of the drug discovery and clinical development processes in general, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in developing any marketable products as a result of our efforts with respect to our nucleic acid chemistry technology program.. If we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.. We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our drug candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. For example, in September 2016, we suspended our clinical trial of IMO-8400 in patients with DLBCL harboring the MYD88 L265P oncogenic mutation due to difficulty in enrolling patients. Additionally, because there are a limited number of patients with dermatomyositis, or other rare diseases having indications for which we may determine to develop our TLR antagonists, our ability to enroll eligible patients in any clinical trials for these indications may be limited or may result in slower enrollment than we anticipated. In addition, some of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for drug candidates that treat the same indications as our drug candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors' drug candidates.. Patient enrollment is affected by other factors including the:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tseverity of the disease under investigation;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teligibility criteria for the trial in question;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tperceived risks and benefits of the TLR-targeted drug candidates under study;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tefforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tavailability of competing clinical trials or other therapies;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpatient referral practices of physicians;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our drug candidates, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.. If our clinical trials are unsuccessful, or if they are delayed or terminated, we may not be able to develop and commercialize our drug candidates.. In order to obtain regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our drug candidates, we are required to complete extensive clinical trials in humans to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates. Clinical trials are lengthy, complex, and expensive processes with uncertain results. We may not be able to complete any clinical trial of a potential product within any specified time period. Moreover, clinical trials may not show our potential products to be both safe and efficacious. The FDA or other equivalent foreign regulatory agencies may not allow us to complete these trials or commence and complete any other clinical trials.. The results from preclinical testing of a drug candidate that is under development may not be predictive of results that will be obtained in human clinical trials. In addition, the results of early human clinical trials may not be predictive of results that will be obtained in larger scale, advanced stage clinical trials.. 36. Table of Contents. Furthermore, interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results, and failure of any of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. Companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including companies with greater experience in preclinical testing and clinical trials than we have, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after demonstrating promising results in earlier trials. Moreover, effects seen in nonclinical studies, even if not observed in clinical trials, may result in limitations or restrictions on clinical trials. Numerous unforeseen events may occur during, or as a result of, preclinical testing, nonclinical testing or the clinical trial process that could delay or inhibit the ability to receive regulatory approval or to commercialize drug products.. Other companies developing drugs targeted to TLRs have experienced setbacks in clinical trials. These setbacks may result in enhanced scrutiny by regulators or institutional review boards, or IRBs, of clinical trials of our drug candidates, including our TLR-targeted drug candidates, which could result in regulators or IRBs prohibiting the commencement of clinical trials, requiring additional nonclinical studies as a precondition to commencing clinical trials or imposing restrictions on the design or scope of clinical trials that could slow enrollment of trials, increase the costs of trials or limit the significance of the results of trials. Such setbacks could also adversely impact the desire of investigators to enroll patients in, and the desire of patients to enroll in, clinical trials of our drug candidates.. Other events that could delay or inhibit conduct of our clinical trials include:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulators or IRBs may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnonclinical or clinical data may not be readily interpreted, which may lead to delays and/or misinterpretation;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour nonclinical tests, including toxicology studies, or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional nonclinical testing or clinical trials or we may abandon projects that we expect may not be promising;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe rate of enrollment or retention of patients in our clinical trials may be lower than we expect;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe might have to suspend or terminate our clinical trials if the participating subjects experience serious adverse events or undesirable side effects or are exposed to unacceptable health risks;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulators or IRBs may hold, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements, issues identified through inspections of manufacturing or clinical trial operations or clinical trial sites, or if, in their opinion, the participating subjects are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulators may hold or suspend our clinical trials while collecting supplemental information on, or clarification of, our clinical trials or other clinical trials, including trials conducted in other countries or trials conducted by other companies;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe, along with our collaborators and subcontractors, may not employ, in any capacity, persons who have been debarred under the FDA's Application Integrity Policy, or similar policy under foreign regulatory authorities. Employment of such debarred persons, even if inadvertent, may result in delays in the FDA's or foreign equivalent's review or approval of our drug candidates, or the rejection of data developed with the involvement of such person(s);. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe or our contract manufacturers may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our drug candidates for use in clinical trials;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of our clinical trials may be greater than we currently anticipate making continuation and/or completion improbable; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour drug candidates may not cause the desired effects or may cause undesirable side effects or our drug candidates may have other unexpected characteristics.. We do not know whether clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, if at all. Significant clinical trial delays also could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our drug candidates.. 37. Table of Contents. Delays in commencing clinical trials of potential products could increase our costs, delay any potential revenues, and reduce the probability that a potential product will receive regulatory approval.. Our drug candidates and our collaborators' drug candidates will require preclinical and other nonclinical testing and extensive clinical trials prior to submission of any regulatory application for commercial sales. In conducting clinical trials, we cannot be certain that any planned clinical trial will begin on time, if at all. Delays in commencing clinical trials of potential products could increase our drug candidate development costs, delay any potential revenues, reduce the potential length of patent exclusivity and reduce the probability that a potential product will receive regulatory approval.. Commencing clinical trials may be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays in:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmanufacturing sufficient quantities of drug candidate that satisfy the required quality standards for use in clinical trials;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdemonstrating sufficient safety to obtain regulatory approval for conducting a clinical trial;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treaching an agreement with any collaborators on all aspects of the clinical trial;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treaching agreement with contract research organizations, if any, and clinical trial sites on all aspects of the clinical trial;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tresolving any objections from the FDA or any regulatory authority on an IND or proposed clinical trial design;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtaining additional financing;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtaining IRB approval for conducting a clinical trial at a prospective site; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenrolling patients in order to commence the clinical trial.. The technologies on which we rely are unproven and may not result in any approved and marketable products.. Our technologies or therapeutic approaches are relatively new and unproven. We have focused our efforts on the research and development of RNA- and DNA-based compounds, or oligonucleotides, targeted to TLRs and on drug candidates using our nucleic acid technology. Neither we nor any other company have obtained regulatory approval to market such TLR-targeted drug candidates or drug candidates using our nucleic acid technology as therapeutic drugs, and no such products currently are being marketed. The results of preclinical studies with TLR-targeted compounds may not be indicative of results that may be obtained in clinical trials, and results we have obtained in the clinical trials we have conducted to date may not be predictive of results in subsequent large-scale clinical trials. Further, the chemical and pharmacological properties of RNA- and DNA-based compounds targeted to TLRs or of drug candidates using our nucleic acid technology may not be fully recognized in preclinical studies and small-scale clinical trials, and such compounds may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways that we have not yet identified.. Moreover, only five nucleic acid-based therapeutics have been approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States since 1998 and are currently being marketed.. As such, oligonucleotides as a chemical class of drug candidates have limited precedence for successful late-stage development and regulatory approval. As we progress our oligonucleotide drug candidates into Phase 2 clinical trials involving patients with severe disease and as we conduct long-term nonclinical toxicology studies, we expect to encounter an increased risk of generating clinical adverse events and nonclinical toxicology study results that will require careful interpretation. In animal toxicology studies, we have observed adverse treatment-related effects on serum complement as well as evidence of adverse kidney, vascular, and heart pathology in longer term dosing of animals with our oligonucleotide compounds, which we believe are consistent with data previously generated with other third party oligonucleotides. Given the limited experience in assessing the relevance of oligonucleotide-related adverse animal toxicology findings to humans, the clinical and regulatory context for interpreting the significance of such events and results is not well established.. 38. Table of Contents. As a result of these factors, we may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval to market any product. Furthermore, the commercial success of any of our drug candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities will depend upon their acceptance by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors as clinically useful, safe, and cost-effective. In addition, if products being developed by our competitors have negative clinical trial results or otherwise are viewed negatively, the perception of our technologies and market acceptance of our drug candidates could be impacted negatively.. Our setbacks with respect to our TLR-targeted compounds, together with the setbacks experienced by other companies developing oligonucleotides-based compounds and TLR-targeted compounds, may result in a negative perception of our technology and our TLR-targeted compounds, impact our ability to obtain marketing approval of these drug candidates and adversely affect acceptance of our technology and our TLR-targeted compounds by patients, the medical community and third-party payors.. Our efforts to educate the medical community on our potentially unique approaches may require greater resources than would be typically required for products based on conventional technologies or therapeutic approaches. The safety, efficacy, convenience, and cost-effectiveness of our drug candidates as compared to competitive products will also affect market acceptance.. We face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing drugs before or more successfully than us.. We are developing our TLR-targeted drug candidates for use in our immuno-oncology program and in the treatment of certain rare diseases. We are conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of IMO-2125, administered intra-tumorally, in combination with ipilimumab, a CTLA4 antibody, or pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic melanoma and plan to initiate additional clinical trials of IMO-2125 in our immuno-oncology program both as a monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of multiple tumor types. We are conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial of IMO-8400 in patients with dermatomyositis. We also entered into a collaborative alliance agreement with GSK, and expect to seek to enter into additional collaborative alliances with pharmaceutical companies with respect to applications of our nucleic acid chemistry technology research program. For all of these disease areas, there are many other companies, public and private, that are actively engaged in discovery, development, and commercializing products and technologies that may compete with our drug candidates and programs, including TLR-targeted compounds as well as non-TLR-targeted therapeutics.. We are aware of other companies including Dynavax Technologies Corporation, Mologen AG, BioLineRx Ltd., Innate Immunotherapeutics Ltd., VentiRx Pharmaceuticals Inc., Telormedix S.A., Gilead Sciences Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, AstraZeneca plc, Checkmate Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. that are developing TLR agonists and antagonists for various indications, including oncology and rare diseases.. Immuno-oncology, which utilizes a patient's own immune system to combat cancer, is currently an active area of research for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Interest in immuno-oncology is driven by recent efficacy data in cancers with historically bleak outcomes and the potential to achieve a cure or functional cure for some patients. As such, our efforts in this field will be competitive with a wide variety of different approaches. Any one of these competitive approaches may result in the development of novel technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly than any that we are developing. In addition, Dynavax is conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of an investigational TLR9 agonist in combination with checkpoint inhibitors and Checkmate is conducting a Phase 1b clinical trial of an investigational TLR9 agonist in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor.. Many of the drug development programs in dermatomyositis are focusing on expanding the use of drugs approved in different indications through investigator sponsored studies such as the ongoing studies of the monoclonal antibodies, belimumab and tocilizumab. We are not aware of other new chemical or molecular entities being developed for the treatment of dermatomyositis.. We are also developing nucleic acid chemistry drug candidates that we have created using our proprietary technology to inhibit the production of disease-associated proteins by targeting RNA. We also face competition from other companies working to develop novel drugs using technologies that may compete with our nucleic acid chemistry technology. We are aware of multiple companies that are developing technologies that use oligonucleotide-based compounds to inhibit the production of disease associated proteins. These technologies include, but are not limited to, antisense technology as well as RNAi. In the field of antisense technologies, we. 39. Table of Contents. compete with multiple companies, including Ionis and its partners, as well as WAVE Life Sciences and its partner. Ionis is currently marketing an antisense drug, Kynamro, and Biogen recently received FDA approval for its antisense drug Spinraza for spinal muscular atrophy.  Ionis has over two dozen antisense drug candidates in clinical trials. In the field of RNAi, our primary competition is with Alnylam, Dicerna, Miragen, and their respective partners. For example, Alnylam is developing multiple RNAi-based technologies and has six drug candidates in clinical trials. Any of the competing companies may develop gene-silencing technologies more rapidly and more effectively than us, and antisense technology and RNAi may become the preferred technology for drugs that target RNA in order to inhibit the production of disease-associated proteins.. Some of these potentially competitive products have been in development or commercialized for years, in some cases by large, well established pharmaceutical companies. Many of the marketed products have been accepted by the medical community, patients, and third-party payors. Our ability to compete may be affected by the previous adoption of such products by the medical community, patients, and third-party payors. Additionally, in some instances, insurers and other third-party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products, which makes branded products, such as is planned for our drug candidates upon commercialization, potentially less attractive, from a cost perspective, to buyers.. We recognize that other companies, including large pharmaceutical companies, may be developing or have plans to develop products and technologies that may compete with ours. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we have. In addition, many of our competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in undertaking preclinical studies and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products for use in health care and manufacturing, and marketing and selling approved products. Our competitors may discover, develop or commercialize products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly than any that we are developing. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours.. We anticipate that the competition with our drug candidates and technologies will be based on a number of factors including product efficacy, safety, availability, and price. The timing of market introduction of our drug candidates and competitive products will also affect competition among products. We expect the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete the clinical trials and approval processes, and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market to be important competitive factors. Our competitive position will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, to obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes, protect our intellectual property, and to secure sufficient capital resources for the period between technological conception and commercial sales.. Competition for technical and management personnel is intense in our industry, and we may not be able to sustain our operations or grow if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel.. Our success is highly dependent on the retention of principal members of our technical and management staff, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Vincent Milano.. We are a party to an employment agreement with Mr. Milano, which is terminable upon 15 days prior written notice at the election of either party and immediately in the event of a termination for cause (as defined therein). We do not carry key man life insurance for Mr. Milano.. Furthermore, our future growth will require hiring a number of qualified technical and management personnel. Accordingly, recruiting and retaining such personnel in the future will be critical to our success. There is intense competition from other companies and research and academic institutions for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities. If we are not able to continue to attract and retain, on acceptable terms, the qualified personnel necessary for the continued development of our business, we may not be able to sustain our operations or growth.. 40. Table of Contents. Risks Related to Regulatory Approval and Marketing of Our Drug Candidates and Other. Legal Compliance Matters. Even if we complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials, the marketing approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our drug candidates. As a result, we cannot predict when or if we, or any future collaborators, will obtain marketing approval to commercialize a drug candidate.. Our drug candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, marketing, promotion, sale and distribution, export and import are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, whose laws and regulations may differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market our drug candidates in the United States or in other countries until we, or any future collaborators, receive approval of an NDA from the FDA or marketing approval from applicable regulatory authorities outside of the United States.. All of the drug candidates that we are developing, or may develop in the future, will require additional research and development, extensive preclinical studies, nonclinical testing, clinical trials, and regulatory approval prior to any commercial sales. This process is lengthy, often taking a number of years, is uncertain, and is expensive. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the drug candidate's safety and purity. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities.. Since our inception, we have conducted clinical trials of a number of compounds and are planning to initiate clinical trials for a number of additional disease indications. Specifically:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe are conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of IMO-2125, administered intra-tumorally, in combination with ipilimumab or pembrolizumab in patients with anti-PD1 refractory metastatic melanoma, a Phase 3 clinical trial of IMO-2125, administered intra-tumorally, in combination with ipilimumab in patients with anti-PD1 refractory metastatic melanoma, and a Phase 1b trial of IMO-2125 administered intra-tumorally, as a monotherapy in patients with refractory solid tumors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may conduct additional clinical trials of IMO-2125 in our immuno-oncology program and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of multiple tumor types;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe are conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial of IMO-8400 in patients with dermatomyositis; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe are developing compounds in our nucleic acid chemistry research program and plan to make a development decision for IDRA-008 based upon the totality of IND-enabling studies and our comparator pharmacology study with Volanesorsen.. The FDA and other regulatory authorities may not approve any of our potential products for any indication.. We may need to address a number of technological challenges in order to complete development of our drug candidates. Moreover, these products may not be effective in treating any disease or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, unintended alteration of the immune system over time, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use. In addition, changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. The FDA and comparable authorities in other countries have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a drug candidate.. Any delay in obtaining or failure to obtain required approvals could materially adversely affect our ability or that of any collaborators we may have to generate revenue from the particular drug candidate, which likely would result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely impact our stock price.. 41. Table of Contents. Our failure to obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent our drug candidates from being marketed abroad, and any approval we are granted for our drug candidates in the United States would not assure approval of drug candidates in foreign jurisdictions.. In order to market and sell our drugs in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, we, and any future collaborators, must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The marketing approval process outside of the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside of the United States, it is required that the drug be approved for reimbursement before the drug can be approved for sale in that country. We, and any future collaborators, may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside of the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside of the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA.. Additionally, on June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. On March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom is derived from European Union directives and regulations, the referendum could materially impact the regulatory regime with respect to the approval of our drug candidates in the United Kingdom or the European Union. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, would prevent us from commercializing our drug candidates in the United Kingdom and/or the European Union and restrict our ability to generate revenue and achieve and sustain profitability. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the United Kingdom and/or European Union for our drug candidates, which could significantly and materially harm our business.. Even if we, or any future collaborators, obtain marketing approvals for our drug candidates, the terms of approvals and ongoing regulation of our drugs may limit how we, or they, manufacture and market our drugs, which could materially impair our ability to generate revenue.. Once marketing approval has been granted, an approved drug and its manufacturer and marketer are subject to ongoing review and extensive regulation. We, and any future collaborators, must therefore comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for any of our drug candidates for which we or they obtain marketing approval. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the drug's approved labeling. Thus, we, and any future collaborators, may not be able to promote any drugs we develop for indications or uses for which they are not approved.. In addition, manufacturers of approved drugs and those manufacturers' facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMPs, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and reporting requirements. We, our contract manufacturers, our future collaborators and their contract manufacturers could be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA to monitor and ensure compliance with cGMPs.. Accordingly, assuming we, or our future collaborators, receive marketing approval for one or more of our drug candidates, we, and our future collaborators, and our and their contract manufacturers will continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance and quality control.. If we, and our future collaborators, are not able to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, we, and our future collaborators, could have the marketing approvals for our drugs withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our, or our future collaborators', ability to market any future drugs could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability. Further, the cost of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.. 42. Table of Contents. Moreover, legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our drug candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the United States Congress of the FDA's approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us and any collaborators to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.. Any of our drug candidates for which we, or our future collaborators, obtain marketing approval in the future could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we, and our future collaborators, may be subject to substantial penalties if we, or they, fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we, or they, experience unanticipated problems with our drugs following approval.. Any of our drug candidates for which we, or our future collaborators, obtain marketing approval in the future, as well as the manufacturing processes, post-approval studies and measures, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such drug, among other things, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a drug candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including the requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, which could include requirements for a restricted distribution system.. The FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a drug. The FDA and other agencies, including the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, closely regulate and monitor the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure that they are manufactured, marketed and distributed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label use and if we, or our future collaborators, do not market any of our drug candidates for which we, or they, receive marketing approval for only their approved indications, we, or they, may be subject to warnings or enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violation of the FDCA and other statutes, including the False Claims Act, relating to the promotion and advertising of prescription drugs may lead to investigations or allegations of violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and state consumer protection laws.. In addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our drugs or their manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:. litigation involving patients taking our drug;.   restrictions on such drugs, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;.   restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a drug;. restrictions on drug distribution or use;.   requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;.   warning letters or untitled letters;. withdrawal of the drugs from the market;.   refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;.   recall of drugs;. fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;.   suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;. damage to relationships with any potential collaborators;.   unfavorable press coverage and damage to our reputation;. 43. Table of Contents. refusal to permit the import or export of drugs;.   drug seizure; or. injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.. Under the CURES Act and the Trump Administration's regulatory reform initiatives, the FDA's policies, regulations and guidance may be revised or revoked and that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates, which would impact our ability to generate revenue.. In December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and spur innovation, but its ultimate implementation is unclear. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.. We also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. For example, certain policies of the Trump administration may impact our business and industry. Namely, the Trump administration has taken several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA's ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. An under-staffed FDA could result in delays in the FDA's responsiveness or in its ability to review submissions or applications, issue regulations or guidance, or implement or enforce regulatory requirements in a timely fashion or at all. Moreover, on January 30, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order, applicable to all executive agencies, including the FDA, which requires that for each notice of proposed rulemaking or final regulation to be issued in fiscal year 2017, the agency shall identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed, unless prohibited by law. These requirements are referred to as the \"two-for-one\" provisions. This Executive Order includes a budget neutrality provision that requires the total incremental cost of all new regulations in the 2017 fiscal year, including repealed regulations, to be no greater than zero, except in limited circumstances. For fiscal years 2018 and beyond, the Executive Order requires agencies to identify regulations to offset any incremental cost of a new regulation and approximate the total costs or savings associated with each new regulation or repealed regulation. In interim guidance issued by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within OMB on February 2, 2017, the administration indicates that the \"two-for-one\" provisions may apply not only to agency regulations, but also to significant agency guidance documents. In addition, on February 24, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order directing each affected agency to designate an agency official as a \"Regulatory Reform Officer\" and establish a \"Regulatory Reform Task Force\" to implement the two-for-one provisions and other previously issued executive orders relating to the review of federal regulations, however it is difficult to predict how these requirements will be implemented, and the extent to which they will impact the FDA's ability to exercise its regulatory authority. If these executive actions impose constraints on the FDA's ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted.. We may not be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for applications of our TLR drug candidates.. Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States.. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for that exclusivity period. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and ten years in Europe. The European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable such that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.. 44. Table of Contents. In June 2017, the FDA granted us orphan drug designation for IMO-2125 for the treatment of melanoma Stages IIb to IV. However, there can be no assurance that we will obtain orphan drug designation or exclusivity for any other disease indications for which we develop IMO-2125, or for our other drug candidates. Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.. On August 3, 2017, Congress passed the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, or FDARA. FDARA, among other things, codified the FDA's pre-existing regulatory interpretation, to require that a drug sponsor demonstrate the clinical superiority of an orphan drug that is otherwise the same as a previously approved drug for the same rare disease in order to receive orphan drug exclusivity. The new legislation reverses prior precedent holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously requires that the FDA recognize the orphan exclusivity period regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. The FDA may further reevaluate the Orphan Drug Act and its regulations and policies. We do not know if, when, or how the FDA may change the orphan drug regulations and policies in the future, and it is uncertain how any changes might affect our business. Depending on what changes the FDA may make to its orphan drug regulations and policies, our business could be adversely impacted.. A fast track designation by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and does not increase the likelihood that drug candidates will receive marketing approval.. We intend to seek fast track designation for some applications of our drug candidates. If a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the drug sponsor may apply for FDA fast track designation. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant this designation, so even if we believe a particular drug candidate is eligible for this designation, we cannot assure you that the FDA would decide to grant it.. In November 2017, the FDA granted us fast track designation for IMO-2125 for the treatment of anti-PD1 refractory metastatic melanoma in combination with ipilimumab therapy.  However, even with fast track designation, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program.. A breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA for any application of our drug candidates may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that those drug candidates will receive marketing approval.. We may seek a breakthrough therapy designation for some applications of our drug candidates. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For drugs and biologics that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA are also eligible for accelerated approval.. Designation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe an application of one of our drug candidates meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a drug candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our drug candidates qualify as breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the products no longer meet the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.. 45. Table of Contents. If we are required by the FDA to obtain approval of a companion diagnostic in connection with and as a condition to approval of a drug candidate, and we do not obtain or we experience delays in obtaining FDA approval of a diagnostic device, we will not be able to commercialize the drug candidate and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.. According to FDA guidance, if the FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, the FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic is not also approved or cleared for that indication. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, companion diagnostics are regulated as medical devices and the FDA has generally required companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain Premarket Approval, or a PMA. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device's safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA approval is not guaranteed and may take considerable time, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval.. We do not have experience or capabilities in developing or commercializing diagnostics and plan to rely on third parties or collaborators to perform these functions. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States as medical devices and require separate regulatory approval prior to commercialization.. If we, or any third parties that we engage to assist us or any of our collaborators, are unable to successfully develop companion diagnostics for our TLR antagonist drug candidates that require a companion diagnostic, or experience delays in doing so:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe development of such TLR antagonist drug candidates may be adversely affected if we are unable to appropriately select patients for enrollment in our clinical trials;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuch TLR antagonist drug candidates may not receive marketing approval if their safe and effective use depends on a companion diagnostic; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may not realize the full commercial potential of any TLR antagonist drug candidate that receives marketing approval if, among other reasons, we are unable to appropriately identify patients with the specific oncogenic mutation targeted by such TLR antagonist drug candidate.. If any of these events were to occur, our business would be harmed, possibly materially.. We have only limited experience in regulatory affairs and our drug candidates are based on new technologies; these factors may affect our ability or the time we require to obtain necessary regulatory approvals.. We have only limited experience in filing the applications necessary to obtain regulatory approvals. Moreover, the products that result from our research and development programs will likely be based on new technologies and new therapeutic approaches that have not been extensively tested in humans. The regulatory requirements governing these types of products may be more rigorous than for conventional drugs. As a result, we may experience a longer regulatory process in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals of any product that we develop.. Our relationships with healthcare providers and physicians and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.. Healthcare providers, physicians and third party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare. 46. Table of Contents. laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. These include the following:.   Anti-Kickback Statute - the federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation or arranging of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;. False Claims Act - the federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government, with potential liability including mandatory treble damages and significant per-claim penalties, currently set at $5,500 to $11,000 per false claim;. HIPAA - the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters, and, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms and technical safeguards, with respect to maintaining the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;.   Transparency Requirements - federal laws require applicable manufacturers of covered drugs to report payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals; and. Analogous State and Foreign Laws - analogous state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, can apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services and are generally broad and are enforced by many different federal and state agencies as well as through private actions.. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.. Current and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us and any collaborators to obtain marketing approval of our drug candidates and may affect the prices we, or they, may obtain.. In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval of our drug candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability, or the ability of any collaborators, to profitably sell any products for which we, or they, obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any collaborators, may receive for any approved products.. 47. Table of Contents. For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the PPACA. Among the provisions of the PPACA of potential importance to our business and our drug candidates are the following:. an annual, non-deductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;. an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;. expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the civil False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;. a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices;. extension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability;. expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;. expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;. new requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;. a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and. a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, led to aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year that started in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional congressional action is taken, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our drug candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such drug candidate is prescribed or used. Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.. We expect that these healthcare reforms, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product and/or the level of reimbursement physicians receive for administering any approved product we might bring to market. Reductions in reimbursement levels may negatively impact the prices we receive or the frequency with which our products are prescribed or administered.  Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.  Since enactment of the PPACA, there have been numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law.  In May 2017, the House of Representatives passed legislation known as the American Health Care Act of 2017.  Thereafter, the Senate Republicans introduced and then updated a bill to replace the PPACA known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017. The Senate Republicans also introduced legislation to repeal the PPACA without companion legislation to replace it, and a \"skinny\" version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017.  In addition, the Senate considered proposed healthcare reform legislation known as the Graham-Cassidy bill.  None of these measures was passed by the Senate.. 48. Table of Contents. The Trump Administration has also taken executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the PPACA.  In January 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices.  In October 2017, the President signed a second Executive Order allowing for the use of association health plans and short-term health insurance, which may provide fewer health benefits than the plans sold through the PPACA exchanges.  At the same time, the Administration announced that it will discontinue the payment of cost-sharing reduction, or CSR, payments to insurance companies until Congress approves the appropriation of funds for such CSR payments. The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the PPACA.  A bipartisan bill to appropriate funds for CSR payments was introduced in the Senate, but the future of that bill is uncertain.. More recently, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by the President on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the \"individual mandate.\"  The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, will become effective in 2019.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal of the individual mandate will cause 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise.  Further, each chamber of the Congress has put forth multiple bills designed to repeal or repeal and replace portions of the PPACA. Although none of these measures has been enacted by Congress to date, Congress may consider other legislation to repeal and replace elements of the PPACA. Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace elements of the PPACA, during the next Congressional session.. We will continue to evaluate the effect that the PPACA and its possible repeal and replacement could have on our business.  It is possible that repeal and replacement initiatives, if enacted into law, could ultimately result in fewer individuals having health insurance coverage or in individuals having insurance coverage with less generous benefits.  While the timing and scope of any potential future legislation to repeal and replace PPACA provisions is highly uncertain in many respects, it is also possible that some of the PPACA provisions that generally are not favorable for the research-based pharmaceutical industry could also be repealed along with PPACA coverage expansion provisions Accordingly, such reforms, if enacted, could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from drug candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain marketing approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop commercialize drug candidates.. The costs of prescription pharmaceuticals in the United States has also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States, and members of Congress and the Administration have stated that they will address such costs through new legislative and administrative measures.  The pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is also subject to governmental control outside the United States.  In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our drug candidates to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our ability to generate revenues and become profitable could be impaired.  In the European Union, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize our products. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the European Union or member state level may result in significant additional requirements or obstacles that may increase our operating costs.. Moreover, legislative and regulatory proposals have also been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical drugs. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our drug candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by Congress of the FDA's approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us and any future collaborators to more stringent drug labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.. 49. Table of Contents. Laws and regulations governing any international operations we may have in the future may preclude us from developing, manufacturing and selling certain drug candidates outside of the United States and require us to develop and implement costly compliance programs.. We are subject to numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction outside the United States in which we operate. The creation, implementation and maintenance of international business practices compliance programs is costly and such programs are difficult to enforce, particularly where reliance on third parties is required.. The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA are enforced primarily by the DOJ. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, is involved with enforcement of the books and records provisions of the FCPA.. Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.. Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. Our expansion outside of the United States, has required, and will continue to require, us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain drugs and drug candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs. The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial penalties, including suspension or debarment from government contracting. Violation of the FCPA can result in significant civil and criminal penalties. Indictment alone under the FCPA can lead to suspension of the right to do business with the U.S. government until the pending claims are resolved. Conviction of a violation of the FCPA can result in long-term disqualification as a government contractor. The termination of a government contract or relationship as a result of our failure to satisfy any of our obligations under laws governing international business practices would have a negative impact on our operations and harm our reputation and ability to procure government contracts. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA's accounting provisions.. Governments outside of the United States tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues from the sales of drugs, if any.. In some countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a drug. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we, or our future collaborators, may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our drug to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our drugs is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed.. If we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business.. We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological and radioactive materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or. 50. Table of Contents. injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.. Although we maintain workers' compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or commercialization efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.. Our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could cause significant liability for us and harm our reputation.. We are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct, including intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, comply with manufacturing standards we have established, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws, standards or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.. Risks Relating to Collaborators. Our existing collaborations and any collaborations we enter into in the future may not be successful.. Historically, an important element of our business strategy has included entering into collaborative alliances with corporate collaborators, primarily large pharmaceutical companies, for the development, commercialization, marketing, and distribution of some of our drug candidates. In December 2006, we entered into an exclusive license and research collaboration with Merck & Co. to research, develop, and commercialize vaccine products containing our TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 agonists in the fields of cancer, infectious diseases, and Alzheimer's disease. In November 2015, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with GSK for the development of our nucleic acid chemistry technology for certain renal indications and in November 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Vivelix granting them exclusive rights for the development of IMO-9200 for non-malignant indication of the GI Field.. Any collaboration we enter into may not be successful. The success of our collaborative alliances, if any, will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. Our existing collaborations and any potential future collaborations have risks, including the following:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour collaborators may control the development of the drug candidates being developed with our technologies and compounds including the timing of development;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour collaborators may control the development of the companion diagnostic to be developed for use in conjunction with our drug candidates including the timing of development;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour collaborators may control the public release of information regarding the developments, and we may not be able to make announcements or data presentations on a schedule favorable to us;. 51. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisputes may arise in the future with respect to the ownership of or right to use technology and intellectual property developed with our collaborators;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisagreements with our collaborators could delay or terminate the research, development or commercialization of products, or result in litigation or arbitration;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may have difficulty enforcing the contracts if any of our collaborators fail to perform;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour collaborators may terminate their collaborations with us, which could make it difficult for us to attract new collaborators or adversely affect the perception of us in the business or financial communities;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour collaboration agreements are likely to be for fixed terms and subject to termination by our collaborators in the event of a material breach or lack of scientific progress by us;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour collaborators may have the first right to maintain or defend our intellectual property rights and, although we would likely have the right to assume the maintenance and defense of our intellectual property rights if our collaborators do not, our ability to do so may be compromised by our collaborators' acts or omissions;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour collaborators may challenge our intellectual property rights or utilize our intellectual property rights in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property rights or expose us to potential liability;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour collaborators may not comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, or may fail to report safety data in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour collaborators may change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies historically have re-evaluated their priorities following mergers and consolidations, which have been common in recent years in these industries. The ability of our drug candidates to reach their potential could be limited if our collaborators decrease or fail to increase spending relating to such drug candidates;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour collaborators may under fund or not commit sufficient resources to the testing, marketing, distribution or development of our drug candidates; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour collaborators may develop alternative products either on their own or in collaboration with others, or encounter conflicts of interest or changes in business strategy or other business issues, which could adversely affect their willingness or ability to fulfill their obligations to us.. Given these risks, it is possible that any collaborative alliance into which we enter may not be successful. Collaborations with pharmaceutical companies and other third parties often are terminated or allowed to expire by the other party. The termination or expiration of our current collaboration agreements or any other collaboration agreement that we enter into in the future may adversely affect us financially and could harm our business reputation.. If we are unable to establish additional collaborative alliances, our business may be materially harmed.. Collaborators provide the necessary resources and drug development experience to advance our compounds in their programs. We have entered into and expect to continue to seek to enter into collaborative alliances with pharmaceutical companies to advance our TLR agonist and antagonist candidates and with respect to additional applications of our nucleic acid chemistry technology research program. Upfront payments and milestone payments received from collaborations help to provide us with the financial resources for our internal research and development programs. Our internal programs are focused on developing TLR-targeted drug candidates for the potential treatment of certain rare diseases and in our immuno-oncology program and on nucleic acid chemistry drug candidates. We believe that additional resources will be required to advance compounds in all of these areas. If we do not reach agreements with additional collaborators in the future, we may not be able to obtain the expertise and resources necessary to achieve our business objectives, our ability to advance our compounds will be jeopardized and we may fail to meet our business objectives.. We may have difficulty establishing additional collaborative alliances, particularly with respect to our TLR-targeted drug candidates and technology and our nucleic acid chemistry technology. For example, potential. 52. Table of Contents. collaborators may note that our prior TLR collaborations with Novartis and with Merck KGaA have been terminated. Potential collaborators may also be reluctant to establish collaborations with respect to IMO-2125 or IMO-8400, given our prior setbacks with respect to these drug candidates. We also face, and expect to continue to face, significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators.. Even if a potential partner were willing to enter into a collaborative alliance with respect to our TLR-targeted compounds or technology or our nucleic acid chemistry technology, the terms of such a collaborative alliance may not be on terms that are favorable to us. Moreover, collaborations are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document, and implement. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaborations on a timely basis.. Risks Relating to Intellectual Property. If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our discoveries, the value of our technology and products will be adversely affected.. Our patent positions, and those of other drug discovery companies, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific, and factual questions. Our ability to develop and commercialize drugs depends in significant part on our ability to:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtain licenses to the proprietary rights of others on commercially reasonable terms;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toperate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprotect our trade secrets.. We do not know whether any of our currently pending patent applications or those patent applications that we license will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents and those that may be issued in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable, narrowed in the course of a post-issuance proceeding or circumvented, and the rights granted thereunder may not provide us proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Moreover, intellectual property laws may change and negatively impact our ability to obtain issued patents covering our technologies or to enforce any patents that issue. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing, and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thus reducing any advantage provided by the patent.. Because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and because publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, neither we nor our licensors can be certain that we or they were the first to make the inventions claimed in issued patents or pending patent applications, or that we or they were the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in these patent applications.. As of February 15, 2018, we owned about 49 U.S. patents and patent applications and about 136 patents and patent applications throughout the rest of the world for our TLR-targeted immune modulation technologies. These patents and patent applications include claims covering the chemical compositions of matter and methods of use of our IMO compounds, such as IMO-8400, IMO-9200 and IMO-2125, as well as other compounds. These patents expire at various dates ranging from 2023 to 2037. With respect to IMO-8400, we have five issued U.S. patents that cover the chemical composition of matter of IMO-8400 and certain methods of its use that provide exclusivity for IMO-8400 until at least 2031. With respect to IMO-9200, we have six issued U.S. patents and two U.S. patent applications that cover the chemical composition for IMO-9200 and methods of its use that provide exclusivity for IMO-9200 until at least 2034. With respect to IMO-2125, we have an issued U.S. patent that covers the chemical composition of matter of IMO-2125 and methods of its use that will expire in 2025. We have pending applications in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. that cover methods of treatment or use with IMO-2125 with expiration dates of 2035 and 2037.. 53. Table of Contents. As of February 15, 2018, we owned three issued U.S. patents, 25 issued foreign patents, five pending U.S. patent applications and 12 foreign patent applications (including pending applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT) related to our nucleic acid chemistry compounds and methods of their use. The issued patents covering our nucleic acid chemistry technologies have an earliest statutory expiration date in 2030. One patent family relating to targets for our nucleic acid chemistry compounds is in-licensed.. Third parties may own or control patents or patent applications and require us to seek licenses, which could increase our development and commercialization costs, or prevent us from developing or marketing products.. Although we have many issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and other countries, we may not have rights under certain third-party patents or patent applications related to our compounds under development. Third parties may own or control these patents and patent applications in the United States and abroad. In particular, we are aware of certain third-party U.S. patents that contain claims related to immunostimulatory polynucleotides and their use to stimulate an immune response, as well as to antisense technology. Although we do not believe any of our TLR or antisense compounds under development infringe any valid claim of these patents, we cannot be assured that the holder of such patents would not seek to assert such patents against us or, if the holder did, that the courts would not interpret the claims of such patents more broadly than we believe appropriate and determine that we are in infringement of such patents. In addition, there may be other patents and patent applications related to our current or future drug candidates of which we are not aware. Therefore, in some cases, in order to develop, manufacture, sell or import some of our drug candidates, we or our collaborators may choose to seek, or be required to seek, licenses under third-party patents issued in the United States and abroad or under third-party patents that might issue from U.S. and foreign patent applications. In such an event, we would be required to pay license fees or royalties or both to the licensor. If licenses are not available to us on acceptable terms, we or our collaborators may not be able to develop, manufacture, sell or import these products, or may be delayed in doing so. Either of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business.. We may become involved in expensive patent litigation or other proceedings, which could result in our incurring substantial costs and expenses or substantial liability for damages, require us to stop our development and commercialization efforts or result in our patents being invalidated, interpreted narrowly or limited.. There has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology industry. We may become a party to various types of patent litigation or other proceedings regarding intellectual property rights from time to time even under circumstances where we are not practicing and do not intend to practice any of the intellectual property involved in the proceedings.. In addition to litigation, we may become involved in patent office proceedings, including oppositions, reexaminations, supplemental examinations and inter partes reviews involving our patents or the patents of third parties. We may initiate such proceedings or have such proceedings brought against us. An adverse determination in any such proceeding, or in litigation, could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future drug candidates. An adverse determination in a proceeding involving a patent in our portfolio could result in the loss of protection or a narrowing in the scope of protection provided by that patent.. The cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the cost of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. If any patent litigation or other proceeding is resolved against us, we or our collaborators may be enjoined from developing, manufacturing, selling or importing our drugs without a license from the other party and we may be held liable for significant damages. We may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially acceptable terms or at all. In a patent office proceeding, such as an opposition, reexamination or inter partes review, our patents may be narrowed or invalidated.. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time.. 54. Table of Contents. Risks Relating to Product Manufacturing, Marketing and Sales, and Reliance on Third Parties. Because we have limited manufacturing experience, and no manufacturing facilities or infrastructure, we are dependent on third-party manufacturers to manufacture drug candidates for us. If we cannot rely on third-party manufacturers, we will be required to incur significant costs and devote significant efforts to establish our own manufacturing facilities and capabilities.. We have limited manufacturing experience and no manufacturing facilities, infrastructure or clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. In order to continue to develop our drug candidates, apply for regulatory approvals, and ultimately commercialize products, we need to develop, contract for or otherwise arrange for the necessary manufacturing capabilities.. We currently rely upon third parties to produce material for nonclinical and clinical testing purposes and expect to continue to do so in the future. We also expect to rely upon third parties to produce materials that may be required for the commercial production of our drug candidates, if approved. Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our drug candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to develop drug candidates and commercialize any drug candidates on a timely and competitive basis. We currently do not have any long term supply contracts.. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under the FDA's cGMP regulations capable of manufacturing our drug candidates. As a result, we may have difficulty finding manufacturers for our drug candidates with adequate capacity for our needs. If we are unable to arrange for third-party manufacturing of our drug candidates on a timely basis, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete development of our drug candidates or market them.. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured drug candidates ourselves, including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities or otherwise, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe potential that third-party manufacturers will develop know-how owned by such third party in connection with the production of our drug candidates that becomes necessary for the manufacture of our drug candidates; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treliance upon third-party manufacturers to assist us in preventing inadvertent disclosure or theft of our proprietary knowledge.. Any contract manufacturers with which we enter into manufacturing arrangements will be subject to ongoing periodic, unannounced inspections by the FDA, or foreign equivalent, and corresponding state and foreign agencies or their designees to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other governmental regulations and corresponding foreign standards. Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with such requirements, regulations or standards could lead to a delay in the conduct of our clinical trials, or a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates. Such failure could also result in sanctions being imposed, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, product seizures or recalls, imposition of operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, or criminal prosecution.. Additionally, contract manufacturers may not be able to manufacture our drug candidates at a cost or in quantities necessary to make them commercially viable. As of February 15, 2018, our third-party manufacturers have met our manufacturing requirements, but we cannot be assured that they will continue to do so. Furthermore, changes in the manufacturing process or procedure, including a change in the location where the drug substance or drug product is manufactured or a change of a third-party manufacturer, may require prior FDA review and approval in accordance with the FDA's cGMP and New Drug Application/biologics license application regulations.. 55. Table of Contents. Contract manufacturers may also be subject to comparable foreign requirements. This review may be costly and time-consuming and could delay or prevent the launch of a drug candidate. The FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies at any time may also implement new standards, or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards for manufacture, packaging or testing of products. If we or our contract manufacturers are unable to comply, we or they may be subject to regulatory action, civil actions or penalties.. We have no experience selling, marketing or distributing products and no internal capability to do so.. If we receive regulatory approval to commence commercial sales of any of our drug candidates, we will face competition with respect to commercial sales, marketing, and distribution. These are areas in which we have no experience. To market any of our drug candidates directly, we would need to develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capability. In particular, we would need to recruit experienced marketing and sales personnel. Alternatively, we could engage a pharmaceutical or other healthcare company with an existing distribution system and direct sales force to assist us. However, to the extent we entered into such arrangements, we would be dependent on the efforts of third parties. If we are unable to establish sales and distribution capabilities, whether internally or in reliance on third parties, our business would suffer materially.. If third parties on whom we rely for clinical trials do not perform as contractually required or as we expect, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our drug candidates and our business may suffer.. We do not have the ability to independently conduct the clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates. We depend on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations, and other third-party service providers in the conduct of the clinical trials of our drug candidates and expect to continue to do so. We have contracted with contract research organizations to manage our ongoing clinical trials of IMO-2125 and IMO-8400 and expect to contract with such organizations for future clinical trials. We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials, but do not control many aspects of their activities. We are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies require us to comply with certain standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, and applicable regulatory requirements, for conducting, recording, and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity, and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule, or at all, or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols. If these third parties fail to carry out their obligations, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties. This could be difficult, costly or impossible, and our preclinical studies or clinical trials may need to be extended, delayed, terminated or repeated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval in a timely fashion, or at all, for the applicable drug candidate, or to commercialize such drug candidate being tested in such studies or trials. If we seek to conduct any of these activities ourselves in the future, we will need to recruit appropriately trained personnel and add to our research, clinical, quality and corporate infrastructure.. The commercial success of any drug candidates that we may develop will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical community.. Any products that we ultimately bring to the market, if they receive marketing approval, may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors or others in the medical community. For example, current cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiation therapy are well established in the medical community, and doctors may continue to rely on these treatments. If our products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate product revenue and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our products, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe prevalence and severity of any side effects, including any limitations or warnings contained in the product's approved labeling;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe efficacy and potential advantages over alternative treatments;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability to offer our drug candidates for sale at competitive prices;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trelative convenience and ease of administration;. 56. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe strength of marketing and distribution support and the timing of market introduction of competitive products; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpublicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments.. Even if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile, market acceptance of the product will not be known until after it is launched. Our efforts to educate patients, the medical community, and third-party payors on the benefits of our drug candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful. Such efforts to educate the marketplace may require more resources than are required by conventional technologies marketed by our competitors.. If we are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for any products that we may develop or acceptable prices for those products, our revenues and prospects for profitability will suffer.. Most patients rely on Medicare, Medicaid, private health insurers, and other third-party payors to pay for their medical needs, including any drugs we may market. If third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage or reimbursement for any products that we may develop, our revenues and prospects for profitability will suffer. Congress enacted a limited prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. While the program established by this statute may increase demand for our products if we were to participate in this program, our prices will be negotiated with drug procurement organizations for Medicare beneficiaries and are likely to be lower than we might otherwise obtain. Non-Medicare third-party drug procurement organizations may also base the price they are willing to pay on the rate paid by drug procurement organizations for Medicare beneficiaries or may otherwise negotiate the price they are willing to pay.. A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry is toward cost containment. In addition, in some foreign countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six months or longer after the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our drug candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization of our drug candidates. These further clinical trials would require additional time, resources, and expenses. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our prospects for generating revenue, if any, could be adversely affected and our business may suffer.. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act became law. These health care reform laws are intended to broaden access to health insurance; reduce or constrain the growth of health care spending, especially Medicare spending; enhance remedies against fraud and abuse; add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries; impose new taxes and fees on certain sectors of the health industry; and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the new fees is an annual assessment on makers of branded pharmaceuticals and biologics, under which a company's assessment is based primarily on its share of branded drug sales to federal health care programs. Such fees could affect our future prospects for profitability. Although it is too early to determine the effect of the health care legislation on our future prospects for profitability and financial condition, the law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.. Third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit reimbursement for newly-approved health care products. These third-party payors may base their coverage and reimbursement on the coverage and reimbursement rate paid by carriers for Medicare beneficiaries. Furthermore, many such payors are investigating or implementing methods for reducing health care costs, such as the establishment of capitated or prospective payment systems. Cost containment pressures have led to an increased emphasis on the use of cost-effective products by health care providers. In particular, third-party payors may limit the indications for which they will reimburse patients who use any products that we may develop. Cost control initiatives could limit the price we might establish for products that we or our current or future collaborators may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us.. 57. Table of Contents. We face a risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain insurance.. Our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that is inherent in the manufacturing, testing, and marketing of human therapeutic drugs. We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our drug candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims and product recalls may result in:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdecreased demand for our drug candidates and products;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdamage to our reputation;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory investigations that could require costly recalls or product modifications;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twithdrawal of clinical trial participants;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcosts to defend related litigation;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsubstantial monetary awards to clinical trial participants or patients, including awards that substantially exceed our product liability insurance, which we would then have to pay using other sources, if available, and would damage our ability to obtain liability insurance at reasonable costs, or at all, in the future;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of revenue;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe diversion of management's attention away from managing our business; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.. Although we have product liability and clinical trial liability insurance that we believe is adequate, this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations. We may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate protection against potential liabilities. If we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we will be exposed to significant liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial position. These liabilities could prevent or interfere with our commercialization efforts.. Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock. Our corporate governance structure, including provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law, may prevent a change in control or management that stockholders may consider desirable.. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company or discourage a third party from attempting to take over our company. These provisions include:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta classified board of directors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimitations on the removal of directors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval.. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes restrictions on our ability to engage in business combinations and other specified transactions with significant stockholders. These provisions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us or a change in our management that stockholders may consider favorable or beneficial. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.. 58. Table of Contents. We have two significant securityholders. If these securityholders choose to act together, they could exert substantial influence over our business. In addition, in connection with any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, they would be entitled to receive consideration in excess of their reported beneficial ownership of our common stock.. As of February 15, 2018, Baker Bros. Advisors LP, and certain of its affiliated funds, which we refer to collectively as Baker Brothers, held 18,325,135 shares of our common stock, warrants to purchase up to 20,316,327 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.47 per share and pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 22,151,052 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. In addition, two members of our board of directors are affiliates of Baker Brothers. Under the terms of the warrants and pre-funded warrants issued to Baker Brothers, Baker Brothers is not permitted to exercise such warrants to the extent that such exercise would result in Baker Brothers (and its affiliates) beneficially owning more than 4.999% of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants. Baker Brothers has the right to increase this beneficial ownership limitation in its discretion on 61 days' prior written notice to us, provided that in no event is Baker Brothers permitted to exercise such warrants to the extent that such exercise would result in Baker Brothers (and its affiliates) beneficially owning more than 19.99% of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding or the combined voting power of our securities outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants. On March 5, 2018, Baker Brothers provided us such 61 days' notice in regards to the above mentioned warrants to purchase up to 20,316,327 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.47 per share. After giving effect to the 4.999% beneficial ownership limitation currently in effect with respect to the warrants and pre-funded warrants held by Baker Brothers, as of February 15, 2018, Baker Brothers beneficially owned 9.5% of our outstanding common stock. If the warrants and pre-funded warrants held by Baker Brothers could be exercised without this limitation, then as of February 15, 2018, Baker Brothers would have beneficially owned 25.6% of our common stock. The information in this paragraph is based on a Schedule 13D/A filed with the SEC on October 30, 2017; a Form 4 filed with the SEC on January 4, 2018; and on information provided to us by Baker Brothers. On February 9, 2015, we entered into a registration rights agreement with Baker Brothers, pursuant to which we agreed to file registration statements to register for resale the shares of our common stock, including shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants, held by Baker Brothers. As of February 15, 2018, entities affiliated with Pillar Invest Corporation, which we refer to collectively as the Pillar Investment Entities, held 25,413,574 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to 1,200,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.47 per share. As of February 15, 2018, the Pillar Investment Entities beneficially owned 13.6% of our outstanding common stock.  The Pillar Investment Entities are subject to contractual limitations that limit their ability to exercise any securities held by them that are exercisable into shares of our common stock to the extent that such exercise would result in the Pillar Investment Entities and their affiliates beneficially owning more than 19.99% of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding or the combined voting power of our securities outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such securities.  The information in this paragraph is based on a Schedule 13D/A filed with the SEC on October 17, 2016; Form 4s filed with the SEC on May 3, 2017, October 17, 2017, December 15, 2017 and January 19, 2018; and on information provided to us by Pillar Invest Corporation.. Although there are contractual limitations on the beneficial ownership of Baker Brothers and the Pillar Investment Entities, which we refer to collectively as our significant securityholders, if our significant securityholders were to exercise their warrants for common stock and were to choose to act together, they could be able to exert substantial influence over our business. This concentration of voting power could delay, defer or prevent a change of control, entrench our management and the board of directors or delay or prevent a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us on terms that other stockholders may desire. In addition, conflicts of interest could arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and either or both of our significant securityholders on the other hand, concerning potential competitive business activities, business opportunities, the issuance of additional securities and other matters. Furthermore in the event of a sale of our company, whether by merger, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or otherwise, our significant securityholders would be entitled to receive, with respect to each share of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants then held by them and without regard to the beneficial ownership limitations imposed on the conversion or exercise of such securities, the same amount and kind of securities, cash or property as they would have been entitled to receive if such securities had been converted into or exercised for shares of our common stock immediately prior to such sale of our company. Because the significant securityholders would receive this sale consideration with respect to warrants not included in their reported beneficial ownership of our common. 59. Table of Contents. stock, in the event of a sale of our company, they would be entitled to receive a significantly larger portion of the total proceeds distributable to the holders of our securities than is represented by their reported beneficial ownership of our common stock.. Our stock price has been and may in the future be extremely volatile. In addition, because our common stock has historically been traded at low volume levels, our investors' ability to trade our common stock may be limited. As a result, investors may lose all or a significant portion of their investment.. Our stock price has been and may in the future be volatile. During the period from January 1, 2017 to February 15, 2018, the closing sales price of our common stock ranged from a high of $2.87 per share to a low of $1.30 per share. The stock market has also experienced periods of significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices  of biotechnology companies in particular have been highly volatile, often for reasons that have been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour cash resources;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttiming and results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials of our drug candidates or those of our competitors;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe regulatory status of our drug candidates;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure of any of our drug candidates, if approved, to achieve commercial success;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe success of competitive products or technologies;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour success in entering into collaborative agreements;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelopments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe departure of key personnel;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to maintain the listing of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market or an alternative national securities exchange;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe terms of any financing consummated by us;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and issuance of new or changed securities analysts' reports or recommendations; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic, industry, and market conditions.. In addition, our common stock has historically been traded at low volume levels and may continue to trade at low volume levels. As a result, any large purchase or sale of our common stock could have a significant impact on the price of our common stock and it may be difficult for investors to sell our common stock in the market without depressing the market price for the common stock or at all.. The announcement and pendency of the Mergers, whether or not consummated, may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our business prospects. In the event that the Mergers are not completed, the announcement of the termination of the Merger Agreement may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our business prospects.. As a result of the foregoing, investors may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price they paid for such shares. Investors in our common stock must be willing to bear the risk of fluctuations in the price of our common stock and the risk that the value of their investment in our stock could decline.. 60. Table of Contents. Because we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, investor returns will be limited to any increase in the value of our stock.. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. In addition, under the terms of our loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC, we are required to obtain the prior written consent of Oxford Finance LLC in order to declare or pay a cash dividend on our common stock in an amount in excess of $500,000 in any fiscal year. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to support our operations and finance the growth and development of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock, if any.. Our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation that allows our board of directors to effect a reverse stock split by a ratio within a specified range, which reverse stock split, if implemented, may not achieve one or more of our objectives.. There can be no assurance that the market price per new share of our common stock after a reverse stock split will remain unchanged or increase in proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding before the reverse stock split. The market price of our shares may fluctuate and potentially decline after a reverse stock split. Accordingly, the total market capitalization of our common stock after a reverse stock split, if implemented, may be lower than the total market capitalization before the reverse stock split. Moreover, in the future, the market price of our common stock following a reverse stock split may not exceed or remain higher than the market price prior to the reverse stock split.. In addition, while our board of directors believes that a higher stock price may help generate investor interest, there can be no assurance that a reverse stock split will result in a per-share market price that will attract institutional investors or investment funds or that such share price will satisfy the investing guidelines of institutional investors or investment funds. As a result, the trading liquidity of our common stock may not necessarily improve. Further, if a reverse stock split is effected and the market price of our common stock declines, the percentage decline may be greater than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock split.. Following the reverse stock split, if implemented, the number of our outstanding shares will be reduced by a whole number factor ranging from four to eight, which may lead to reduced trading and a smaller number of market makers for our common stock. Brokerage firms often do not permit stocks trading below $5.00 per share to be sold short, but permit short-selling of shares which are traded at higher prices. Following the reverse stock split, to the extent our per-share trading price is consistently above $5.00, investors may short our stock. This may increase the volatility of our stock price."
