[1] "Item 1A.  Risk Factors. Before investing in any of our securities, you should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information set forth in this Form 10-K. These risks could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition and could cause the trading price of our securities to decline. You could lose all or part of your investment. The headings used in this section are solely to aid the reader as to general categories of risks related to investing in the Company. Many of the risk factors listed apply to more than one category or to the Company generally. Accordingly, the headings used in this section should not be construed as limiting in any manner the general applicability of any of the risk factors included in this section. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations.. UNDERWRITING RISKS. As a catastrophe reinsurer, we are particularly vulnerable to losses from catastrophes.. We are exposed to claims arising out of catastrophes. Catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable events, including earthquakes, hurricanes, hailstorms, severe weather, floods, fires, tornadoes, volcano eruptions, explosions and other natural or man-made disasters. Many scientists believe that the earth's atmospheric and oceanic temperatures are increasing and that, in recent years, changing climate conditions have increased the unpredictability, severity and frequency of natural disasters in certain parts of the world.. The global geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposure for natural events occurring in a number of areas throughout the world, including, but not limited to, windstorms in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, hurricanes in Florida, the Gulf Coast and the Atlantic coast regions of the United States, typhoons and earthquakes in Japan, New Zealand, Australia and other parts of Southeast Asia, earthquakes in California and the Pacific Northwest and New Madrid region of the United States and hail, tornado and flooding in the Midwestern United States. From time to time, we may have greater exposures in one or more of these geographic areas than our overall share of the worldwide market might suggest. Accordingly, when and if catastrophes occur in these areas, we may experience relatively more severe negative results from such events than our competitors.. In addition, changing climate conditions, primarily rising global temperatures, may be increasing, or may in the future increase the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes, including weather events, and may create new types of catastrophe losses. We expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property will increase the severity of such occurrences in the future. In the event that we experience catastrophe losses, there is a possibility that our premiums will be inadequate to cover these risks. In addition, because accounting regulations do not permit reinsurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur, claims from catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the estimation of reserves related to catastrophic events can be affected by the inability to access portions of the affected areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, legal and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information available to establish the reserves. Complex factors include but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind; evaluating pollution exposures; estimating additional living expenses; the impact of demand surge; infrastructure disruption; fraud; the effect of mold damage; business interruption costs; and reinsurance collectability. The timing of a catastrophe's occurrence, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to us in estimating reserves for that reporting period. The estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge and additional information becomes available. Our ability to write new business also could be adversely impacted.. As a fully-collateralized reinsurer, any sudden and substantial calls upon our collateral resources may prevent us from being able to enter into future collateralized reinsurance contracts.. The Manager manages some of our key quantifiable risks using a combination of proprietary risk management models and systems, various third-party models and its underwriting judgment. The models utilized by the Manager help it to control risk accumulation, to inform our management and to improve our risk/return profile; however, these models may prove to be inaccurate and may understate our exposures. The Manager focuses on tracking exposed contract limits, estimating the potential impact of a single catastrophe event, and simulating our annual performance to reflect our aggregate underwriting and investment risk. We cannot assure you that any of these techniques, including the use of modeling techniques, will be successful in managing our risks. Accordingly, if the Manager's assumptions are incorrect, the losses that we might incur from an actual catastrophe could be significantly higher than the Manager's expectation of losses generated from modeled catastrophe scenarios and, as a result, our business could be materially and adversely affected.. 27. Table of Contents. The risks associated with property catastrophe reinsurance underwriting could adversely affect us.. Because we participate in property catastrophe reinsurance markets, the success of our underwriting efforts depends, in part, upon the policies, procedures and expertise of the ceding companies making the original underwriting decisions. We face the risk that these ceding companies may fail to accurately assess the risks that they assume initially, which, in turn, may lead us to inaccurately assess the risks we assume. If we fail to establish and receive appropriate premium rates, we could face significant losses on these contracts.. If actual renewals of our existing contracts do not meet expectations, our gross premiums written in future years and our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected.. Our reinsurance contracts are generally for a one-year term. In our financial forecasting process, we make assumptions about the renewal of our prior year's policies and contracts. If actual renewals do not meet expectations, our gross premiums written in future years and our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected. This risk is especially prevalent in the first quarter of each year when a large number of reinsurance contracts are subject to renewal.. The failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ, as well as an unexpected accumulation of attritional losses, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or on our results of operations.. We seek to limit our loss exposure in a variety of ways, including by writing many of our reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis, adhering to maximum limitations on policies written in defined geographical zones, limiting program size for each client, establishing per risk and per occurrence limitations for each event, employing coverage restrictions, following prudent underwriting guidelines for each program written and purchasing retrocessional protection. We seek to limit our loss exposure through geographic diversification. Disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal forum may also arise. As a result, various provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend and some or all of our other loss limitation methods may prove to be ineffective. Underwriting is a matter of judgment, involving important assumptions about matters that are inherently unpredictable and beyond our control, and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not provide sufficient guidance. One or more future catastrophic or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our results of operations, possibly to the extent of eliminating our shareholders' equity.. Our operating results may also be adversely affected by unexpectedly large accumulations of smaller losses. We seek to manage this risk by using appropriate loss limitation methods as noted above. These processes are intended to ensure that premiums received are sufficient to cover the expected levels of attritional loss as well as a contribution to the cost of natural catastrophes and large losses where necessary. It is possible, however, that our loss limitation methods may not work as intended in this respect and that actual losses, including attritional losses, from a class of risks may be greater than expected, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our results of operations.. Profitability may be adversely impacted by inflation.. The effects of inflation could cause the cost of claims from catastrophes or other events to rise in the future. Our reserve for losses and LAE includes assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses. To the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these claims, we will be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified.. Adverse changes to the economies where our clients are located could lower the demand for our reinsurance products and could have a materially adverse effect on the profitability of our operations.. Factors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, inflation, and membership in key economic and political confederations such as the European Union all affect the business and economic environment and, indirectly, the amount and profitability of our business. In an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for insurance products could be adversely affected. Adverse changes in the economy could potentially lead our customers to have less need for reinsurance coverage, to cancel existing reinsurance policies, modify coverage or to not renew with us, and our premium revenue could be adversely affected. Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay premiums as they come due.. 28. Table of Contents. The continuing worldwide economic instability has resulted in global financial market uncertainty and economic instability. Consequently, evolving market conditions may continue to affect our results of operations, financial position and capital resources. In the event that there is further deterioration or volatility in financial markets or general economic conditions, our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity, and competitive landscape could be materially and adversely affected.. As a property reinsurer, we could face losses from terrorism.. We may have substantial exposure to losses resulting from acts of terrorism. It is difficult to predict their occurrence with statistical certainty or to estimate the amount of loss an occurrence will generate. Accordingly, it is possible that our premiums will be inadequate to cover this risk. We closely monitor the amount and types of coverage we provide for terrorism risk under reinsurance treaties. We often seek to exclude terrorism when we cannot reasonably evaluate the risk of loss or charge an appropriate premium for such risk. Even in cases where we have deliberately sought to exclude coverage, we may not be able to eliminate our exposure to terrorist acts, and thus it is possible that these acts will have a material adverse effect on us.. Since we depend on a few brokers for a large portion of our revenues, loss of business provided by any one of them could adversely affect us.. We market our reinsurance worldwide through reinsurance brokers. In the year ended December 31, 2017, our top three brokers represented approximately 84% of our reinsurance premiums written. Loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our business.. We are subject to institutional credit risk that may adversely affect our business because we do business with. institutions such as brokers, banks, custodians and other counterparties.. In the event of the insolvency of the institutions, including brokers, banks, custodians and other counterparties, with which. we do business, or to which our assets have been entrusted, we may be temporarily or permanently deprived of the assets held. by or entrusted to that institution, which may affect our performance.. In accordance with industry practice, we frequently pay amounts owed on claims under our reinsurance contracts to brokers, and these brokers, in turn, pay these amounts to the clients that have purchased reinsurance from us. If a broker fails to make such a payment, in a significant majority of business that we write, it is highly likely that we will be liable to the client for the deficiency because of local laws or contractual obligations, notwithstanding the broker's obligation to make such payment. Likewise, when the client pays premiums for these policies to brokers for payment over to us, these premiums are considered to have been paid and, in most cases, the client will no longer be liable to us for those amounts, whether or not we have actually received the premiums. Consequently, we assume a degree of credit risk associated with brokers around the world with respect to most of our reinsurance business. To date we have not experienced any losses related to such credit risks.. Our investments in insurance-linked contracts subject us to counterparty risk, which could result in substantial losses to us.. While we predominantly enter into fully-collateralized reinsurance contracts, we may, in accordance with our underwriting guidelines and when the Manager identifies suitable opportunities, also invest in other reinsurance-linked investments, including swaps and similar derivative transactions. A swap transaction is an individually negotiated, non-standardized agreement between two parties to exchange cash flows (and sometimes principal amounts) with payments generally calculated by reference to a principal (\"notional\") amount or quantity. These transactions may require that a portion of our assets be held as collateral subject to a perfected security interest in favor of the counterparty. Although pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 swap contracts and similar derivatives may be subject to mandatory centralized trade execution and clearing, not all swap contracts and similar derivatives are subject to these requirements. As a result, we are subject to the risk of the inability or refusal to perform with respect to such contracts on the part of the counterparties with which we trade. Any such failure or refusal, whether due to insolvency, bankruptcy, default or another cause, could subject us to substantial losses.. 29. Table of Contents. We rely on information provided by cedants and brokers in determining whether amounts are due following the occurrence of a covered event, and the Manager may rely on incomplete or unverified information when making investment or underwriting decisions.. The determination of whether amounts are due following the occurrence of a covered event is typically based on reports and may be based upon information provided by cedants, brokers or an independent source, such as an index. In addition, the Manager may rely on imperfect information when making its decisions. The Manager may elect to invest in insurance-linked securities or make an underwriting decision on the basis of information and data filed by the issuer of an instrument or made directly available to the Manager by other sources, for example by a broker. The Manager is not in a position to confirm the completeness, genuineness or accuracy of this information or data. If any of this information or data is incomplete, not genuine or inaccurate, our performance may be adversely affected. In addition, the Manager may not have access to the same information or data or access to the same transactions in which established entities participate, which could adversely affect our business.. The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.. As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either broadening coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our reinsurance contracts may not be known for several years after a contract is issued. For example, an emerging claim and coverage issue is a growing trend of plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers relating to claims-handling practices in the adjustment of losses relating to natural disasters.. We may also be deemed liable for losses arising out of a matter that we had not anticipated or had attempted to contractually exclude. Moreover, irrespective of the clarity and inclusiveness of reinsurance contract language, there can be no assurance that a court or arbitration panel will limit enforceability of reinsurance contract language or not issue a ruling adverse to us. Our exposure to these uncertainties could be exacerbated by the increased willingness of some market participants to dispute reinsurance contract wordings. Alternatively, potential efforts by us to exclude such exposures could, if successful, reduce the market's acceptance of our related products. The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.. The historical cyclicality of the property catastrophe reinsurance industry may cause fluctuations in our results.. Historically, property catastrophe reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to competition, frequency of occurrence or severity of catastrophic events, levels of capacity, general economic conditions and other factors. Demand for reinsurance is influenced significantly by prevailing general economic conditions and, in the case of reinsurance, the underwriting results of primary property and casualty insurers. The supply of reinsurance is related to prevailing prices, the levels of insured losses and the levels of industry surplus which, in turn, may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being earned in the reinsurance industry. As a result, the reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable premium levels. The continued strength of the industry's surplus position and the establishment of new market entrants has increased the supply of reinsurance and has caused reinsurance prices in many of the markets in which we participate to decrease in the past years. Any of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates, less favorable policy terms and fewer submissions for reinsurance coverage. In addition to these considerations, changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and cedants may affect the cycles of the reinsurance business significantly. To the extent these trends continue, our financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.. We operate in a highly competitive environment which could adversely impact our operating margins.. The reinsurance industries are highly competitive. We compete with major U.S. and non-U.S. reinsurers, including other Bermuda-based reinsurers. Many of our competitors have greater financial, marketing and management resources. In addition, we may not be aware of other companies that may be planning to enter the segments of the reinsurance market in which we operate or of existing companies that may be planning to raise additional capital. Increasing competition could result in fewer submissions, lower premium rates and less favorable policy terms and conditions, which could have a material adverse impact on our growth and profitability.. 30. Table of Contents. Insurance/risk-linked securities and derivative and other non-traditional risk transfer mechanisms and vehicles are being developed and offered by other parties, including non-insurance company entities, which could impact the demand for reinsurance. A number of new, proposed or potential industry or legislative developments could further increase competition in our industry. New competition from these developments could cause the demand for reinsurance to fall or the expense of customer acquisition and retention to increase, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our growth and profitability.. Our stated catastrophe and enterprise-wide risk management exposures are based on estimates and judgments which are subject to significant uncertainties.. Our approach to risk management, and our estimates of the net impact from single event losses such as those set forth in Item 7 herein, rely on subjective variables that entail significant uncertainties. For example, in our reinsurance contracts, the effectiveness of our reinsurance contract zonal limits in managing risk depends largely on the degree to which an actual event is confined to the zone in question and on our ability to determine the actual location of the risks insured. Moreover, in the reinsurance contracts we write, the definition of a single occurrence may differ from policy to policy, and the legal interpretation of a policy's various terms and conditions following a catastrophic event may be different from that which we envisioned at its inception. For these and other reasons, there can be no assurance that our actual net aggregate reinsurance treaty limits by zone, or our net impact from single event loss by return period, will not exceed the natural catastrophe risk management tolerances we have established.. In addition, our natural catastrophe risk management involves a substantial number of subjective variables, factors and uncertainties. Small changes in assumptions, which depend heavily on the Manager's and our judgment, can have a significant impact on the modeled outputs. Although we believe that these probabilistic measures provide a meaningful indicator of the relative riskiness of certain events and changes to our business over time, these measures do not predict our actual exposure to, nor guarantee our successful management of, future losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. The Board has approved broad underwriting guidelines for the Manager and neither the Board nor our management will approve each decision made by the Manager.. The Manager is authorized to follow broad guidelines in pursuing our strategy, portfolio execution, risk management and other support services. The Board periodically reviews our guidelines and our portfolio and asset management decisions. They do not, however, review or approve all of our proposed investment decisions or underwriting decisions. In addition, in conducting periodic reviews, our management and the Board rely primarily on information provided to them by the Manager. The Manager has great latitude within the guidelines to determine the types of investments and underwriting decisions it will make on our behalf. Poor decisions by the Manager could have a material adverse effect on our business.. We may change our underwriting guidelines or our strategy without shareholder approval.. The Board has the authority to change our underwriting guidelines or our strategy without notice to shareholders and without shareholder approval. As a result, we may make fundamental changes to our operations without shareholder approval, which could result in our pursuing a strategy or implementing underwriting guidelines that may be materially different from the strategy or underwriting guidelines described in the section titled \"Business\" or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.. OPERATING RISKS. We do not have any employees of our own, and we depend on service providers to perform substantially all of our executive, administrative and other functions, and termination of any of these relationships may materially disrupt our business.. We do not have any employees of our own. Our CEO and our CFO are employees of Sompo International and their services are provided to us through the Investment Management Agreement and Administrative Services Agreement.. Our CEO is the President and CEO of the Manager and does not dedicate all of his time to running our business and is not required to dedicate any specific amount of time to running our business. As a result of his other obligations, our CEO may not be able to dedicate as much time to running our business as would a typical CEO, and he may face conflicts of interest that may make it difficult for him to operate our business.. 31. Table of Contents. Our CFO also serves as the Controller and Vice President of Sompo International and is the Treasurer of the Manager, and, therefore, does not dedicate all of his time to running our business and is not required to dedicate any specific amount of time to running our business. As a result of his other obligations, our CFO is not able to dedicate as much time to running our business as would a typical CFO, and he may face conflicts of interest that may make it difficult for him to operate our business.. We rely on service providers to perform many of our executive, administrative and other functions. In particular, affiliates of Sompo International provide us with accounting, legal, internal audit, administrative and other services that are integral to our day-to-day operations. Failure by any service provider, whether or not an affiliate of Sompo International, to carry out its obligations to us in accordance with the terms of its agreement or to perform its obligations to us as a result of insolvency, bankruptcy or other causes could make it difficult, or in some cases impossible, for us to operate our business. In addition, the termination of any of these service relationships or any delay in appointing or finding a suitable replacement provider (if one exists) could make it difficult for us to operate our business.. Our Chairman, CEO, CFO and the officers of the Manager are compensated by Sompo International.. Our Chairman, CEO, CFO and the officers of the Manager are employees of Sompo International and are compensated by Sompo International, including through membership in Sompo International's incentive compensation plans. As a result, they may, consciously or unconsciously, favor Sompo International in dealings among us, Sompo International and the Manager.. Reputation is an important factor in the reinsurance industry, and our lack of an established reputation may make it difficult for us to attract or retain clients.. Reputation is a very important factor in the reinsurance industry, and competition for clients is, in part, based on reputation. Our lack of an established reputation may make it difficult for us to attract or retain clients. While some counterparties may prefer to enter into reinsurance contracts with a rated reinsurer, we do not intend to obtain financial strength ratings. We do not own the Blue Capital® trademark, but we have entered into a trademark license agreement with Sompo International providing for the license of the Blue Capital® trademark to us. We will consequently be unable to prevent any damage to our reputation that may occur as a result of the activities of Sompo International and others. Furthermore, in the event that any of the Investment Management Agreement, the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement or the Administrative Services Agreement is terminated, or the trademark license agreement is otherwise terminated, we may be unable to use the Blue Capital® trademark.. We rely on the Manager for services that are essential to the operation of our business, and the loss of the Manager would make it difficult to operate our business.. The Manager manages our assets, subject to our underwriting guidelines and the oversight of the Board. Because we have no full-time employees, we are not able to manage our assets without the benefit of the services of the Manager, which has significant discretion as to the management of such assets.. The Manager provides underwriting services to Blue Capital Re, including underwriting decisions, loss control, exposure management and modeling and statistical, claims, actuarial and administrative support services. Because we do not have any employees of our own, we cannot implement our underwriting strategy without the benefit of these services, and the Manager has significant discretion as to our underwriting practices, within the broad scope of our underwriting guidelines and the oversight of the Board. We are also dependent on the Manager to accurately price the risks underwritten on its behalf pursuant to the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement in order to meet our financial goals.. In the event that these services were to cease to be available from the Manager, we would be required to replace the Manager with one or more third-parties or to hire employees. In addition, the performance of the Manager depends heavily on the experience and availability of a limited number of individuals, all of whom are affiliated with Sompo International. Any loss of these individuals, for example, to death, incapacity, termination or resignation, could adversely affect the performance of the Manager. We cannot assure you that we could find a suitable replacement for the Manager quickly or at all, and any replacement may increase our expenses. The loss of the Manager could materially impair our ability to successfully operate our business.. 32. Table of Contents. We are dependent on Sompo International and if Sompo International were to experience difficulties, we could be materially adversely affected.. Since the Manager is an affiliate of Sompo International, and our CEO and CFO are both employees of Sompo International, if Sompo International's business were to experience difficulties, the attention and time of Sompo International's management would likely be directed to dealing with those difficulties. In these circumstances, there may not be sufficient management attention to our business, and our operations could suffer. In addition, in that event it is also possible that ceding companies would be reluctant to do business with Sompo International, and therefore us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. It may be difficult, costly or time-consuming to replace the Manager or the other services Sompo International provides.. We compete with the Manager's other accounts for access to its services.. The Manager manages multiple accounts with focuses that may overlap to a greater or lesser extent with our strategy, and the Manager expects to continue to do so in the future. The Manager is not restricted in any way from sponsoring or accepting business or capital from new clients, insurance companies, funds or other accounts, including businesses that are similar to, or that overlap with, our business. Therefore, we compete with other sources of capital for access to the time and attention of the Manager. For the same reasons, the personnel of the Manager dedicate a substantial portion of their time and attention to managing third-party assets.. We compete with Sompo International accounts, accounts affiliated with Sompo International and third-parties for underwriting opportunities and other opportunities.. Many, if not most, of our targeted underwriting and other opportunities are also opportunities targeted to a greater or lesser extent by Sompo International, affiliates of Sompo International and other accounts of the Manager. The Manager is not required to allocate any or all such opportunities to us. The Manager makes available to us opportunities to enter into reinsurance transactions, purchase insurance-linked securities and make investments that it determines are appropriate for us in accordance with its allocation policies and our underwriting guidelines. The Manager has significant discretion as to our investment and underwriting practices, subject to our underwriting guidelines and the oversight of the Board. We expect that the Manager will primarily allocate any overlapping opportunities on a proportional basis among the various accounts that it manages.. There may be conflicts of interest that result from our relationships with Sompo International and the Manager, which could result in decisions that are not in the best interests of our shareholders.. There may be conflicts of interest that arise out of our relationship with Sompo International and the Manager. One of our directors is also a director of Blue Capital Alternative Income Fund Limited, a closed-ended mutual fund which is also served by the Manager. Our Chairman, CEO and CFO are also employees of Sompo International. In addition, the Manager is wholly-owned by Sompo International. As a result, our officers, our directors or the Manager may have conflicts between their duties to us and their duties to, and interests in, Sompo International or other parties.. Pursuant to the BW Retrocessional Agreement we participate in retrocessional, quota share and fronting agreements with Sompo International or its affiliates, and we may enter into other agreements or acquire investments in which Sompo International or its affiliates have an interest. These transactions may present conflicts of interest among us and Sompo International.. In deciding whether to issue debt or equity securities, we rely in part on recommendations made to us by the Manager. Because the Manager earns fees that are closely related to the total amount of our earnings and capital, the Manager may have an incentive to recommend that we issue debt or equity securities.. The officers and employees of the Manager devote as much time to us as the Manager deems appropriate. However, these officers and employees may have conflicts in allocating their time and services among us, Sompo International, affiliates of Sompo International and other accounts. During turbulent conditions in the reinsurance industry or other times when we need focused support and assistance from the Manager, Sompo International and entities affiliated with Sompo International will likewise require greater focus and attention, placing the Manager's time and resources in high demand. In this situation, we may not receive the support and assistance we require or would otherwise receive if we were completely internally managed or if the Manager did not act as a manager for other entities. Although we believe the Manager has established appropriate procedures to manage any actual or potential conflicts of interest, these procedures do not provide assurance that such conflicts will be avoided.. 33. Table of Contents. We may not be able to hedge our risk effectively, if at all, which may adversely affect our performance.. Although we seek to mitigate our loss exposure through a variety of methods, property catastrophe reinsurance risk is inherently unpredictable. It is difficult to predict the timing, frequency and severity of loss events with statistical certainty or estimate the amount of loss any given occurrence will generate. It is not possible to completely eliminate our exposure to unforecasted or unpredictable events and, to the extent that losses from such risks occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.. In the reinsurance market, hedging refers to the process of reducing the risk assumed by the reinsurer by employing various insurance-linked securities or otherwise. We may, but are not obligated to, hedge our assumed risks. The success of our hedging strategy, if any, will depend, in part, upon the Manager's ability to assess correctly the degree of correlation between the performance of the instruments used in the hedging strategy and the performance of the contracts being hedged. Since the characteristics of hedging instruments may change as markets change or time passes, the success of our hedging strategy, if any, will also be subject to the Manager's ability to continually recalculate, readjust and execute hedges in an efficient and timely manner. While we may enter into hedging transactions in order to reduce risk, hedging transactions may result in a poorer overall performance than if we had not engaged in hedging transactions. For a variety of reasons, the Manager may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between the hedging instruments utilized and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Such an imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge or expose us to risk of loss. The successful utilization of hedging and risk management transactions requires skills complementary to those needed in the selection of our portfolio. We cannot assure you that the Manager can hedge our risk effectively or that the hedging strategy that it does employ, if any, will be effective.. Part of the Manager's compensation is calculated by reference to our performance, which may create an incentive for the Manager to pursue a riskier or more speculative strategy.. The Manager's compensation is, in part, calculated by reference to our performance. In particular, the Performance Fee payable to the Manager under the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement may create an incentive for the Manager to pursue a riskier or more speculative strategy than would be the case in the absence of the Performance Fees. Pursuing this riskier or more speculative strategy may result in losses that could adversely affect our business.. Neither the Investment Management Agreement nor the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement was negotiated between unaffiliated third-parties, and these agreements may not be as favorable to us as if they had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third-party and may be costly and difficult to terminate.. The Investment Management Agreement that we have entered into with the Manager was negotiated between related parties, and although approved by the Board, its terms, including fees payable, may not be as favorable to us as if this agreement had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third-party. Various potential and actual conflicts of interest may arise from the activities of the Manager by virtue of the fact that the Manager is controlled by Sompo International.. Similarly, the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement that we and Blue Capital Re have entered into with the Manager was negotiated between related parties, and although approved by the Board, its terms, including fees payable, may not be as favorable to us as if it had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third-party. Various potential and actual conflicts of interest may arise from the activities of the Manager by virtue of the fact that the Manager is controlled by Sompo International. The Manager does not assume any responsibility other than provision of the services called for under the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement.. We generally may not terminate either the Investment Management Agreement or the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement until the fifth anniversary of the completion of the IPO, whether or not the Manager's performance is satisfactory, and under certain circumstances we will have to pay a termination fee if either the Investment Management Agreement or the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement is terminated or not renewed. We may not amend or modify any provision of either the Investment Management Agreement or the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement without the prior written consent of the Manager.. Under both the terms of the Investment Management Agreement and the terms of the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement, the Manager (and any person to whom the Manager has delegated or sub-contracted any of its functions) will not be liable for any losses except to the extent such losses are determined to be the direct result of an act or omission of the Manager that constitutes gross negligence, fraud, dishonesty or willful misconduct of the Manager.. 34. Table of Contents. In addition, we generally must indemnify the Manager and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and permitted assigns for, from and against losses: (i) arising out of or relating to any demand, charge or claim in respect of acts, omissions, transactions, duties, obligations or responsibilities; or (ii) arising out of any acts or omissions by us arising out of the Investment Management Agreement or the Underwriting and Insurance Management Agreement, as applicable, of the Manager and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and permitted assigns.. As a Bermuda company, we may be unable to attract and retain employees.. We do not have any employees of our own. If we were to hire any employees in the future, they would likely be employed in Bermuda. We also rely on services from other Bermuda companies, including the Manager. It may be difficult for us or the Manager to attract and retain experienced personnel in Bermuda, particularly if we are unable to secure Bermuda work permits for our personnel or if the Manager's personnel are unable to secure Bermuda work permits. In addition, Bermuda is a highly competitive location for qualified staff, especially in the reinsurance and insurance industry, making it harder to attract and retain employees. As our success depends on our, and the Manager's, ability to hire and retain personnel, any future difficulties in hiring or retaining personnel in Bermuda or elsewhere could adversely affect our business.. The Company is dependent upon dividends and distributions from its subsidiaries, and it may be unable to distribute dividends to its shareholders to the extent it does not receive such amounts from its subsidiaries.. The Company has no operations of its own and relies on dividends and distributions from its subsidiaries to pay its operating expenses, amounts owed under the 2016 Credit Facility and dividends to its shareholders. Furthermore, Blue Capital Re is regulated by the BMA, and the ability of Blue Capital Re to pay dividends and make distributions to the Company is limited under Bermuda law and regulations.. The Companies Act also limits the Company's, Blue Capital Re's and Blue Capital Re ILS' ability to pay dividends and make distributions to their respective shareholders. None of the Company, Blue Capital Re or Blue Capital Re ILS is permitted to declare or pay a dividend, or make a distribution out of contributed surplus, if it is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due, or if the realizable value of its assets would be less than its liabilities. See \"Regulation and Capital Requirements\" for more information.. The Company cannot assure you that it will declare or pay future dividends on its Common Shares or repurchase its Common Shares.. Although the Company intends to distribute a minimum of 90% of its annual Distributable Income to shareholders, it cannot assure you that it will declare or pay any dividends at this level or at all or repurchase any Common Shares. Any determination to declare or pay future dividends to the Company's shareholders or repurchase Common Shares will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend on a variety of factors, including: (i) the Company's financial condition, liquidity, results of operations (including its ability to generate cash flow in excess of its expenses and its expected or actual net income) and collateral and capital requirements; (ii) general business conditions; (iii) legal, tax and regulatory limitations; (iv) contractual prohibitions and other restrictions; and (v) any other factors that the Board deems relevant.. Operational risks, including the risk of fraud and any errors and omissions, are inherent in our business and could have a material adverse impact on our business or results of operations.. Operational risks that are inherent in our business can result in financial losses, including those resulting from fraud or errors and omissions by any employees or by our third-party service providers, including the Manager. Although we believe that we have established appropriate controls and mitigation procedures to prevent significant fraud, errors and omissions and other potential irregularities from occurring, these controls and procedures do not provide absolute assurance as to the absence and mitigation of these risks.. Technology breaches or failures, including, but not limited to, those resulting from a malicious cyber attack on us, the Manager or our third-party service providers, could disrupt or otherwise negatively impact our business.. We, the Manager and our third-party service providers rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, store and protect the electronic information, financial data and proprietary models that are critical to our business. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communications between us, the Manager and our third-party service providers depends upon information technology and electronic information exchange. The information technology systems of the Manager and our third-party service providers are vulnerable to data breaches, interruptions or failures due to events that may be beyond their. 35. Table of Contents. control, including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, theft, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, hackers and general technology failures.. Any information technology systems that we may develop in the future would also be vulnerable to these same risks. Despite safeguards we and our service providers may take to protect the information systems that we rely on, disruptions to and breaches of such information technology systems are possible and may negatively impact our business, including our reputation in the insurance and reinsurance marketplace.. It is possible that insurance policies we have in place would not entirely protect us in the event that we were to experience a breach, interruption or widespread failure of the information technology systems we rely on. Furthermore, we have not secured insurance coverage designed to specifically protect us from an economic loss resulting from such an event.. Although we have never experienced any known or threatened cases involving unauthorized access to the information technology systems we rely on or unauthorized appropriation of our data contained within such systems, we cannot assure you that such technology breaches will not occur in the future.. We cannot assure you that we will attain our financial goals.. Our business and results of operations are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will attain our financial goals. Failure to achieve our financial goals may make an investment in our Common Shares unattractive to some investors and may cause our Common Shares to trade at lower prices than those of comparable companies that successfully attain their financial goals.. We primarily enter into fully-collateralized reinsurance contracts and, as a result, our capacity for entering into reinsurance contracts or other investments is limited by our equity capital, and we are only able to redeploy that capital in future periods after it is released from the prior collateral trust account.. Blue Capital Re is not currently, and may never become, a rated reinsurer, nor does it intend to obtain financial strength ratings. As a result, the reinsurance contracts that Blue Capital Re assumes are required to be fully-collateralized. The requirement to post cash collateral in connection with the various insurance contracts that we enter into limits our ability to enter into a large number of insurance contracts or pursue other opportunities. Furthermore, our ability to redeploy our capital annually can be impacted if the release of our collateral is not agreed to by our counterparties or if a loss event occurs, in which case the collateral pledged against the affected contract will not be available for redeployment until the loss is cleared. In addition, if our equity capital decreases over time, as a result of losses, expenses or other factors, we will be even more restricted in the number of contracts we can enter into and other opportunities we can pursue. As a result, our portfolio of insurance-linked contracts and other investments may be significantly less diverse than those of Sompo International or other reinsurance companies.. Some of the insurance-linked securities in which we may transact business have limited or no secondary markets, and this illiquidity may require us to realize assets below fair value.. There may not be an active market for some of the insurance-linked securities in which we may transact business, such as catastrophe bonds and industry loss warranties. As a result, it may require substantial time or may be difficult to sell any of these securities at fair value, and we may only be able to sell these securities below fair value.. Changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements may materially impact our reported financial results.. Unanticipated developments in accounting practices may require us to incur considerable additional expenses to comply with such developments, particularly if it is required to prepare information relating to prior periods for comparative purposes or to apply the new requirements retroactively. The impact of changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements cannot be predicted but may affect the calculation of net income, net equity, and other relevant financial statement line items.. 36. Table of Contents. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, including those relating to accounting standards and disclosure about our executive compensation, that apply to other public companies.. We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act. We have taken advantage of, and we plan in future filings with the SEC to continue to take advantage of, certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and of shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We do not know if some investors will find our Common Shares less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of certain of these exemptions. The result may be a less active trading market for our Common Shares and our share price may be more volatile.. We intend to continue to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (i) the last day of the year during which we had total annual gross revenues of at least $1.0 billion (as indexed for inflation); (ii) December 31, 2018; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \"large accelerated filer,\" as defined under the Exchange Act.. Failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Sarbanes-Oxley could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price.. As a public company with SEC reporting obligations, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures to satisfy the requirements of Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley, which require annual assessments by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We are an emerging growth company, and thus we are exempt from the auditors' attestation requirement of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley until such time as we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. Regardless of whether we qualify as an emerging growth company, we still need to implement substantial control systems and procedures in order to satisfy the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act and applicable requirements, among other items.. During the course of our assessment, we may identify deficiencies that we are unable to remediate in a timely manner. Testing and maintaining our internal control over financial reporting may also divert management's attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. We may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley. If we conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and remediation actions or its effect on our operations because there is presently no precedent available by which to measure compliance adequacy. Moreover, any material weakness or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting may impede our ability to file timely and accurate reports with the SEC. Any of the above could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information or our common share listing on the New York Stock Exchange to be suspended or terminated, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our shares.. Our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period and may not be indicative of our long-term prospects.. Our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period. These fluctuations result from a variety of factors, including the seasonality of the reinsurance business, the volume and mix of reinsurance products that we write, loss experience on our reinsurance liabilities and our ability to assess and integrate our risk management strategy effectively. In particular, we seek to underwrite products to achieve long-term results. As a result, our short-term results of operations may not be indicative of our long-term prospects.. If actual claims exceed our reserve for losses and LAE, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.. Our success depends upon our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses that we reinsure. We establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all losses and LAE incurred with respect to premiums earned on the policies that we write. Loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, our loss and LAE reserves are estimates of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost. These estimates are based upon actuarial and statistical projections and on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of future. 37. Table of Contents. trends in claims severity and frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. Loss reserve estimates are refined continually in an ongoing process as experience develops and claims are reported and settled. Establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process. Moreover, these uncertainties are greater for companies like us than for those with a longer operating history because we do not yet have an extensive loss history. Because of this uncertainty, it is possible that our reserves at any given time will prove inadequate.. To the extent we determine that actual losses and LAE exceed our expectations and loss reserves recorded in our financial statements, we will be required to increase our reserve for losses and LAE. This could cause a material reduction in our profitability and capital.. We are subject to loss settlements made by ceding companies and fronting carriers, which could materially adversely affect our performance.. Where Blue Capital Re enters into reinsurance contracts, all loss settlements made by a ceding company, provided they are within the terms of the underlying policies and within the terms of the relevant contract, will be unconditionally binding upon us. While we believe that the ceding companies will settle such claims in good faith, we are bound to accept the claims settlements agreed to by the ceding companies. Under the underlying policies, each ceding company bears the burden of proving that a contractual exclusion applies to a loss, and there may be circumstances where the facts of a loss are insufficient to support the application of an exclusion. In such circumstances, we assume such losses under the reinsured policies, which could materially adversely affect our performance.. Operational risks, including systems or human failures, are inherent in business, including ours, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. We are subject to operational risks including fraud, employee errors, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization, failure to comply with regulatory requirements or obligations under our agreements, information technology failures, or external events. Losses from these risks may occur from time to time and may be significant. As our business and operations grow more complex, we are exposed to more risk in these areas.. The Manager's modeling, underwriting and information technology systems are critical to our success. Moreover, their proprietary technology and application systems have been an important part of our underwriting strategy and our ability to compete successfully. They have also licensed certain systems and data from third parties. We cannot be certain that they will have access to these, or comparable, service providers, or that our information technology or application systems will continue to operate as intended. While we and our Manager has implemented disaster recovery and other business continuity plans, a defect or failure in our internal controls or information technology systems could result in reduced or delayed revenue growth, higher than expected losses, management distraction, or harm to our operations and/or our reputation. We believe appropriate controls and mitigation procedures are in place to prevent significant risk of defect in our internal controls and information technology systems, but internal controls provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance as to the absence of errors or irregularities and any ineffectiveness of such controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business.. Our success depends on our ability to raise additional capital in the future, which we may not be able to do successfully or on favorable terms.. The success of our business depends on raising sufficient capital to use in writing additional reinsurance and over which we can spread our costs. Unless we are able to write additional reinsurance and spread our costs over additional capital, we may not be profitable at all or our profitability may be adversely affected. We cannot estimate with any certainty how much additional capital we may need to be profitable. Although we intend to raise additional capital, we cannot assure you that our attempts to do so will be successful.. Any new debt, equity or hybrid financial instruments issued might contain terms and conditions that are unfavorable to our existing shareholders. Any new issuances of equity or hybrid securities could include the issuance of securities with rights, preferences and privileges that are senior or otherwise superior to those of our Common Shares. Any new issuance could be dilutive to our existing shareholders or cause the value of our Common Shares to decline. Any new debt may substantially increase our leverage, could expose us to an increased risk of loss and may contain terms that materially restrict our operations, including our ability to distribute cash to our shareholders. Additional capital raised through the issuance of debt may result in creditors having rights, preferences and privileges senior or otherwise superior to those of an existing shareholder. In addition, if we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms, or at all, our business could be adversely affected.. 38. Table of Contents. LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS. Recent or future legislation may decrease the demand for our property catastrophe reinsurance products and adversely affect our business and results of operations.. It is possible that U.S. states, particularly those with Atlantic or Gulf Coast exposures, may enact new or expanded legislation establishing further state involvement in providing or governing the reinsurance of catastrophe exposed risks, or may otherwise enact legislation, that might further diminish aggregate private market demand for our products. Alternatively, legislation adversely impacting the private markets could be enacted on a regional or at the Federal level. Moreover, we believe that numerous modeled potential catastrophes could exceed the actual or politically acceptable bonded capacity of one or more of the catastrophe funds established by U.S. states, which could lead either to a severe dislocation or the necessity of Federal intervention in the markets of one or more of those states, either of which would adversely impact the private reinsurance industry.. The regulatory system under which we operate, and potential changes thereto, including heightened scrutiny of issues and practices in the insurance industry could have a material adverse effect on our business.. The laws and regulations under which we operate could be revised in a manner materially adverse to the way in which we conduct our business.. The reinsurance regulatory framework continues to be subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions, including the U.S. and various states within the U.S. It is possible such scrutiny, such as the expansion of the regulatory scope of the U.S. Federal Insurance Office, the repeal of the insurance company antitrust exemption under the McCarran Ferguson Act or the expansion of the European Union Solvency II requirements, could include us and it is also possible that investigations or related regulatory developments could mandate or otherwise give rise to changes in industry practices in a fashion that increases our costs or requires us to alter how we conduct our business. In addition, if our Bermuda reinsurance operations become subject to the insurance laws of any state in the U.S., we could face inquiries or challenges to the future operations of these companies.. Blue Capital Re may not be able to obtain or maintain necessary licenses, permits, authorizations or accreditations, or may be able to do so only at great cost. In addition, we may not be able to comply fully with, or obtain appropriate exemptions from, the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to reinsurance companies or holding companies. Failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate exemptions under any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate and fines and other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may impact the operations of our insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries and ultimately could impact our financial condition as well. In addition, we could be adversely affected if a regulatory authority believed we had failed to comply with applicable law or regulation. Despite our efforts to maintain effective compliance procedures, there is a risk that applicable laws and regulations may be unclear, subject to multiple interpretations, under development or may conflict with one another, that regulators may revise their previous guidance or that courts overturn previous rulings, or that we could otherwise fail to meet the applicable standards.. Regulation may restrict our ability to operate and may restrict the ability of other reinsurers with which we do business to operate, which may adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy.. Reinsurance operations are subject to extensive regulation. Governmental agencies have broad administrative power to regulate many aspects of the reinsurance business, which may include premium rates, marketing practices, advertising, policy forms and capital adequacy. These governmental agencies are concerned primarily with the protection of policyholders to the exclusion of other constituencies, including shareholders of insurers and reinsurers. Insurance laws and regulations can impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments, prescribe solvency standards that must be met and maintained, and require the maintenance of reserves. Changes in laws and regulations may restrict our ability to operate our current business or may have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Unexpected events, such as natural and man-made disasters or terrorist attacks, could lead to government intervention that affects the insurance and reinsurance markets. It may be difficult for us or the other reinsurers with which we do business to predict the exact nature, timing or scope of possible governmental initiatives. Governmental regulation and intervention could adversely affect our business and the business of other reinsurers with which we do business by:. 39. Table of Contents.  providing insurance and reinsurance capacity in markets and to consumers that we or the reinsurers with which we do business target;.  requiring us or the ceding companies with which we do business to participate in industry pools and guaranty associations;.  expanding the scope of coverage under existing policies;.  regulating the terms of insurance and reinsurance policies; or.  disproportionately benefiting the companies of one country over those of another.. Our industry is also affected by political, judicial and legal developments that may create new and expanded theories of liability. These changes may result in delays or cancellations of products and services by insurers and reinsurers, which could adversely affect us or the ceding companies with which we do business. If, as a result of governmental regulation or intervention, the ceding companies with which we do business, including Blue Water Re and Sompo International, are adversely affected, this may limit our opportunity to do business with these reinsurers, including by way of writing retrocessional policies.. We are not currently subject to group supervision, but the BMA may exercise its authority to act as group supervisor in the future if we form overseas entities. We are not planning on forming overseas entities in the foreseeable future. See \"Regulation and Capital Requirements\" contained in Item 1 herein for more information.. Solvency II could adversely impact our financial results and operations.. Solvency II, a European Union directive concerning capital adequacy, risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers, which was adopted by the European Parliament in April of 2009, and which came into effect on January 1, 2016, may adversely affect our reinsurance business. We continue to monitor the ongoing legislative and regulatory steps following adoption of Solvency II and Bermuda gaining full Solvency II equivalence. The principles, standards and requirements of Solvency II may, directly or indirectly, impact the future supervision of our operating subsidiaries.. Blue Capital Re is subject to regulation that may make it more difficult to operate our business.. Our subsidiary, Blue Capital Re, is registered as a Class 3A insurer. As a result, it is subject to regulation and supervision in Bermuda. Bermuda insurance statutes and regulations and policies of the BMA require Blue Capital Re to, among other things:.  maintain a fixed level of capital;.  maintain a minimum solvency margin valued at $1.0 million at all times;.  restrict dividends and distributions;.  obtain prior approval of ownership and transfer of shares;.  maintain a head office in Bermuda;.  maintain a principal office and appoint and maintain a principal representative in Bermuda; and.  provide for the performance of certain periodic examinations of Blue Capital Re and its financial condition.. Furthermore, Blue Capital Re may only enter into contracts of reinsurance that are fully-collateralized and each transaction that it undertakes must be consistent with its original business plan filed with BMA at the time of Blue Capital Re's registration.. These statutes, requirements and regulations may, in effect, restrict our ability to write reinsurance policies, to distribute funds and to pursue our underwriting strategy.. Blue Capital Re is licensed as a reinsurer only in Bermuda, and it does not plan to seek licenses in any other jurisdiction. The suspension or revocation of Blue Capital Re's license to do business as a reinsurance company in Bermuda for any reason would mean that it would not be able to enter into any new reinsurance contracts until the suspension ended or Blue Capital Re became licensed in another jurisdiction. Any such suspension or revocation of Blue Capital Re's license would negatively impact our reputation in the reinsurance marketplace and could have a material adverse effect on our business.. The process of obtaining licenses can be very time consuming and costly, and we may not be able to become licensed in a jurisdiction other than Bermuda should we choose to do so. The modification of the conduct of our business resulting from our becoming licensed in certain jurisdictions could significantly and negatively affect our business. In addition, our inability to. 40. Table of Contents. comply with insurance statutes and regulations could significantly and adversely affect our business by limiting our ability to conduct business as well as by subjecting us to penalties and fines.. The BMA could revoke or suspend Blue Capital Re's license in certain circumstances, including circumstances in which: (i) it is shown that false, misleading or inaccurate information has been supplied to the BMA by Blue Capital Re or on its behalf for the purposes of any provision of the Insurance Act; (ii) we have ceased to carry on business; (iii) Blue Capital Re has persistently failed to pay fees due under the Insurance Act; (iv) Blue Capital Re has been shown to have not complied with a condition attached to its registration or with a requirement made of us under the Insurance Act; (v) we are convicted of an offense against a provision of the Insurance Act; (vi) Blue Capital Re is, in the opinion of the BMA, found not to have been carrying on business in accordance with sound insurance principles; or (vii) any of the minimum criteria for registration under the Insurance Act is not or will not have been fulfilled. If the BMA suspended or revoked Blue Capital Re's license, we could lose our exemption under the Investment Company Act.. Any suspension or revocation of Blue Capital Re's reinsurance license would materially impact our ability to do business and implement our business strategy.. Insurance supervisors in the U.S. or elsewhere may review our activities and assert that we are subject to additional licensing requirements.. As a Class 3A Bermuda insurer registered under the Insurance Act, Blue Capital Re is subject to regulation and supervision in Bermuda. We do not presently expect that we will be admitted to do business in any jurisdiction other than Bermuda. In general, Bermuda insurance statutes, regulations and the policies of the BMA differ from U.S. insurance statutes and regulations. We cannot assure you that insurance supervisors in the U.S. or elsewhere will not review our activities and assert that we are subject to such jurisdiction's licensing requirements. In addition, we may be subject to indirect regulatory requirements imposed by jurisdictions that may limit our ability to provide reinsurance. For example, our ability to write reinsurance may be subject, in certain cases, to arrangements satisfactory to applicable supervisory bodies, and proposed legislation and regulations may have the effect of imposing additional requirements upon, or restricting the market for, non-U.S. reinsurers such as us.. If in the future we were to become subject to regulation under the laws of any state in the U.S. or the laws of the U.S. or of any other country, we may consider various alternatives to our operations. If we attempt to become licensed in another jurisdiction, for instance, we may not be able to do so and the modification of the conduct of our business or the non-compliance with insurance statutes and regulations could significantly and negatively affect our business.. Sompo International may not maintain an acceptable financial strength rating, which could result in a significant reduction in the business we write pursuant to the BW Retrocessional Agreement.. Pursuant to our underwriting guidelines, we may enter into fronting agreements with a rated carrier or, alternatively, we may access fronted business from Sompo International pursuant to the BW Retrocessional Agreement. Under these fronting arrangements, the rated carrier transfers all risks and premiums to us in exchange for a fronting fee.. Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies. A fronting company's financial strength rating is subject to periodic review by, and may be revised downward or revoked at the sole discretion of, the applicable rating agency in response to a variety of factors. If Sompo International's financial strength rating is reduced from its current level, it would reduce the attractiveness of one means by which we can access exposure to reinsurance risk from that counterparty. While we and Blue Water Re have been informed by Sompo International that it is not aware of any pending or contemplated ratings downgrade of Sompo International, such a downgrade remains possible and could result in a significant reduction in the number of reinsurance contracts that we are able to write, unless another fronting reinsurer of an acceptable financial strength rating was available to us.. We are subject to the risk of being treated as an investment company under U.S. federal securities law, which may cause us to fundamentally restructure our business or potentially to cease operations.. The Investment Company Act contains registration requirements and a pervasive regulatory scheme that applies to companies that fall within the definition of \"investment company\" under that statute, and that do not have any available exception or exemption. We believe that we have available to us one or more exceptions or exemptions from the definition of investment company, including the exemption that is available to a company organized and regulated as a foreign insurance company (which must be engaged primarily and predominantly in the business of insurance or reinsurance). Although we are engaged primarily and predominantly in the reinsurance business, and we intend to conduct our business on an ongoing basis. 41. Table of Contents. so that we remain engaged primarily and predominantly in the reinsurance business, our investments in some insurance-related assets may or may not be considered part of the reinsurance business for Investment Company Act purposes, even though we view these investments as part of our reinsurance business. Nonetheless, because our investments in these insurance-related assets are not the primary component of our business, we expect that we will still be engaged primarily and predominantly in the reinsurance business even if these insurance-related assets are not considered part of the reinsurance business for Investment Company Act purposes.. We are not, and do not intend to become, registered as an investment company under U.S. federal securities law.. The Investment Company Act regulates certain companies that invest in or trade securities. The Investment Company Act protects investors by, among other things, imposing restrictions on the ability of a registered investment company's affiliates to engage in transactions with the company, and imposing requirements on the capital structure of a registered investment company, the custody of its assets and the composition of its board of directors. We are not registered, and we do not intend to register, as an investment company under the Investment Company Act; therefore, you will not benefit from the protections of the Investment Company Act.. If, as a result of our operations, we were deemed an \"investment company,\" and are not otherwise exempted from the definition, we would either have to seek to register under the Investment Company Act as an investment company or fundamentally restructure our business or cease operations. Since we are organized outside of the U.S., we could not register as an investment company without first applying for and obtaining an order of the SEC permitting us to do so. These orders have been granted very infrequently. Registered investment companies are subject to extensive and restrictive regulation that can adversely affect businesses like ours. Accordingly, if we were to register as an investment company after obtaining an order permitting us to do so, we would not be able to operate our business as we currently conduct it. If we decided not to register under the Investment Company Act or if we were unable to register under the Investment Company Act, we would have to fundamentally restructure our business or cease operations.. If at any time it were established that we had been operating as an investment company in violation of the Investment Company Act, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, that we would be subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both.. The referendum vote by the United Kingdom in favor of leaving the European Union could adversely affect our business.. The United Kingdom held a referendum on June 23, 2016, in which a majority voted for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. As a result of this vote, negotiations have commenced to determine the terms of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, as well as its relationship with the European Union going forward (\"Brexit\"). Brexit has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rates, which could increase the volatility of, or reduce the Company's results in particular periods or over time. Higher levels of political and market turmoil could persist until some clarity emerges around the United Kingdom's exit process from the European Union and the impact of Brexit on the economies of the other European countries. The geopolitical impacts of Brexit are unknown and may adversely affect long-term European and global economic growth and forecasts, which could adversely impact the demand for the Company's products. Brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and differing laws and regulations between the United Kingdom and the European Union. These uncertainties could affect the operations, strategic position or results of brokers, insurers or reinsurers with whom the Company does business. Any of these potential effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.. CORPORATE RISKS. Sompo International has substantial control over us, which limits your ability to influence corporate matters and may result in conflicts of interest.. Sompo International currently has a 33.2% interest in the Company and therefore exerts considerable influence over matters presented to our shareholders for approval, including the election of directors and change of control transactions. Sompo International has the right to nominate two out of our five directors (or, if the Board consists of more than five directors, no less than 40% of the total Board seats at any given time), until the later of the date on which: (i) Sompo International sells any of its Common Shares; and (ii) Sompo International owns less than 5% of our Common Shares. This control may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by our other shareholders, as the interests of Sompo International may not always coincide with the interests of our other shareholders. In particular, Sompo International has interests in us by virtue of our contracts with the Manager (see \"Conflicts of Interest\" contained in Item 1 herein for a description of these contracts). Sompo International. 42. Table of Contents. may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in its judgment, could enhance its interests or its investment in us, but which might involve risks to our other shareholders or adversely affect us or our other shareholders. In addition, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our Common Shares because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with a significant shareholder.. Future sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our Common Shares may depress the price of our shares.. Sompo International currently owns 2,912,458 Common Shares, representing 33.2% of our total outstanding Common Shares. These Common Shares may be sold into the market in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act. In addition, Sompo International has the ability to require us to register the Common Shares it holds pursuant to a shareholder and registration rights agreement.. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or sales of our Common Shares or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our Common Shares will have on the market price of our Common Shares. Issuances or sales of substantial amounts of our Common Shares, or the perception that such issuances or sales could occur, may adversely affect the prevailing market price for our Common Shares.. Our bye-laws and provisions of Bermuda law may impede or discourage a change of control transaction, which could deprive our investors of the opportunity to receive a premium for their Common Shares.. Our bye-laws and provisions of Bermuda law to which we are subject contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent \"change of control\" transactions or changes in the Board and management that certain shareholders may view as beneficial or advantageous. These provisions include, among others:.  the Board is divided into three classes, with each class serving for a staggered three-year term, which prevents shareholders from electing an entirely new board of directors at an annual meeting;.  the total voting power of any U.S. person owning more than 9.5% of our Common Shares will be reduced to no more than 9.5% of the total voting power of our Common Shares;.  the Board has the authority to issue preferred shares without shareholder approval, which could be used to dilute the ownership of a potential hostile acquirer;.  the Board may decline to record the transfer of any Common Shares on our share register if they believe that: (i) registration of the transfer is required under any federal or state securities law or under the laws of any other jurisdiction and the registration has not yet been effected; or (ii) such transfer is likely to expose us to adverse tax consequences or materially adverse legal or regulatory treatment in any jurisdiction;.  our shareholders may only remove directors for cause, or for other reasons set out in our bye-laws (e.g., unsound mind);.  there are advance notice requirements for shareholders with respect to director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings; and.  under Bermuda law, for so long as Blue Capital Re is registered under the Insurance Act, the BMA may object to a person holding more than 10% of our Common Shares if it appears to the BMA that the person is not or is no longer fit and proper to be such a holder.. The foregoing factors, as well as the significant share ownership by Sompo International, could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination, which could reduce the market value of our Common Shares.. There are provisions in our charter documents that may reduce or increase the voting rights of our Common Shares.. The bye-laws of Blue Capital generally provide that any shareholder owning, directly, indirectly or, in the case of any U.S. person, by attribution, outstanding Common Shares possessing more than 9.5% of the aggregate voting power of our Common Shares will have their voting rights reduced so that they may not exercise more than 9.5% of the voting rights conferred by our Common Shares. Under these provisions, certain shareholders may have their voting rights limited to less than one vote per share, while other shareholders may have voting rights in excess of one vote per share. In addition, our bye-laws provide that if any U.S. person acquires actual knowledge that such person owns, directly or indirectly, 9.0% or more of our Common Shares, such person must deliver notice to us within 10 days of acquiring such knowledge. Our bye-laws further provide that the Board may determine that certain shares shall not carry voting rights or shall have reduced voting rights to the extent that the Board reasonably determines it is necessary to avoid any adverse tax consequences or materially adverse legal or regulatory treatment.. 43. Table of Contents. The bye-laws of Blue Capital provide that, where possible, shareholders will be notified of their voting interests prior to any vote to be taken by the shareholders.. As a result of any reallocation of votes, your voting rights might increase above 5% of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding Common Shares, thereby possibly resulting in your becoming a reporting person subject to Schedule 13D or 13G filing requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). In addition, the reallocation of your votes could result in your becoming subject to filing requirements under Section 16 of the Exchange Act.. We also have the authority to request information from any shareholder for the purpose of determining whether a shareholder's voting rights are to be reallocated pursuant to the bye-laws. If a shareholder fails to respond to a request for information from us or submits incomplete or inaccurate information in response to a request, we may, in our reasonable discretion, reduce or eliminate the shareholder's voting rights.. A shareholder may be required to sell its shares of Blue Capital.. Under our bye-laws and subject to Bermuda law, we have the option, but not the obligation, to require a shareholder to sell some or all of its Common Shares to us at fair market value (which would be based upon the average closing price of our shares as defined under our bye-laws) if the Board reasonably determines, in good faith based on an opinion of counsel, that share ownership, directly, indirectly or constructively, by such shareholder is likely to result in adverse tax, regulatory or legal consequences to us, certain of our other shareholders or our subsidiaries.. There are regulatory limitations on the ownership and transfer of our Common Shares.. The Insurance Act requires that, in respect of a company whose shares are listed on a stock exchange recognized by the BMA, any person who becomes (or ceases to be) a holder of at least 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% of the shares of an insurance or reinsurance company or its parent must notify the BMA in writing within 45 days of becoming such a holder or 30 days from the date they have knowledge of having such a holding, whichever is later. This requirement will apply to us as long as our shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the Bermuda Stock Exchange. If our Common Shares are no longer listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the Bermuda Stock Exchange or another exchange recognized by the BMA, the BMA may, by written notice, object to a person holding 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% of our Common Shares if it appears to the BMA that the person is not fit and proper to be such a holder. The BMA may require the holder to reduce its shareholding in us and may direct, among other things, that the voting rights attaching to its shares shall not be exercisable. A person that does not comply with such a notice or direction from the BMA will be guilty of an offense.. Blue Capital Re is also required to notify the BMA in writing in the event any person has become or has ceased to be a Controller or an officer of it, an officer being a director, chief executive or senior executive performing duties of underwriting, actuarial, risk management, compliance, internal audit, finance or investment matters.. Except in connection with the settlement of trades or transactions entered into through the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange and the Bermuda Stock Exchange, the Board may generally require any shareholder or any person proposing to acquire our Common Shares to provide the information required under our bye-laws. If any such shareholder or proposed acquirer does not provide such information, or if the Board has reason to believe that any certification or other information provided pursuant to any such request is inaccurate or incomplete, the Board may decline to register any transfer or to effect any issuance or purchase of Common Shares to which such request is related.. U.S. persons who own our Common Shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than U.S. persons who are shareholders of a U.S. corporation.. The Companies Act, which applies to Blue Capital, differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. These differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest, the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers.. Bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our shares.. We are organized under the laws of Bermuda. As a result, our corporate affairs are governed by the Companies Act, which differs in some material respects from laws typically applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including the provisions relating to interested directors, amalgamations, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors. Generally, the duties of directors and officers of a Bermuda company are owed to the company. 44. Table of Contents. only. Shareholders of Bermuda companies typically do not have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances. Class actions are not available under Bermuda law. The circumstances in which derivative actions may be available under Bermuda law are substantially more proscribed and less clear than they would be to shareholders of U.S. corporations. The Bermuda courts, however, would ordinarily be expected to permit a shareholder to commence an action in the name of a company to remedy a wrong to the company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of the company or illegal, or would result in the violation of the company's memorandum of association or bye-laws. Furthermore, consideration would be given by a Bermuda court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or, for instance, where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of the company's shareholders than that which actually approved it.. When the affairs of a company are being conducted in a manner that is oppressive or prejudicial to the interests of some shareholders, one or more shareholders may apply to the Supreme Court of Bermuda, which may make such order as it sees fit, including an order regulating the conduct of the company's affairs in the future or ordering the purchase of the shares of any shareholders by other shareholders or by the company. Additionally, under our bye-laws and as permitted by Bermuda law, each shareholder has waived any claim or right of action against our directors or officers for any action taken by directors or officers in the performance of their duties, except for actions involving fraud or dishonesty. In addition, the rights of holders of our Common Shares and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Bermuda law are not as clearly established as under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in jurisdictions in the U.S., particularly the State of Delaware. Therefore, holders of our Common Shares may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction within the U.S.. Anti-takeover provisions in our bye-laws could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors, which could diminish the value of our Common Shares.. Blue Capital's bye-laws contain provisions that may make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so. In addition, these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable. Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Common Shares if they are viewed as discouraging changes in management and takeover attempts in the future.. The price of our Common Shares may fluctuate significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment.. Volatility in the market price of our Common Shares may prevent you from being able to sell your Common Shares at or above the price you paid for your Common Shares. The market price for our Common Shares can fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including:.  catastrophes that may specifically impact us or are perceived by investors as impacting the reinsurance market in general;.  the financial condition, financial performance and prospects of the Company, the Manager or Sompo International;.  our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;.  exposure to capital market risks related to the performance of insurance-linked investments;.  our capital management policy and whether we repurchase Common Shares or dividends on our Common Shares have been, and are likely to be, declared and paid from time to time;.  actual or anticipated growth rates relative to our competitors;.  perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our Common Shares relative to other investment alternatives, including investment opportunities in Sompo International or affiliates of Sompo International;.  speculation by the investment community regarding our business;.  future announcements concerning our business or our competitors' businesses;.  the public's reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;.  market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our strategy;.  strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, restructurings, significant contracts or joint ventures;.  changes in government regulation;.  potential characterization of us as an investment company, a controlled foreign corporation or a passive foreign investment company;. 45. Table of Contents.  general market, economic and political conditions;.  changes in conditions or trends in our industry, geographies or customers;.  arrival and departure of key personnel of the Company, the Manager or Sompo International;.  sales of our Common Shares by us, Sompo International, our directors or members of our management team; and.  adverse resolution of litigation against us.. In addition, stock markets, including the New York Stock Exchange and the Bermuda Stock Exchange, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. In the past, some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to class action or derivative lawsuits. The filing of a lawsuit against us, regardless of the outcome, could have a negative effect on our business, as it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources.. As a result of the factors described above, investors in our Common Shares may not be able to resell their Common Shares at or above the price they paid or may not be able to resell them at all. These market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our Common Shares, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and the trading volume of our Common Shares are low.. It may be difficult to enforce service of process and enforcement of judgments against us and our officers and directors.. Blue Capital is a Bermuda company and certain of its officers and directors are residents of jurisdictions outside the United States. A substantial portion of its assets and its officers and directors, at any one time, are or may be located in jurisdictions outside the United States. It may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States on our directors and officers who reside outside the United States or to enforce against us or our directors and officers judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.. There is no treaty in force between the United States and Bermuda providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. As a result, whether a United States judgment would be enforceable in Bermuda against us or our directors and officers depends on whether the U.S. court that entered the judgment is recognized by the Bermuda court as having jurisdiction over us or our directors and officers, as determined by reference to Bermuda conflict of law rules.. In addition to and irrespective of jurisdictional issues, the Bermuda courts will not enforce a United States federal securities law that is either penal or contrary to Bermuda public policy. An action brought pursuant to a public or penal law, the purpose of which is the enforcement of a sanction, power or right at the instance of the state in its sovereign capacity, will not be entertained by a Bermuda court. Consequently, certain remedies available under the laws of U.S. jurisdictions, including certain remedies under U.S. federal securities laws, may not be available under Bermuda law or enforceable in a Bermuda court, as they may be contrary to Bermuda public policy. Further, no claim may be brought in Bermuda against us or our directors and officers in the first instance for violation of U.S. federal securities laws because these laws have no extraterritorial jurisdiction under Bermuda law and do not have force of law in Bermuda. A Bermuda court may, however, impose civil liability on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under Bermuda law.. TAXATION RISKS. We and our subsidiaries may be subject to U.S. tax which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. The Company and its subsidiaries are Bermuda companies. Each intends to operate in such a manner that none will be deemed to be engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. However, whether business is being conducted in the United States is an inherently factual determination. Because definitive identification of activities which constitute being engaged in a trade or business in the United States is not provided by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), regulations or court decisions, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\") might successfully contend that any of the Company and/or its subsidiaries are/is engaged in a trade or business in the United States. A non-U.S. corporation deemed to be so engaged would be subject to U.S. income tax at regular corporate rates, as well as the branch profits tax, on its income that is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business unless the corporation is entitled to relief under the permanent establishment provision of an applicable tax treaty, as discussed below.. 46. Table of Contents. Such income tax, if imposed, would be based on effectively connected income computed in a manner generally analogous to that applied to the income of a U.S. corporation, except that a non-U.S. corporation is generally entitled to deductions and credits only if it timely files a U.S. federal income tax return. Each of the Company and Blue Capital Re file protective U.S. federal income tax returns on a timely basis in order to preserve the right to claim income tax deductions and credits if it is ever determined that it is subject to U.S. federal income tax. The highest marginal federal income tax rates as of 2018 are 21% for a corporation's effectively connected income and 30% for the branch profits tax. If Blue Capital Re were to qualify for benefits under the tax treaty between the United States and Bermuda (the \"Bermuda treaty\"), Blue Capital Re would not be subject to U.S. income tax on any business profits of its insurance enterprise found to be effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, unless that trade or business is conducted through a permanent establishment in the United States. Blue Capital Re does not have sufficient information about its ownership to determine whether it would be entitled to the benefits of the Bermuda Treaty. However, based on the information that it does possess, Blue Capital Re believes that it may not be entitled to the benefits of the Bermuda Treaty. If the Company and/or its subsidiaries were subject to U.S. federal income tax, our financial condition and results of operations, as well as an investment in our Common Shares, could be materially adversely affected.. U.S persons who hold our Common Shares may be subject to U.S. income taxation at ordinary income tax rates on our undistributed earnings and profits under the controlled foreign corporation (\"CFC\") rules.. If the Company or any of its subsidiaries were considered a CFC, any \"10% U.S. Shareholder\" (as defined below) may be subject to current U.S. income taxation at ordinary income tax rates on all or a portion of the Company's or its subsidiaries' undistributed earnings and profits attributable to the Company's insurance and reinsurance income, including underwriting and investment income and other subpart F income. Any gain realized on a sale of our Common Shares by such shareholder may also be taxed as a dividend to the extent of the Company's earnings and profits attributed to such shares during the period that the shareholder held the shares and while the Company was a CFC (with certain adjustments). A foreign corporation is considered a CFC if 10% U.S. Shareholders own (directly, indirectly through foreign entities or constructively pursuant to the application of certain constructive ownership rules) more than 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of voting stock of such foreign corporation, or the total value of all stock of such corporation. For purposes of taking into account insurance income, a CFC also includes a foreign corporation in which more than 25% of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock is owned (directly, indirectly through foreign entities or constructively pursuant to the application of certain constructive ownership rules) by 10% U.S. Shareholders, on any day during the taxable year of such corporation, if the gross amount of premiums or other consideration for the reinsurance or the issuing of insurance contracts exceeds 75% of the gross amount of all premiums or other consideration in respect of all risks.. The Company's organizational documents provide that if Common Shares owned by any person, directly, indirectly or, in the case of any U.S. person, by attribution, would otherwise possess more than 9.5% of the aggregate voting power of all our Common Shares, the voting rights attached to those shares will be reduced so that such person may not exercise and is not attributed more than 9.5% of the total voting power of our Common Shares. These provisions were intended to reduce the likelihood that a shareholder of the Company would be a \"10 % U.S. Shareholder\" as defined below, and that the Company and its subsidiaries are treated as CFCs in any taxable year.. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted a budget reconciliation act amending the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \"TCJA\").  Prior to the enactment of the TCJA, a \"10% U.S. Shareholder\" was defined as any shareholder that is a U.S. person that owns directly, indirectly or by attribution, 10% or more of the total voting power of the Company.  However, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the TCJA expands the definition of a \"10 % U.S. Shareholder\" to include U.S. persons that own directly, indirectly or by attribution, 10% or more of either the total voting power of the Company or total value of the stock of the Company.  TCJA also expands the application of the constructive ownership rules that are applied for determining whether a U.S. person is a 10% U.S. Shareholder of a foreign corporation. Under prior law, certain ownership attribution rules did not apply so as to treat a U.S. person as owning stock that is owned by a non-U.S. person. TCJA has repealed this limitation. Consequently, under the new attribution rules, Common Shares owned by Endurance Bermuda would be treated as owned by Endurance U.S. Holdings Corp. Accordingly, Endurance U.S. Holdings Corp. would be treated as a 10% U.S. Shareholder for purposes of determining whether Blue Capital Re is a CFC. The Senate Finance Committee suggested, however, that the repeal of the limitation to the ownership attribution rules is not intended to cause a foreign corporation to be treated as a CFC with respect to an unrelated U.S. person, such as an investor for example. Until further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department or the IRS that confirms or otherwise codifies this intent, based on the technical application of the TCJA, we would be treated as a CFC for purposes of taking into account our insurance income. By expanding the constructive ownership rules and the definition of 10% U.S. Shareholder, the TCJA will increase the likelihood that an investor could be treated as a 10% U.S. Shareholder in 2018 and in any subsequent taxable years. Investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the CFC rules to an investment in our Common Shares.. 47. Table of Contents. U.S. persons who hold our Common Shares may be subject to U.S. income taxation on their pro rata share of our related party insurance income (\"RPII\").. The CFC rules apply to certain insurance and reinsurance companies that earn RPII. If the RPII rules were to apply to Blue Capital Re, a U.S. person who owns our Common Shares directly, or indirectly through foreign entities, on the last day of the taxable year would be required to include in its income for U.S. federal income tax purposes the shareholder's pro rata share of Blue Capital Re's RPII for the entire taxable year, determined as if such RPII were distributed proportionately to such U.S. shareholders at that date regardless of whether such income is distributed. In addition, any RPII that is to be included in the income of a U.S. tax-exempt organization would be treated as unrelated business taxable income. Although Blue Capital Re intends to generally operate in a manner so as to qualify for certain exceptions to the RPII rules, there can be no assurance that these exceptions will be available. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that U.S. persons who own our Common Shares will not be required to recognize gross income inclusions attributable to RPII.. U.S. persons who dispose of our Common Shares may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation at the rates applicable to ordinary income.. Section 1248 of the Code, in conjunction with the RPII rules, provides that if a shareholder who is a U.S. person disposes of shares in a foreign insurance corporation that has RPII and in which U.S. persons collectively own 25% or more of the shares, by vote or value, at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the disposition any gain from the disposition will generally be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the shareholder's share of the corporation's undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the shareholder owned the shares (possibly whether or not such earnings and profits are attributable to RPII). In addition, such a shareholder will be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, regardless of the amount of shares owned by the shareholder. These rules should not apply to dispositions of our Common Shares because the Company is not itself directly engaged in the insurance business. The RPII provisions, however, have not been interpreted by the courts or the U.S. Treasury Department, and regulations interpreting the RPII provisions of the Code exist only in proposed form. Accordingly, the IRS might interpret the proposed regulations in a different manner and the applicable proposed regulations may be promulgated in final form in a manner that would cause these rules to apply to dispositions of our Common Shares.. U.S. persons who hold our Common Shares will be subject to adverse tax consequences if we are considered a passive foreign investment company (\"PFIC\") for U.S. federal income tax purposes.. A foreign corporation will generally be considered a PFIC during a given year if (i) 75% or more of its gross income constitutes \"passive income\" or (ii) 50% or more of its assets produce passive income. For purposes of the PFIC determination, passive income generally includes interest, dividends, annuities and other investment income. The PFIC statutory provisions contain an express exception for income derived in the active conduct of an insurance business. The PFIC statutory provisions also contain a look through rule stating that, for purposes of determining whether a foreign corporation is a PFIC, such foreign corporation shall be treated as if it received directly its proportionate share of the income and as if it held its proportionate share of the assets of any other corporation in which it owns at least 25% by value of the shares. While no explicit guidance is provided by the statutory language, under this look-through rule the Company should be deemed to own the assets and to have received the income of Blue Capital Re directly for purposes of determining whether it qualifies for the insurance business exception.. We believe that we should not be considered a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the year ended December 31, 2017. However, although there are no currently effective Treasury Regulations regarding the application of the PFIC provisions to an insurance company, proposed regulations were published in April 2015, which, if finalized in their current form, could adversely impact the ability of Blue Capital Re, and thereby the Company, to satisfy the insurance business exception. In addition, the TCJA limited the exception applicable to corporations engaged in the active conduct of an insurance business by requiring that the applicable insurance liabilities of such corporation exceed 25 percent of its total assets for the exception to apply. It is unclear how liability reserves are measured and taken into account for purposes of determining the applicable insurance liabilities. Even under favorable interpretation, we currently do not appear to meet the 25% test. If a corporation fails the 25% test, the TCJA provides an alternative test which permits a U.S. person that owns stock in such corporation to elect to treat such stock as stock of a qualifying insurance corporation if (A) the corporation's applicable insurance liabilities are at least equal to 10% of its total assets and (B) under Treasury Regulations to be issued, based on the applicable facts and circumstances, (i) the corporation is predominantly engaged in an insurance business and (ii) the failure to satisfy the 25% test is due solely to runoff-related or rating-related circumstances involving such insurance business. Since there are no current Treasury Regulations interpreting this alternative test, it is not clear what facts and circumstances would be required to satisfy the test or the procedures required to make the election. Consequently, although there are ambiguities in the application of the. 48. Table of Contents. relevant provisions of the TCJA and the PFIC provisions in general, it appears that under the new law we could be considered a PFIC for the taxable year ended December 31, 2018. Because PFIC status is determined at the end of the taxable year, however, we do not currently know whether this will be the case. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not be considered a PFIC for the current or any future taxable years.. If we were considered a PFIC, it could have material adverse tax consequences for an investor that is subject to U.S. federal income taxation, including subjecting the investor to a greater tax liability than might otherwise apply or subjecting the investor to tax on amounts in advance of when tax would otherwise be imposed. Such investor may be able to mitigate certain of these adverse tax consequences if it is able to make a timely qualified electing fund election (a \"QEF election\") or a mark-to-market election with respect to our Common Shares. A QEF election may only be made by a holder of our Common Shares if, inter alia, the Company provides such holder with certain information. It is uncertain whether the Company would be able to provide investors with the information necessary to make a QEF election.  In addition, if we were considered a PFIC, dividends paid in respect of our Common Shares would not be eligible for the preferential tax rate applicable to \"qualified dividend income\" received by certain non-corporate U.S. shareholders. The rules regarding PFICs including the QEF election and mark-to-market election, are complex. Investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the PFIC rules to an investment in our Common Shares.. Legislative and regulatory action by the U.S. Congress could materially and adversely affect the Company.. The Company's tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof. Legislative action may be taken by the U.S. Congress which, if ultimately enacted, could, adversely affect the results of our operations and financial condition and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\") and the European Union (\"EU\") are considering measures that might increase our taxes and reduce our net income.. The OECD has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non-member countries on measures to limit harmful tax practices. In particular, as a result of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\"BEPS\") project, the OECD and the G20 delivered a package of policies that will allow governments to address the gaps in the international tax system. The BEPS package included four new minimum standards which included the commitment to (i) address harmful tax practices; (ii) to prevent tax treaty shopping; (iii) to ensure country-by-country reporting; and (iv) to improve the effectiveness of cross-border tax dispute resolution.. Bermuda has not been listed in the OECD's periodic progression reports as an uncooperative tax haven jurisdiction because it had previously committed to eliminate harmful tax practices and to embrace international tax standards for transparency, exchange of information and the elimination of any aspects of the regimes for financial and other services that attract business with no substantial domestic activity. Bermuda was reported as being largely compliant with the OECD's international tax standards on transparency and exchange of information in the OECD's 2016 Tax Transparency Report on Progress. Bermuda set up its Tax Information Reporting Portal in June 2017, and it is due to undertake its first automatic exchange of information in June 2018. Other \"largely compliant\" jurisdictions include Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. In 2017 Bermuda issued its common reporting standard regulations and country-by-country reporting regulations.. In addition, on July 12, 2016 Council Directive 2016/1164/EU (\"ATAD\") was adopted which laid down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functions of the internal market. Member States are required to implement ATAD into domestic law by January 1, 2019 (except in relation to the exit tax rule and the interest restriction rules which in certain circumstances need not be implemented until January 1, 2020 and 2024 respectively). In October 2016 the EU Commission presented its corporate tax reform package in which the Commission proposed that the provisions of the ATAD dealing with hybrid mismatches should be extended to hybrid mismatches with third countries and on May 29, 2017 Council Directive 2017/952/EU (\"ATAD II\") was adopted. Member States are required to implement ATAD II into domestic law by December 31, 2019.. We are currently not able to provide a definitive view on whether any changes arising from any proposals introduced in connection with the possible new OECD and EU measures will subject us to additional taxes or otherwise affect our operations.. 49. Table of Contents. We may become subject to taxes in Bermuda after March 31, 2035, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.. The Bermuda Minister of Finance, under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966, as amended, of Bermuda, has given the Company and its subsidiaries an assurance that if any legislation is enacted in Bermuda that would \"impose tax computed on profits or income or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then the imposition\" of any such tax will not be applicable to the Company, its subsidiaries or any of their respective operations, shares or other obligations until March 31, 2035. It is possible that after March 31, 2035 we may be subject to Bermuda taxes.. 50. Table of Contents"
