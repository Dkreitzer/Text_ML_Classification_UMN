[1] "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS. Risks Related to Our Business. We have a history of losses and may incur losses in the foreseeable future.. We do not have a significant operating history upon which potential investors may assess future performance. PVGI acquired its first two veterinary hospitals in September 2004 and acquired additional veterinary hospitals throughout 2005, 2006 and 2007. We also acquired a veterinary hospital in 2008. We have only incurred losses to date. We are continuing to develop our operational infrastructure and face additional risks similar to those of other businesses with limited operating history. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, delays, problems and difficulties frequently encountered in the establishment of a new business. Operating results may also vary depending on a number of factors, many of which are outside our control, including:. <U+0095>           changes in pricing policies or those of our competitors;         <U+0095>           the hiring and retention of key personnel;         <U+0095>           fluctuation in costs related to acquisitions of businesses;         <U+0095>           wage and cost pressures;         <U+0095>           availability of facilities that are suitable for acquisition;         <U+0095>           viability of the hub and spoke model;         <U+0095>           hiring and retention of veterinarians;         <U+0095>           increased competition and pricing pressure;. 7. Table of Contents. <U+0095>           seasonal and general economic factors, including a recession or economic slowdown; and         <U+0095>           level of personal discretionary spending.. We have substantial indebtedness which requires a significant amount of cash to service. We may not be able to generate or raise sufficient cash to meet our debt service obligations, and these obligations will reduce the amount of cash available to operate and expand our business.. We have, and will continue to have, a substantial amount of debt, including debt incurred as a result of financing acquisitions and the Senior Notes described below (See \"Risk Factors  -  We may not be able to pay our obligations with respect to our Senior Notes upon maturity, prepayment or redemption\"). Our substantial amount of debt requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to pay down our indebtedness and related interest, thereby reducing the funds available to use for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes. Because interest on the Senior Notes is payable by increasing the principal amount of the Senior Notes, our interest payments on the Senior Notes will not affect cash flow. However, interest on the Senior Notes will increase our interest expense and thereby impact net earnings (loss).. Our ability to make payments on our debt, pay our expenses and fund acquisitions will depend upon our ability to generate cash in the future. Insufficient cash flow could place us at risk of default under our debt agreements which could result in the acceleration of the maturity of our debt obligations and could prevent us from paying fixed costs or expanding our business as planned. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, our strategy to increase operating efficiencies may not be realized and future borrowings may not be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. Our debt comes due in various amounts between 2010 and 2014. In order to meet our debt obligations, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt. We may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.. We may not be able to pay our obligations with respect to our Senior Notes upon maturity, prepayment or redemption.. In the first quarter of 2009, we issued an aggregate original principal amount of $6.5 million of our 12% senior secured convertible notes (the \"Senior Notes\"). The terms of the Senior Notes require us to pay a premium of 184% of the original principal amount of the Senior Notes (in addition to the repayment of the then-outstanding principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest) (i) upon any repayment of the Senior Notes at maturity, (ii) if accelerated upon the occurrence of an \"event of default\" (as defined in the Senior Notes), or (iii) upon any redemption or prepayment of the Senior Notes prior to maturity. Accordingly, the amount due upon maturity, prepayment or redemption of the $6.5 million principal amount of Senior Notes outstanding as of the date of this report will be approximately $18.5 million after giving effect to such premium, but before giving effect to future increases in the principal amount outstanding as payment-in-kind of the interest on the outstanding Senior Notes. After giving effect to payment-in-kind of interest on the Senior Notes by increasing the outstanding principal through maturity, the amount due on maturity of the Senior Notes at January 21, 2013 would be approximately $22.4 million. We do not currently have the resources to pay the full redemption price in cash, and anticipate that we would need to refinance such debt prior to its maturity or redemption. We have not established a sinking fund for payment of our obligations under the Senior Notes, nor do we anticipate doing so.. Our debt instruments may adversely affect our ability to run our business.. Our substantial amount of debt, as well as the guarantees of our subsidiaries and the security interests in our assets and those of our subsidiaries, could impair our ability to operate our business effectively and may limit our ability to take advantage of business opportunities. For example, our debt instruments contain certain restrictions that:. <U+0095>           limit our ability to borrow additional funds or to obtain other financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments or general corporate purposes;         <U+0095>           limit our ability to dispose of our assets, create liens on our assets or to extend credit; and         <U+0095>           make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions;. 8. Table of Contents. If compliance with our debt obligations materially hinders our ability to operate our business and adapt to changing industry conditions, we may lose market share, our revenue may decline and our operating results may suffer.. The issuance of the Senior Notes and related financing warrants will impact net earnings (loss) going forward.. We recorded $3.6 million as a debt discount to the Senior Notes. Additionally, we also recorded approximately $930,000 of fees and expenses related to the sale of the Senior Notes, as a debt discount as well. We are amortizing these amounts over the life of the Senior Notes. Additionally, we are accounting for the 184% debt discount as a loan accretion, by which we are charging the accretion to interest expense, which amounts to approximately $12.0 million, over the life of the loan. Interest on the Senior Notes is paid by increasing the principal amount of the Senior Notes, which will increase our interest expense going forward. Furthermore, a number of the holders of outstanding \"seller notes\" agreed to a \"standstill\" provision contemplated by the loan documentation in exchange for warrants and/or a higher interest rate on their notes, which will also increase our interest expense going forward.. Galen and Camden, investors in the Senior Notes, may have the ability to significantly influence our business and affairs.. A representative of Camden Partners Strategic Fund III, L.P. and Camden Partners Strategic Fund III-A, L.P. (collectively, \"Camden\") and a representative of Galen Partners IV, L.P., Galen Partners International IV, L.P. and Galen Employee Fund IV, L.P. (collectively, \"Galen,\" and together with Camden, collectively, the \"lead investors\") serve on our board of directors. In addition, the lead investors currently hold a significant principal amount of the issued and outstanding Senior Notes, and accordingly, control our ability to obtain consents, waivers and amendments with respect to the loan documentation and covenants contained therein. In addition, the lead investors are each substantial shareholders in our company.. We may be unable to effectively execute our growth strategy which could cause our margins and profitability to decline. Even if we are able to effectively execute our growth strategy, the growth of the business may put a strain on the business, and we may not achieve desired economies of scale.. Our success depends in part on our ability to build on our position as a leading animal healthcare services company through selective acquisitions of established animal hospitals and internal growth initiatives. If we cannot implement or effectively execute this strategy, our results of operations may be adversely affected. We intend, as part of our growth strategies, to acquire additional veterinary hospitals. We may not be able to attract or compete successfully for prospective acquisition candidates or achieve sufficient \"cluster\" hospitals in any market we may target in order to achieve targeted efficiencies. In addition, acquisitions may take longer than anticipated or may not be cost effective.. Results of operations may be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage our growth effectively, which may increase costs of operations and hinder our ability to execute our business strategy. Our internal revenue growth from new services and pet pharmaceuticals as well as our expected cost savings may not develop as anticipated, and reduction in our expected rate of internal growth may cause our revenue and margins to decrease from management's expectations. Expected growth may place a significant strain on management and operational systems and resources. If our business grows, we will need to improve and enhance our overall financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures, and expand, train and manage our workforce. We will also need to increase the capacity of current systems to meet additional demands.. Even if we effectively implement our growth strategy, we may not achieve the presently targeted internal growth and the growth may be below historical rates. Any reductions in the rate of internal growth may cause revenues and margins to decrease. Investors should not assume that the historical growth rates and margins are reliable indicators of results in future periods.. Failure to satisfy covenants in our debt instruments will cause a default under those instruments.. In addition to imposing restrictions on our business and operations, some of our debt instruments include a number of covenants imposing restrictions on our business and operations, and we may borrow money on terms requiring us. 9. Table of Contents. to meet financial ratios and other tests. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under these instruments. An event of default would permit our lenders and other debtholders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we are unable the repay debt to our senior lenders, these lenders and debtholders could proceed against our assets.. Incurring substantial amounts of debt could adversely affect our financial condition.. Leverage. We have and may continue to utilize a leveraged capital structure to, among other things, fund our operations. We have issued promissory notes and other forms of debt in connection with past acquisitions and may likely do so in the future. As a result, we are, and in the future may be, subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including, (i) the risk that cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, (ii) the risk that existing debt (which will not have been fully amortized at maturity) will not be able to be refinanced or that the terms of such refinancings will not be as favorable to us, and (iii) the risk that necessary capital expenditures will not be able to be financed on favorable terms or at all.. Risk of Rising Interest Rates. While currently all of our debt bears interest at a fixed rate, we may incur indebtedness in the future that also bears interest at a variable rate or may be required to refinance our debt at higher rates. By its very nature, a variable interest rate will move up or down based on changes in the economy and other factors, all of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that such rates will not rise significantly and, consequently, that we would be required to pay more interest than is anticipated. A significant increase in market interest rates could jeopardize our ability to pay required debt service on loans and could possibly result in a default under the loan and/or foreclosure.. Limitations on Debt. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness we may incur. Accordingly, we could become more leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service that could increase the risk of default on our indebtedness.. Our business strategy includes growth through acquisitions, which involve special risks that could increase expenses, and divert the time and attention of management. Difficulties integrating new acquisitions may impose substantial costs and disrupt our business, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.. As part of our business strategy, we have in the past acquired veterinary hospitals. We expect to continue to acquire animal hospitals. Acquisitions involve a number of special risks and challenges, including:. <U+0095>           diversion of management's attention from our existing business;   <U+0095>           integration of acquired veterinary hospitals and employees into our existing business, including coordination of geographically dispersed operations, which can take longer and be more complex than initially expected;   <U+0095>           dependence on retention, hiring and training of key personnel, including specialists;   <U+0095>           loss or termination of employees, including costs associated with the termination of those employees;   <U+0095>           dilution of then-current stockholders' percentage ownership;   <U+0095>           dilution of earnings if synergies with the acquired veterinary hospitals are not achieved;   <U+0095>           inability to generate sufficient revenue and profitability to offset acquisition or investment costs;   <U+0095>           assumption of liabilities of the acquired businesses, including costly litigation related to alleged liabilities of the acquired businesses; and   <U+0095>           risk of impairment charges related to potential write-down of acquired assets in future acquisitions.. Acquisitions of veterinary hospitals are inherently risky and create many challenges. Future acquisitions may not achieve the desired objectives. If we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects may be seriously harmed.. We may be unsuccessful in the integration of the acquired businesses that are new to our operations. The process of integration may require a disproportionate amount of the time and attention of management, which may distract. 10. Table of Contents. management's attention from its day-to-day duties. During these periods, there may be less attention directed to marketing efforts or staffing issues, which could affect our revenue and expenses. In addition, any interruption or deterioration in service resulting from an acquisition may result in a customer's decision to stop doing business with us. Any difficulties in the integration process could result in increased expense, loss of customers and a decline in profitability or an increase in exiting losses. We have experienced delays and increased costs in integrating acquired businesses. We also could experience delays in converting the systems of acquired businesses into our systems, which could result in increased staff and payroll expense as well as delays in reporting our results, both for a particular region and on a consolidated basis. Further, the legal and business environment prevalent in new territories and with respect to new businesses may pose risks that we do not anticipate and could adversely impact our ability to integrate newly acquired operations. For all of these reasons, our historical record in integrating acquired businesses is not a reliable indicator of our ability to do so in the future. If we are not successful in timely and cost-effectively integrating future acquisitions, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.. The termination or failure to renew a lease or sublease for a veterinary hospital facility would require us to relocate such hospital to a different facility and make substantial capital expenditures, which could disrupt our business and adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.. The majority of our veterinary hospital facilities are leased or subleased. Certain of these leases or subleases are on a month-to-month basis or do not include a renewal option. We may be unable to renew these leases or subleases upon termination or expiration on terms acceptable to us or at all. Higher lease costs could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Failure by a lessor or sublessor to renew an existing lease or sublease could require us to relocate to a different facility which could disrupt our business and require us to make significant capital expenditures for leasehold improvements which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.. Loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business.. Our results of operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified directors, executive officers, veterinarians and other employees. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain highly qualified persons for such positions, which could have a material adverse effect on us.. Due to the fixed cost nature of our business, fluctuations in our revenue could adversely affect its operating income.. A substantial portion of our expenses, particularly rent and personnel costs, are relatively fixed costs and are based in part on expectations of revenue. We may be unable to reduce spending in a timely manner to compensate for any significant fluctuations in our revenue. Accordingly, shortfalls in revenue may adversely affect our operating income.. Demand for certain products and services, including animal vaccinations, may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.. Demand for vaccinations will be impacted in the future as protocols for vaccinations change. Some professionals in the industry have recommended that vaccinations be given less frequently. In the summer of 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated a publication on animal vaccinations, which called for less frequent canine revaccinations. The study concluded that some vaccinations remain effective for periods of three to five years, suggesting that veterinarians should decrease the frequency of vaccinations. Our veterinarians establish their own vaccine protocols. Some of our veterinarians have changed their protocols and others may change their protocols in light of such recent and/or future literature. A decrease in the frequency of revaccinations and the related revenue could adversely affect our results of operations.. The frequency of customer visits to our animal hospitals may also decline. We believe that the frequency of visits is impacted by several trends in the industry. Pet-related products, including medication prescriptions, traditionally sold at animal hospitals, have become more widely available in retail stores and other channels of distribution, including the internet. Client visits may also be negatively impacted as a result of preventative care and better pet. 11. Table of Contents. nutrition. If demand for retail products, vaccinations or for our services generally decline, the frequency of visits may decline which may result in a reduction in revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.. Further economic downturn could materially adversely affect our business and recessionary economic conditions may reduce demand for our services.. Our business may be materially adversely affected by negative trends in the general economy that reduce consumer spending. Our business depends on the ability and willingness of animal owners to pay for its services. This dependence could make us more vulnerable to any reduction in consumer confidence or disposable income as compared to companies in other industries that are less reliant on consumer spending, such as the human health care industry, in which a large portion of payments are made by insurance programs. The current financial crises and related economic uncertainty have had a significant impact on our revenue and profitability. Other veterinary care providers similar to us have recently reported a decline in demand for their veterinary services due, in part, to present economic conditions. If demand for our veterinary services similarly declines, our operating results will be negatively impacted. In addition, declines in our profitability could result in a charge to earnings for the impairment of goodwill, which would not affect our cash flow but could decrease our earnings, and our stock price could be adversely affected. Additionally, many of the effects and consequences of the global financial crisis currently are unknown, and may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, including our ability to refinance our existing long-term debt, raise additional capital if needed, and may negatively impact our business and financial results.. Goodwill and other intangible assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets. We must test our intangible assets for impairment at least annually, which may result in a material, non-cash write down of goodwill and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and stockholders' equity.. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment assessments at least annually (or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred) by applying a fair-value based test. These impairment assessments may result in a material, non-cash write-down of goodwill. An impairment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and stockholders' equity.. During the fourth quarter of 2009, in conjunction with our annual impairment test of goodwill, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $22.5 million. The factors that caused us to record the impairment were primarily the decreased revenues sustained in 2009 from the decline in the U.S. economy coupled with the increased amount of debt incurred by the Company. The fair market valuation of the reporting units was based on an income and market approach.. Shortages of skilled veterinarians may cause us to experience hiring difficulties which could result in a disruption of our business.. As the pet population continues to grow, the need for skilled veterinarians continues to increase. If we are unable to retain an adequate number of skilled veterinarians, we may lose customers, our revenue may decline and we may need to sell or close animal hospitals. As of December 2009, there were 28 veterinary schools in the country accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association. These schools graduate approximately 2,500 veterinarians per year. There is a shortage of skilled veterinarians in some regional markets in which we operate animal hospitals. During shortages in these regions, we may be unable to hire enough qualified veterinarians to adequately staff our animal hospitals, in which event we may lose market share and our revenues and profitability may decline.. Currently existing or newly enacted laws and regulations could restrict our business or result in significant costs and expenses. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.. We may expand our operations into states which have laws and regulations that prohibit business corporations from providing, or holding themselves out as providers of, veterinary-medical care. In those states, we will be unable to provide veterinary services or own veterinary practices. However, if we choose to enter such states, we would seek. 12. Table of Contents. alternative structures for operating in those states, including providing management and other administrative services to veterinary practices located in these states. Although we will seek to structure our operations to comply with the veterinary medicine laws of each state in which we operate, given the varying and uncertain interpretations of these laws, we may not be in compliance with restrictions on the corporate practice of veterinary medicine in all states. A determination that we are in violation of applicable restrictions on the practice of veterinary medicine in any state in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our operations, particularly if we are unable to restructure our operations to comply with the requirements of that state.. In addition, most states impose various registration requirements on veterinarians and veterinary hospitals. To fulfill these requirements, we are required to register each of our facilities with appropriate governmental agencies and, where required, appoint a licensed veterinarian to act on behalf of each facility. All veterinarians practicing in our clinics are required to maintain valid state licenses to practice. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations.. The possible widespread implementation of pet insurance could adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.. The possible widespread implementation of pet insurance and our operation under such insurance could impose additional fees and costs upon us and reduce the revenue from services and related items. If we do not accept such insurance or choose not to participate in pet insurance programs, it could place us at a competitive disadvantage. Acceptance of pet insurance could result in a reduction in fees or the possible imposition of caps for services. The involvement of insurance companies could also increase various administrative requirements related to the submission and processing of claims resulting in a delay in payments or disputes regarding the terms and amounts of available coverage.. We face increasing competition, including from better-established companies that have significantly greater resources, which places pressure on our pricing and which could prevent us from increasing revenue or maintaining profitability.. The market for our products and services is intensely competitive and is likely to become even more so in the future. Many of our potential competitors have substantial competitive advantages, such as:. <U+0095>           greater name recognition and larger marketing budgets and resources;         <U+0095>           established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases; and         <U+0095>           substantially greater financial, technical and other resources.. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities or customer requirements. For all of the foregoing reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.. The costs of defending litigation and potential claims could be significant and adversely affect our results and financial condition.. From time to time we may be involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. However, the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, and an unfavorable resolution or the costs of defending of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects.. We are subject to local market risks as a result of the geographic concentration of our operations.. Our operations currently are concentrated in the California market. This concentration makes our business subject to the health of California's economy, as well as actual or threatened natural disasters (such as earthquakes and fires) which may disrupt the operations of our veterinarian hospitals, all of which may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.. 13. Table of Contents. Risks Related to our Common Stock. We may not be able to maintain compliance with NASDAQ's continued listing requirements.. Our common stock is presently quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market (\"NASDAQ\"). To maintain our listing on NASDAQ, we must satisfy certain minimum financial and other continued listing standards, including, among other requirements, (i) a $1.00 minimum bid price requirement, (ii) a requirement to maintain either (a) $2.5 million minimum stockholders' equity, (b) $500,000 minimum annual net income or (c) $35 million minimum market value of listed securities, and (ii) a majority of independent directors. Our common stock price has been below the $1.00 minimum bid requirement since November 19, 2008. NASDAQ temporarily suspended the $1.00 minimum bid requirement through July 31, 2009 and reinstated it effective as of August 3, 2009.. On September 15, 2009, we received notification from the NASDAQ Listings Qualifications Department indicating that for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price of our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share required for continued inclusion on NASDAQ as set forth in NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2). In accordance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5810(c) (3) (A), we had 180 calendar days, or until March 15, 2010, to regain compliance. We would achieve compliance with this requirement if at any time before March 15, 2010, the bid price of our common stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. The Company was unable to regain compliance prior to March 15, 2010.. On March 16, 2010, we received a notice from The NASDAQ Stock Market indicating that we are not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing, and as a result our common stock is subject to suspension from trading and delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market at the opening of business on March 25, 2010, unless we request a hearing by March 23, 2010 in accordance with the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. We requested an appeal hearing on March 23, 2010 with the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel (the \"Panel\") to review the delisting determination. The hearing was scheduled by NASDAQ to occur on May 5, 2010. NASDAQ will 'stay' the delisting of our common stock pending the Panel's decision. We are required to present a plan for regaining compliance with the bid price rule which will likely include our potential plan to consummate a reverse stock split which was approved by the stockholders at an annual meeting held on July 28, 2009 subject to approval by our board of directors of the Company, in order to exceed the minimum bid price requirement. The NASDAQ letter stated that historically, \"Panels have generally viewed a reverse stock split in 30  -  60 days as the only definitive plan acceptable to resolve a bid price deficiency.\" Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that NASDAQ will grant our request for the continued listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market.. Effective as of July 28, 2009, Mr. Gary Brukardt retired from our board of directors. Mr. Brukardt also served on our audit committee and, accordingly, Mr. Brukardt's retirement caused our audit committee to have only two members. As a result, we are currently noncompliant with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5605(c)(2)(A), which requires listed companies to have at least three audit committee members. The NASDAQ staff has informed us that we have until the earlier of the date of our next annual shareholders meeting or July 28, 2010 to comply with this requirement. Our board expects to appoint a new independent director to become a member of the audit committee prior to the expiration of the cure period at which time we expect to be in full compliance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5605(c)(2)(A). In addition, if we must record significant impairment or other charges, the Company may have difficulty maintaining its NASDAQ Capital Market listing due to the stockholders' equity requirement.. If the Company is unsuccessful in maintaining its NASDAQ listing, then trading in its common stock after a delisting would likely be conducted in the over-the-counter markets in the so-called \"pink sheets\" or the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board and could also be subject to additional restrictions. There can be no assurance that the Company will meet the continued listing requirements for the NASDAQ Capital Market, or that it will not be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market in the future. The delisting of the Company's common stock could have a material adverse effect on the trading price, liquidity, value and marketability of its common stock. In addition, certain of the Company's outstanding convertible notes provide that the holder may demand payment in full upon the delisting of its common stock from NASDAQ.. 14. Table of Contents. If our securities are delisted from NASDAQ, trading of our securities may be restricted by the SEC's penny stock regulations and FINRA's sales practice requirements, which may limit a holder's ability to buy and sell our securities.. If our securities are delisted from NASDAQ, trading of our securities may be subject to the penny stock rules. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 3a51-1 which generally defines \"penny stock\" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. The penny stock rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and \"accredited investors.\" The term \"accredited investor\" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities if they are delisted from NASDAQ.. In addition to the \"penny stock\" rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\") has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our equity securities, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our equity securities.. The market prices of our securities are likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations.. The market price of our common stock, units and warrants could be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including changes in government regulations and changes in general economic conditions.. In addition, the market prices of our securities could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of additional factors, including:. <U+0095>           announcements of new products or services by our competitors;         <U+0095>           demand for our services;         <U+0095>           changes in the pricing policies of our competitors; and         <U+0095>           changes in government regulations.. The amount of stock held by executive officers, directors and other affiliates may limit your ability to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters requiring stockholder approval.. Our executive officers, directors and affiliates beneficially own a majority of our voting stock. In addition, certain of these stockholders are parties to a board voting agreement pursuant to which they have each agreed for three years following the consummation of the Merger to vote shares beneficially owned by them for the election to our board. 15. Table of Contents. of directors of (a) Robert Wallace, for so long as Mr. Wallace owns two percent or more of its fully diluted shares, (b) five designees named by the stockholders' representatives of PVGI pursuant to the Merger Agreement, one of whom shall be the designee of Galen who shall serve as non-executive vice chairman of our board of directors, and (c) four designees named by Echo's initial stockholders, one of whom shall include Gene Burleson.. These stockholders can have a substantial influence on all matters requiring approval by stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of our company, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the common stock or prevent stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of common stock.. If our existing stockholders exercise their registration rights, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.. Certain stockholders are parties to registration rights agreements which entitle them to require us to register the resale of their shares of common stock under certain circumstances. The lead investors and certain of our directors and executive officers are among the parties to registration rights agreements with us. If these stockholders exercise their registration rights with respect to all of their shares of common stock, then there will be significantly more shares of common stock eligible for trading in the public market. The presence of this additional number of shares of common stock eligible for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.. The exercise of our outstanding warrants and/or conversion of our outstanding convertible securities will result in a dilution of our current stockholders' voting power and an increase in the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market which may negatively impact the market price of our stock.. The conversion or exercise of some or all our convertible debt obligations and warrants could significantly dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.. We had outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 23,870,685 shares of common stock as of December 31, 2009, including without limitation (i) the public warrants to purchase 7,187,500 shares of common stock which are offered hereby, (ii) the founding director warrants to purchase 458,333 shares of common stock subject to transfer restrictions but otherwise generally on the same terms as the public warrants, (iii) warrants to purchase 15,070,986 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.10 per share, which warrants were issued in connection with the private placement of the Senior Notes, (iv) warrants to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.10 per share issued to a lender, and (v) warrants to purchase up to 1,349,294 shares of common stock upon exercise of outstanding warrants originally issued by PVGI. On March 17, 2010, the public warrants and the founding director warrants referenced above expired by their terms and are no longer deemed outstanding.. The currently outstanding Senior Notes, together with accrued interest and the premium, are convertible into 1,918,178 shares of common stock. Additionally, the issuance of up to 714,295 shares issuable upon conversion of convertible debentures originally issued by PVGI, as well as stock options and other awards pursuant to our incentive plans, will further dilute our existing stockholders' voting interest.. To the extent warrants are exercised or convertible securities converted, additional shares of common stock will be issued, which will dilute existing stockholders and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. In addition to the dilutive effects described above, the conversion or exercise of those securities would lead to a potential increase in the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our shares.. Future financings may dilute your ownership and investment or result in the issuance of additional debt.. We may seek additional equity or debt financings to allow us to meet our future growth, operating and/or capital requirements or to refinance our Senior Notes or other debt. Any equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants or other adverse terms with respect. 16. Table of Contents. to raising future capital and other financial and operational matters. We may not be able to obtain additional financing in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms when needed, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. If we fail to arrange for sufficient capital in the future, we may be required to limit or reduce the scope of our business activities until we can obtain adequate financing."
