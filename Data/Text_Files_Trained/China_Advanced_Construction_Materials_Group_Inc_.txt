[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS. Our business is subject to the risk of supplier concentration.. Our top five suppliers provide approximately 47.5% of the sourcing of the raw materials for our concrete production business for the year ended June 30, 2017. As a result of this concentration in our supply chain, our business and operations would be negatively affected if any of our key suppliers were to experience significant disruption affecting the price, quality, availability or timely delivery of their products. The partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers, or a significant adverse change in our relationship with any of these suppliers, could result in lost revenue, added costs and distribution delays that could harm our business and customer relationships. In addition, concentration in our supply chain can exacerbate our exposure to risks associated with the termination by key suppliers of our distribution agreements or any adverse change in the terms of such agreements, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.. We may experience major accidents in the course of our operations, which may cause significant property damage and personal injuries.. Significant industry-related accidents and natural disasters may cause interruptions to various parts of our operations, or could result in property or environmental damage, increase in operating expenses or loss of revenue. The occurrence of such accidents and the resulting consequences may not be covered adequately, or at all, by the insurance policies we carry. In accordance with customary practice in China, we do not carry any business interruption insurance or third party liability insurance for personal injury or environmental damage arising from accidents on our property or relating to our operations other than our automobiles. Losses or payments incurred may have a material adverse effect on our operating performance if such losses or payments are not fully insured.. Our planned expansion and technical improvement projects could be delayed or adversely affected by, among other things, failures to receive regulatory approvals, difficulties in obtaining sufficient financing, technical difficulties, or human or other resource constraints.. We intend to expand new production facilities during the next few years. The costs projected for our planned expansion and technical improvement projects and expansion may exceed those originally contemplated. Costs savings and other economic benefits expected from these projects may not materialize as a result of any such project delays, cost overruns or changes in market circumstances.. 17. To make improvements at our currently existing plant, we do not need to apply for regulatory approval. However, in order to build a new concrete plant, we will need to (i) apply for a business license from the local Administration of Industry and Commerce, (ii) apply for an Industry Qualification Certificate from the local Municipal Construction Committee, and (iii) receive environmental approval from the local Environmental Protection Bureau in the relevant district area. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain these regulatory approvals in a timely manner or at all.. Additionally, in order to construct a new concrete plant, we may need to apply for a short term loan from a local commercial bank to be used for working capital. Because the lending policies of the local commercial banks are subject to change, there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain approval for such a loan with conditions favorable to us in a timely manner or at all.. Failure to obtain intended economic benefits from these new plants and technical improvements projects, either due to cost overruns, our failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or our failure to obtain necessary loan financing on terms favorable to us could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating performances.. We cannot assure you that our growth strategy will be successful.. One of our strategies is to grow through increasing the distribution and sales of our products by penetrating existing markets in China and entering new geographic markets in China. However, many obstacles to entering such new markets exist including, but not limited to, competition from established companies in such existing markets in the China. We cannot, therefore, assure you that we will be able to successfully overcome such obstacles and establish our products in any additional markets. Our inability to implement this growth strategy successfully may have a negative impact on our growth, future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.. If we fail to effectively manage our growth and expand our operations, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.. Our future success depends on our ability to expand our business to address growth in demand for our products and services. In order to maximize potential growth in our current and potential markets, we believe that we must expand our manufacturing and marketing operations. Our ability to accomplish these goals is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including:. <U+0095> the need for additional funding to construct additional manufacturing facilities, which we may be unable to obtain on reasonable terms or at all;. <U+0095> delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors, many of which may be beyond our control, such as problems with equipment vendors and manufacturing services provided by third-party manufacturers or subcontractors;. <U+0095> our receipt of any necessary government approvals or permits that may be required to expand our operations in a timely manner or at all;. <U+0095> diversion of significant management attention and other resources; and. <U+0095> failure to execute our expansion plan effectively.. To accommodate our growth, we will need to implement a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems, procedures, and controls, including improvements to our accounting and other internal management systems, by dedicating additional resources to our reporting and accounting function, and improvements to our record keeping and contract tracking system. We will also need to recruit more personnel and train and manage our growing employee base. Furthermore, our management will be required to maintain and expand our relationships with our existing customers and find new customers for our services. There is no guarantee that our management can succeed in maintaining and expanding these relationships.. If we encounter any of the risks described above, or if we are otherwise unable to establish or successfully operate additional capacity or increase our output, we may be unable to grow our business and revenues, reduce our operating costs, maintain our competitiveness or improve our profitability and, consequently, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects will be adversely affected.. 18. If we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks or costs associated with a project on which we are bidding on, we may achieve a profit lower than anticipated or even incur a loss on the contract.. Substantially all of our revenues and contract backlog are typically derived from fixed unit price contracts. Fixed unit price contracts require us to perform the contract for a fixed unit price irrespective of our actual costs. As a result, we realize a profit on these contracts only if we successfully estimate our costs and then successfully control actual costs and avoid cost overruns. If our cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if we do not execute the contract within our cost estimates, then cost overruns may cause the contract not to be as profitable as we expected, or may cause us to incur losses. This, in turn, could negatively affect our cash flow, earnings and financial position.. The costs incurred and gross profit realized on those contracts can vary, sometimes substantially, from the original projections due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:. <U+0095>              onsite conditions that differ from those assumed in the       original bid;       <U+0095>              delays caused by weather conditions;       <U+0095>              later contract start dates than expected when we bid on       the contract;       <U+0095>              contract modifications creating unanticipated costs not       covered by change orders;       <U+0095>              changes in availability, proximity and costs of       materials, including steel, concrete, aggregate and other construction       materials (such as stone, gravel and sand), as well as fuel and lubricants       for our equipment;       <U+0095>              availability and skill level of workers in the geographic       location of a project;       <U+0095>              our suppliers' or subcontractors' failure to perform;           <U+0095>              fraud or theft committed by our employees;       <U+0095>              mechanical problems with our machinery or equipment;           <U+0095>              citations issued by governmental authorities       <U+0095>              difficulties in obtaining required governmental permits       or approvals;       <U+0095>              changes in applicable laws and regulations; and       <U+0095>              claims or demands from third parties alleging damages       arising from our work or from the project of which our work is part.. Economic downturns or reductions in government funding of infrastructure projects could significantly reduce our revenues.. Our business is highly dependent on the amount of infrastructure work funded by various governmental entities, which, in turn, depends on the overall condition of the economy, the need for new or replacement infrastructure, the priorities placed on various projects funded by governmental entities and national or local government spending levels. Decreases in government funding of infrastructure projects could decrease the number of civil construction contracts available and limit our ability to obtain new contracts, which could reduce our revenues and profits.. The worldwide recession and credit crisis could impact our business.. The tightening of credit in financial markets and the general economic downturn could adversely affect the ability of our customers, and suppliers to obtain the financing they need to make purchases from us, to perform their obligations under agreements with us or even to continue their operations. The credit tightening and decreased cash availability could also result in an increase in cancellation of orders for our products and services and/or a decrease in demand for our products and services in the markets in which we operate. While we believe that the effects of the recession and credit crisis have abated, we are unable to predict potential future economic conditions and disruptions in financial markets or their effect on our business and results of operations, and the consequences may be materially adverse.. 19. Our concrete production plant in Beijing may be subject to a general city rezoning plan which, if implemented in the future, may require us to relocate or possibly permanently shut down certain of this plant.. Our concrete production plant in Beijing may be subject to a general city rezoning plan which has been prepared by the Beijing municipal government. Under the rezoning plan, it is intended that the properties where this plant is located will be rezoned from industrial to commercial use. If and when implemented in respect of those properties, the rezoning plan may require us to vacate these properties and relocate the plant. In the event we are required to vacate the above properties, we would implement certain strategies to minimize any loss of production capacity during relocation. There can be no assurance that our strategies to deal with the relocation of the facilities can be implemented, or that such strategies can be implemented before we are required to vacate the above properties due to the proposed general city rezoning plan. If we are required to relocate the facilities, our results of operation and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.. Our exposure to financially troubled customers or suppliers could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.. We produce, sell and deliver ready-mix concrete, and rely on suppliers, that have in the past and may in the future experience financial difficulty, particularly in light of recent conditions in the credit markets and the overall economy that affected access to capital and liquidity. As a result, we devote significant resources to monitor receivables and inventory balances with certain of our customers. If our customers experience financial difficulty, we could have difficulty recovering amounts owed to us from these customers, or demand for our services from these customers could decline. Furthermore, the government tightened monetary policy in order to regulate inflation, which in turn led to delayed payment on our housing construction projects. Due to concern over inflation, the Chinese government began to tighten its monetary policy from October of 2010, which affected the real estate and construction industries adversely. As a result, our accounts receivable increased and the provision for doubtful accounts expense also increased. Some of our customers appeared to suffer from declining business and shortage in cash. The allowance for doubtful accounts increased to approximately $15.8 million as of June 30, 2017, compared to approximately $11.5 million as of June 30, 2016. In fact, our provision for doubtful accounts, as a percentage of our overall accounts receivable, has increased from approximately 22% as of June 30, 2016, to approximately 25% as of June 30, 2017. The inability to collect on our outstanding accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating cash flows and reduce our working capital. As a result, we may suffer material write-offs on our accounts receivable. The inability of our suppliers to supply us with needed raw material could adversely affect our production process and therefore, we may not be able to fulfill our contract arrangements with customers.. We rely on internal models to manage risk, to provide accounting estimates and to make other business decisions. Our results could be adversely affected if those models do not provide reliable estimates or predictions of future activity.. We rely heavily on internal models in making a variety of decisions crucial to the successful operation of our business, including allowances for doubtful accounts and other accounting estimates. It is therefore important that our models are accurate, and any failure in this regard could have a material adverse effect on our results. Models are inherently imperfect predictors of actual results because they are based on historical data available to us and our assumptions about factors such as credit demand, payment rates, default rates, delinquency rates and other factors that may overstate or understate future experience. Our models could produce unreliable results for a number of reasons, including the limitations of historical data to predict results due to unprecedented events or circumstances, invalid or incorrect assumptions underlying the models, the need for manual adjustments in response to rapid changes in economic conditions, incorrect coding of the models, incorrect data being used by the models or inappropriate application of a model to products or events outside of the model's intended use. In particular, models are less dependable when the economic environment is outside of historical experience, as has been the case recently. Due to the factors described above and in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\", we may, among other things, experience actual charge-offs that exceed our estimates and which are possibly greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, or which require material adjustments to the allowance. Unanticipated and excessive default and charge-off experience can adversely affect our profitability and financial condition and adversely affect our ability to finance our business.. 20. Our business will be damaged if project contracts with the Chinese government, for which we may act as a subcontractor are cancelled.. We do not enter into any contracts directly with the Chinese government. For contracts that are funded by the Chinese government, we place bids and enter into subcontracts with the private entity prime contractor. A sudden cancellation of a prime contract, and in turn our subcontract, could cause our equipment and work crews to remain idle for a significant period of time until other comparable work becomes available. This idle time could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. Our industry is highly competitive, with numerous larger companies with greater resources competing with us, and our failure to compete effectively could reduce the number of new contracts awarded to us or adversely affect our margins on contracts awarded.. Our competition includes a number of state-owned and large private PRC-based manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours. We compete primarily on the basis of quality, technological innovation and price. Essentially all of the contracts on which we bid are awarded through a competitive bid process, with awards generally being made to the lowest bidder, though other factors such as shorter schedules or prior experience with the customer are often just as important. Within our markets, we compete with many national, regional and local state-owned and private construction firms. Some of these competitors have achieved greater market penetration or have greater financial and other resources than us. In addition, there are a number of larger national companies in our industry that could potentially establish a presence in our markets and compete with us for contracts. As a result, we may need to accept lower contract margins in order to compete against these competitors. If we are unable to compete successfully in our markets, our relative market share and profits could be reduced.. We could face increased competition in our principal market.. Our principal market, Beijing, has enjoyed stronger economic growth and a higher demand for construction than other regions of China. As a result, we believe that competitors will try to expand their sales and build up their distribution networks in our principal market. We anticipate that this trend will continue and likely accelerate. Increased competition may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. Our dependence on subcontractors and suppliers of materials could increase our costs and impair our ability to compete on contracts on a timely basis or at all, which would adversely affect our profits and cash flow.. We rely on third-party subcontractors to perform some of the work on many of our contracts. We do not bid on contracts unless we have the necessary subcontractors committed for the anticipated scope of the contract and at prices that we have included in our bid. Therefore, to the extent that we cannot obtain third-party subcontractors, our profits and cash flow will suffer.. We may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that we violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or Chinese anti-corruption law could have a material adverse effect on our business.. We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act, or FCPA, and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Chinese anti-corruption law also strictly prohibits bribery of government officials. We have operations, agreements with third parties and make sales in China, where corruption may occur. Our activities in China create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of the employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors of our Company, even though these parties are not always subject to our control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to prevent these practices by our employees. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and the employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors of our Company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible.. Violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the United States government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.. 21. We depend heavily on key personnel, and turnover of key employees and senior management could harm our business.. Our future business and results of operations depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our key technical and senior management personnel, including Xianfu Han, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Weili He, our Vice-Chairman and interim Chief Financial Officer. They also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management, technical, operational and support personnel for our operations. If we lose a key employee, if a key employee fails to perform in his or her current position, or if we are not able to attract and retain skilled employees as needed, our business could suffer. Significant turnover in our senior management could significantly deplete the institutional knowledge held by our existing senior management team. We depend on the skills and abilities of these key employees in managing the reclamation, technical, and marketing aspects of our business, any part of which could be harmed by turnover in the future.. Certain of our existing stockholders have substantial influence over our company, and their interests may not be aligned with the interests of our other stockholders.. Our Chairman, Xianfu Han, owns approximately 22.3% of our outstanding voting securities and our Vice-Chairman, Weili He, owns approximately 15.7% of our outstanding voting securities as of June 30, 2017, in a fully-diluted share base. As a result, each have significant influence over our business, including decisions regarding mergers, consolidations, liquidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, election of directors and other significant corporate actions. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a future change of control, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and might reduce the price of our shares.. We may be exposed to uncertainty relating to our investments with various financial investment companies.. We may decide to pursue short-term or long-term investments depends on various business conditions or future developments. The level of risk associated with a particular investment or asset class varies, but investments are generally subject to market risk, default risk, Inflation risk and mortality risk. Due to these risks, investments generally subject to uncertainty of the return of proceeds and possibly principles. In addition, hedging, insurance, and other ways to manage risk are not always readily available. Any failure by the Company to collect returns or principles of its investments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We may require additional capital and we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms or at all.. We may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. If our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. Our ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including:. <U+0095>              investors' perception of, and demand for, securities of       Chinese-based companies involved in construction supply or concrete       industries;       <U+0095>              conditions of the U.S. and other capital markets in which       we may seek to raise funds;       <U+0095>              our future results of operations, financial condition and       cash flows; and       <U+0095>              economic, political and other conditions in China.. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. 22. We may be exposed to potential risks relating to our internal controls over financial reporting.. As directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or SOX 404, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company's internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports. Under current law, the auditor attestation will not be required as long as our filing status remains as a smaller reporting company, but we may cease to be a smaller reporting company in future years, in which case we will be subject to the auditor attestation requirement. We were subject to management report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, and a report of our management for the 2017 fiscal year is included under Item 9A of this annual report concluding that, as of June 30, 2017, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective. If we cannot remediate the material weakness identified in a timely manner or, if and when we are subject to the auditor attestation report requirement, we are unable to receive a positive attestation from our independent auditors with respect to our internal controls, investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.. We have limited insurance coverage for our operations in China.. The insurance industry in China is still at an early stage of development. Insurance companies in China offer limited insurance products. We have determined that the risks of disruption or liability from our business, the loss or damage to our property, including our facilities, equipment and office furniture, the cost of insuring for these risks, and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to have such insurance. As a result, we do not have any business liability, disruption, litigation or property insurance coverage for our operations in China except for insurance on some company owned vehicles. Any uninsured occurrence of loss or damage to property, or litigation or business disruption may result in the incurrence of substantial costs and the diversion of resources, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.. We may not be current in our payment of social insurance and housing accumulation fund for our employees and such shortfall may expose us to relevant administrative penalties.. The PRC laws and regulations require all employers in China to fully contribute their own portion of the social insurance premium and housing accumulation fund for their employees within a certain period of time. Failure to do so may expose the employers to make rectification for the accrued premium and fund by the relevant labor authority. Also, an administrative fine may be imposed on the employers as well as the key management members. As of June 30, 2017, Xin Ao has fully contributed the social insurance premium and housing accumulation fund according to PRC laws and regulations.. Our operations may incur substantial liabilities to comply with environmental laws and regulations.. Our concrete manufacturing operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Applicable law required that we obtain an environmental impact report and environmental approval from the environmental protection administration prior to obtaining the business license and construction enterprise qualification certificate for Xin Ao. However, the local administration of industry and commerce and the Beijing Municipal Construction Commission did not require Xin Ao to provide the environmental impact report and environmental approval, and Xin Ao has not received any notice of non-compliance nor has any fine or other penalty been assessed. However, the environmental protection administration may in the future require that Xin Ao provide the applicable report and apply for the required environment approval. Our failure to have complied with the applicable laws regarding delivery of the report may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the incurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations and the imposition of injunctive relief. Resolution of these matters may require considerable management time and expense. In addition, changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and any changes that result in more stringent or costly manufacturing, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to reach and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our industry in general and on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition.. If we are unable to realize the current assets within the normal operating cycle, the Company may not have sufficient funds to meet our working capital requirements and debt obligations as they become due.. Our business is capital intensive and highly leveraged. Debt financing in the form of short term bank loans, loans from related parties and bank acceptance notes, have been utilized to finance the working capital requirements and the capital expenditures of the Company. There are a number of factors, such as the demand for the Company's products, economic conditions, the competitive pricing in the concrete-mix industry, the Company's operating results not continuing to deteriorate and the Company's bank and shareholders being able to provide continued support, might result in insufficient funds to meet our working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations. Due to recurring losses, the Company's working capital was approximately $7.5 million as of June 30, 2017 as compared to $16.4 million as of June 30, 2016. As of June 30, 2017, cash on-hand balance of approximately $0.2 million and restricted cash balance of approximately $4.2 million with the remaining current assets are mainly composed of accounts receivables and prepayments and advances. If we fail to realize the current assets within the normal operating cycle, or if we are otherwise unable to establish other available funds, we may not have sufficient funds to meet our working capital requirements and debt obligations, grow our business and revenues, reduce our operating costs and, consequently, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects will be adversely affected.. 23. RISKS RELATED TO DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA. In order to comply with PRC regulatory requirements, we operate our businesses through companies with which we have contractual relationships but in which we do not have controlling ownership. If the PRC government determines that our agreements with these companies are not in compliance with applicable regulations, our business in the PRC could be materially adversely affected.. We do not have direct or indirect equity ownership of our variable interest entity, or VIE, Xin Ao, which operates all our businesses in China. At the same time, however, we have entered into contractual arrangements with Xin Ao and its individual owners pursuant to which we received an economic interest in, and exert a controlling influence over Xin Ao, in a manner substantially similar to a controlling equity interest.. Although we believe that our current business operations are in compliance with the current laws in China, we cannot be sure that the PRC government would view our operating arrangements to be in compliance with PRC regulations that may be adopted in the future. There have been recent reports of potential PRC government efforts to regulate or perhaps limit the use of VIE structures for new foreign investment, particularly in the internet and other telecommunications industries. We are monitoring developments in this area and do not believe any adverse impact on our operations is likely.. If we are determined not to be in compliance with future PRC regulations, the PRC government could levy fines, revoke our business and operating licenses, require us to discontinue or restrict our operations, restrict our right to collect revenues, require us to restructure our business, corporate structure or operations, impose additional conditions or requirements with which we may not be able to comply, impose restrictions on our business operations or on our customers, or take other regulatory or enforcement actions against us that could be harmful to our business. As a result, our business in the PRC could be materially adversely affected.. A slowdown or other adverse developments in the PRC economy may materially and adversely affect our customers, demand for our services and our business.. We are a holding company. All of our operations are conducted in the PRC and all of our revenues are generated from sales in the PRC.. According to several articles published by the Wall Street Journal, CNN, and BBC News in January 2016, after experiencing rapid growth for more than a decade, China's economy has been hit by shrinking foreign and domestic demand, weak investment, factory overcapacity and oversupply in the property market, and has experienced a painful slowdown in the last two years. In 2016, China's economy grew by 6.7%, compared with 6.9% a year earlier, marking its slowest growth in a quarter of a century. As the government tried to shift the growth engine away from manufacturing and debt-fueled investment toward the services sector and consumer spending, the outlook of the Chinese economy is uncertain.. In the next two to three years, China's growth performance could deteriorate because of the overhang of its real estate bubble, massive manufacturing overcapacity, and the lack of new growth engines. The International Monetary Fund expected China's economy to grow by 6.5% in 2017. If China's economy is further slowing down, it may negatively affect our business operation and financial results.. We rely on contractual arrangements with our VIEs for our operations, which may not be as effective in providing control over these entities as direct ownership.. Our operations and financial results are dependent on our VIEs, Xin Ao and its subsidiaries, in which we have no equity ownership interest and must rely on contractual arrangements to control and operate the businesses of our VIEs. These contractual arrangements are not as effective in providing control over the VIEs as direct ownership. For example, the VIEs may be unwilling or unable to perform its contractual obligations under our commercial agreements. Consequently, we would not be able to conduct our operations in the manner currently planned. In addition, the VIEs may seek to renew their agreements on terms that are disadvantageous to us. Although we have entered into a series of agreements that provide us with substantial ability to control the VIEs, we may not succeed in enforcing our rights under them insofar as our contractual rights and legal remedies under PRC law are inadequate. In addition, if we are unable to renew these agreements on favorable terms when these agreements expire or enter into similar agreements with other parties, our business may not be able to operate or expand, and our operating expenses may significantly increase.. 24. In addition, the VIE structure is subject to uncertainty amid the PRC's changing legislative practice. In January 2015, China's Ministry of Commerce unveiled a draft legislation that could change how the government is regulating corporate structures, especially for VIEs controlled by foreign investments. Instead of looking at \"ownership\", the draft law focused on the entities or individuals hold control of a VIE. If a VIE is deemed to be controlled by foreign investors, it may be barred from operating in restricted sectors or the prohibited sectors listed on a \"negative list\", where only companies controlled by Chinese nationals could operate, even if structured as VIEs.. In the event that the draft law is implemented in any form, and that the Company's business is characterized as one of the \"restricted\" or \"prohibited\" sectors, Xin Ao and its subsidiaries may be barred from operation which will materially adversely affect our business.. If we become directly subject to the recent scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity involving certain U.S.-listed Chinese companies, we may have to expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matter which could harm our business operations, stock price and reputation and could result in a loss of your investment in our stock, especially if such matter cannot be addressed and resolved quickly.. Recently, U.S. public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China, particularly companies like us which have completed so-called reverse merger transactions, have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity by investors, short sellers, financial commentators and regulatory agencies, such as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Much of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity has centered around financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, a lack of effective internal controls over financial accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed Chinese companies has sharply decreased in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits, SEC enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what affect this sector-wide scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity will have on our company, our business and our stock price. If we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend our company. This situation could be costly and time consuming and distract our management from growing our company. If such allegations are not proven to be groundless, our company and business operations will be severely impacted and your investment in our stock could be rendered worthless.. Adverse changes in political and economic policies of the PRC government could impede the overall economic growth of China, which could reduce the demand for our products and damage our business.. We conduct all of our operations and generate all of our revenue in China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are affected significantly by economic, political and legal developments in China. The PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including:. <U+0095>             the higher level of government involvement;       <U+0095>             the early stage of development of the market-oriented       sector of the economy;       <U+0095>             the rapid growth rate;       <U+0095>             the higher level of control over foreign exchange; and             <U+0095>             the allocation of resources.. As the PRC economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy, the PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. While these measures may benefit the overall PRC economy, they may also have a negative effect on us.. Although the PRC government has in recent years implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the PRC government continues to exercise significant control over economic growth in China through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and imposing policies that impact particular industries or companies in different ways.. 25. Any adverse change in the economic conditions or government policies in China could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth and the level of new construction investments and expenditures in China, which in turn could lead to a reduction in demand for our services and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.. Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us.. We conduct substantially all of our business through our operating subsidiary in the PRC. Our operating subsidiaries are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws applicable to foreign-invested enterprises. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, a series of new PRC laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, since the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involve uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to you and us. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In addition, all of our executive officers and almost all of our directors are residents of China and not of the United States, and substantially all the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it could be difficult for investors to affect service of process in the United States or to enforce a judgment obtained in the United States against our Chinese operations and subsidiaries.. The PRC government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities.. The PRC government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations.. Accordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties or joint ventures.. Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our sales revenue effectively.. Most of our sales revenue and expenses are denominated in RMB. Under PRC law, the RMB is currently convertible under the \"current account,\" which includes dividends and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the \"capital account,\" which includes foreign direct investment and loans. Currently, our PRC operating subsidiary may purchase foreign currencies for settlement of current account transactions, including payments of dividends to us, without the approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, the relevant PRC government authorities may limit or eliminate our ability to purchase foreign currencies in the future. Since a significant amount of our future revenue will be denominated in RMB, any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize revenue generated in RMB to fund our business activities outside China that are denominated in foreign currencies.. Foreign exchange transactions by PRC operating subsidiaries under the capital account continue to be subject to significant foreign exchange controls and require the approval of or need to register with PRC government authorities, including SAFE. In particular, if our PRC operating subsidiaries borrow foreign currency through loans from us or other foreign lenders, these loans must be registered with SAFE, and if we finance the subsidiaries by means of additional capital contributions, these capital contributions must be approved by certain government authorities, including the Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, or their respective local counterparts. These limitations could affect their ability to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing.. 26. We may be unable to complete a business combination transaction efficiently or on favorable terms due to complicated merger and acquisition regulations implemented on September 8, 2006.. The recent PRC Regulation on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors also governs the approval process by which a PRC company may participate in an acquisition of its assets or its equity interests. Depending on the structure of the transaction, the new regulation will require the Chinese parties to make a series of applications and supplemental applications to the government agencies. In some instances, the application process may require the presentation of economic data concerning a transaction, including appraisals of the target business and evaluations of the acquirer, which are designed to allow the government to assess the transaction. Government approvals will have expiration dates by which a transaction must be completed and reported to the government agencies. Compliance with the new regulations is likely to be more time consuming and expensive than in the past and the government can now exert more control over the combination of two businesses. Accordingly, due to the new regulation, our ability to engage in business combination transactions has become significantly more complicated, time consuming and expensive, and we may not be able to negotiate a transaction that is acceptable to our stockholders or sufficiently protect their interests in a transaction.. The new regulation allows PRC government agencies to assess the economic terms of a business combination transaction. Parties to a business combination transaction may have to submit to MOFCOM and the other government agencies an appraisal report, an evaluation report and the acquisition agreement, all of which form part of the application for approval, depending on the structure of the transaction. The regulations also prohibit a transaction at an acquisition price obviously lower than the appraised value of the Chinese business or assets and in certain transaction structures, require that consideration must be paid within defined periods, generally not in excess of a year. The regulation also limits our ability to negotiate various terms of the acquisition, including aspects of the initial consideration, contingent consideration, holdback provisions, indemnification provisions and provisions relating to the assumption and allocation of assets and liabilities. Transaction structures involving trusts, nominees and similar entities are prohibited. Therefore, such regulation may impede our ability to negotiate and complete a business combination transaction on financial terms that satisfy our investors and protect our stockholders' economic interests.. Fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business and the value of our securities.. The value of our common stock will be indirectly affected by the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollars and RMB and between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated. Because substantially all of our earnings and cash assets are denominated in RMB, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the RMB will affect our balance sheet and our earnings per share in U.S. dollars. In addition, appreciation or depreciation in the value of the RMB relative to the U.S. dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations. Fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we issue that will be exchanged into U.S. dollars and earnings from, and the value of, any U.S. dollar-denominated investments we make in the future. From June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2017, the PRC Government devalued its currency by approximately 2.1%, represented the largest yuan depreciation for 20 years. China weakened the value of RMB currency by 2.1% to 6.78 against the US dollar on June 30, 2017 from 6.64 against the US dollar on June 30, 2016. Concerns remain that China's slowing economy, and in particular its exports, will need a stimulus that can only come from further cuts in the exchange rate.. Very limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In addition, our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currencies.. Currently, some of our raw materials and major equipment are imported. In the event that the U.S. dollars appreciate against RMB, our costs will increase. If we cannot pass the resulting costs on to our customers, our profitability and operating results will suffer.. 27. Under the Current Enterprise Income Tax, or EIT, Law, we may be classified as a \"resident enterprise\" of China. Such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC stockholders.. We are a holding company incorporated under the laws of Nevada. We conduct substantially all of our business through our wholly-owned and other consolidated entities in China, and we derive all of our income from these entities. Prior to January 1, 2008, dividends derived by foreign enterprises from business operations in China were not subject to the Chinese enterprise income tax. However, such tax exemption ceased as of January 1, 2008 and thereafter with the effectiveness of the new Enterprise Income Tax Law, or EIT Law.. Under the EIT Law, if we are not deemed to be a \"resident enterprise\" for Chinese tax purposes, a withholding tax at the rate of 10% would be applicable to any dividends paid by our Chinese subsidiaries to us. However, if we are deemed to be a \"resident enterprise\" established outside of China whose \"place of effective management\" is located in China, we would be classified as a resident enterprise for Chinese tax purposes and thus would be subject to an enterprise income tax rate of 25% on all of our income, including interest income on the proceeds from this offering on a worldwide basis.. The regulations promulgated pursuant to the EIT Law define the term \"place of effective management\" as \"establishments that carry out substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel, accounting, properties, etc. of an enterprise.\" The State Administration of Taxation issued a SAT Circular 82 on April 22, 2009, which provides that the \"place of effective management\" of a Chinese-controlled overseas-incorporated enterprise is located in China if the following requirements are satisfied: (i) the senior management and core management departments in charge of its daily operations function are mainly located in the PRC; (ii) its financial and human resources decisions are subject to determination or approval by persons or bodies located in the PRC; (iii) its major assets, accounting books, company seals, and minutes and files of its board and shareholders' meetings are located or kept in the PRC; and (iv) no less than half of the enterprise's directors or senior management with voting rights reside in the PRC. SAT Circular 82 applies only to overseas registered enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises, not to those controlled by PRC individuals. If the Company's non-PRC incorporated entities are deemed PRC tax residents, such entities would be subject to PRC tax under the EIT Law. The Company has analyzed the applicability of the EIT Law and related regulations, and for each of the applicable periods presented, the Company has not accrued for PRC tax on such basis.. In addition, although under the EIT Law and the related regulations dividends paid to us by our PRC subsidiaries would qualify as \"tax-exempted income,\" we cannot assure you that such dividends will not be subject to a 10% withholding tax, as the PRC foreign exchange control authorities, which enforce the withholding tax, have not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as resident enterprises for PRC enterprise income tax purposes. As a result of such changes, our historical operating results will not be indicative of our operating results for future periods and the value of our shares of common stock may be adversely affected. We are actively monitoring the possibility of \"resident enterprise\" treatment and are evaluating appropriate organizational changes to avoid this treatment, to the extent possible.. We may be subject to fines and legal sanctions if we or our Chinese employees fail to comply with PRC regulations relating to employee stock options granted by overseas listed companies to PRC citizens.. On December 25, 2006, the People's Bank of China issued the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control, and its Implementation Rules were issued by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (\"SAFE\") on January 5, 2007. Both took effect on February 1, 2007. Under these regulations, all foreign exchange matters involved in an employee stock holding plan, stock option plan or similar plan in which PRC citizens' participation requires approval from the SAFE or its authorized branch. On March 28, 2007, the SAFE issued the Application Procedure for Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Employee Stock Holding Plans or Stock Option Plans of Overseas Listed Companies, or Notice 78. Under Notice 78, PRC individuals who participate in an employee stock option holding plan or a stock option plan of an overseas listed company are required, through a PRC domestic agent or PRC subsidiary of the overseas listed company, to register with the SAFE and complete certain other procedures. We and our Chinese employees who have been granted shares or stock options pursuant to our share incentive plan are subject to Notice 78. However, in practice, there are significant uncertainties with regard to the interpretation and implementation of Notice 78. We are committed to complying with the requirements of Notice 78. However, we cannot provide any assurance that we or our Chinese employees will be able to qualify for or obtain any registration required by Notice 78. In particular, if we and/or our Chinese employees fail to comply with the provisions of Notice 78, we and/or our Chinese employees may be subject to fines and legal sanctions imposed by the SAFE or other PRC government authorities, as a result of which our business operations and employee option plans could be materially and adversely affected.. 28. The discontinuation, reduction or delay of any of the preferential tax treatments currently available to us in the PRC could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Prior to January 1, 2008, under the old enterprises income tax law, Xin Ao was subject to a 33% income tax rate, which was subject to certain tax holidays and preferential tax rates. Under the new enterprise income tax law effective January 1, 2008, or the EIT Law, both foreign-invested enterprises and domestic enterprises are subject to a unified 25% income tax rate. Under the EIT Law, preferential tax treatments will be granted to enterprises that conduct business in certain encouraged sectors and to enterprises that qualify as \"high and new technology enterprises\", a status reassessed every three years. In addition, an enterprise is entitled to a 0% value-added tax rate if it uses recycled raw materials to manufacture its products. Xin Ao was recognized as a high and new technology enterprise in January 2012 and was entitled to a 15% preferential income tax rate for the three-year period ended December 2014. In addition, Xin Ao uses recycled raw materials to manufacture its products and was entitled to a 0% value-added tax (the \"VAT tax\") rate from June 2013. The favored treatment of being exempted from the VAT tax expired in June 2015, therefore, we will be subject to the 3% industry-standard rate and our value-added tax expenses increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our net income and results of operations.. RISKS RELATED TO THE MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. Our shares of common stock are very thinly traded, and there can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock in the future.. Our shares of common stock are very thinly traded, and the price if traded may not reflect our value. There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock in the future. The market liquidity will be dependent on the perception of our operating business and any steps that our management might take to bring us to the awareness of investors. There can be no assurance given that there will be any awareness generated. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business. If a more active market should develop, the price may be highly volatile. Because there may be a low price for our shares of common stock, many brokerage firms may not be willing to effect transactions in the securities. Even if an investor finds a broker willing to effect a transaction in the shares of our common stock, the combination of brokerage commissions, transfer fees, taxes, if any, and any other selling costs may exceed the selling price. Further, many lending institutions will not permit the use of such shares of common stock as collateral for any loans.. We do not intend to pay dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future, but if we intend to do so our holding company structure may limit the payment of dividends to our stockholders.. We have no direct business operations, other than our ownership of our subsidiaries. While we have no current intention of paying dividends, should we decide in the future to do so, as a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries and other holdings and investments. In addition, our operating subsidiaries, from time to time, may be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us, including as a result of restrictive covenants in loan agreements, restrictions on the conversion of local currency into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions as discussed below. If future dividends are paid in RMB, fluctuations in the exchange rate for the conversion of RMB into U.S. dollars may reduce the amount received by U.S. stockholders upon conversion of the dividend payment into U.S. dollars.. Chinese regulations currently permit the payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. Our subsidiaries in China are also required to set aside a portion of their after tax profits according to Chinese accounting standards and regulations to fund certain reserve funds. Currently, our subsidiaries in China are the only sources of revenues or investment holdings for the payment of dividends. If they do not accumulate sufficient profits under Chinese accounting standards and regulations to first fund certain reserve funds as required by Chinese accounting standards, we will be unable to pay any dividends.. 29. We may be subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock.. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called \"penny stocks\" to be an equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. If our common stock becomes a \"penny stock\", we may become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the \"Penny Stock Rule\". This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers and \"accredited investors\" (generally, individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual incomes exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouses). For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market.. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock.. There can be no assurance that our common stock will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if our common stock were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest."
