[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\") could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties. An investment in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto before making an investment decision. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline and you could lose some or all of your investment.. We have grouped our risks according to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisks Related to Our Business and Industry;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock.. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry. Our results are tied to the residential real estate market and we may be negatively impacted by downturns in this market and general global economic conditions.. The residential real estate market tends to be cyclical and typically is affected by changes in general economic conditions which are beyond our control. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, levels of unemployment, consumer confidence and the general condition of the U.S. and the global economy. The residential real estate market also depends upon the strength of financial institutions, which are sensitive to changes in the general macroeconomic and regulatory environment. Lack of available credit or lack of confidence in the financial sector could impact the residential real estate market, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. For example, the U.S. residential real estate market has steadily improved in recent years after a significant and prolonged downturn, which began in the second half of 2005 and continued through 2011. Based on our experience, we believe gradually improving market conditions in the U.S. will enable us to continue to recruit and retain more agents, increasing our revenue and profitability.. 25. Table of Contents. We cannot predict whether the market will continue to improve. If the residential real estate market or the economy as a whole does not continue to improve, we may experience adverse effects on our business, financial condition and liquidity, including our ability to access capital and grow our business.. Any of the following could cause a decline in the housing or mortgage markets and have a material adverse effect on our business by causing periods of lower growth or a decline in the number of home sales and/or home prices which, in turn, could adversely affect our revenue and profitability:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tan increase in the unemployment rate;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta decrease in the affordability of homes due to changes in interest rates, home prices, and rates of wage and job growth;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tslow economic growth or recessionary conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tweak credit markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlow consumer confidence in the economy and/or the residential real estate market;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinstability of financial institutions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlegislative, tax or regulatory changes that would adversely impact the residential real estate or mortgage markets, including but not limited to potential reform relating to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other government sponsored entities (\"GSEs\") that provide liquidity to the U.S. housing and mortgage markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreasing mortgage rates and down payment requirements and/or constraints on the availability of mortgage financing, including but not limited to the potential impact of various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") or other legislation and regulations that may be promulgated thereunder relating to mortgage financing, including restrictions imposed on mortgage originators as well as retention levels required to be maintained by sponsors to securitize certain mortgages;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texcessive or insufficient home inventory levels on a regional level;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thigh levels of foreclosure activity, including but not limited to the release of homes already held for sale by financial institutions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse changes in local or regional economic conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability or unwillingness of homeowners to enter into home sale transactions due to negative equity in their existing homes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdemographic changes, such as a decrease in household formations; lower turnover in the housing market due to homeowners staying in the same home longer than in the past; slowing rate of immigration or population growth; decrease in home ownership rates, declining demand for real estate and changing social attitudes toward home ownership;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in local, state and federal laws or regulations that affect residential real estate transactions or encourage ownership, including but not limited to changes in tax law in late 2017 that limit the deductibility of certain mortgage interest expenses and increase the standard deduction (thereby potentially decreasing the tax benefits of homeownership) and potential future tax law changes, such as further limiting or eliminating the deductibility of certain mortgage interest expense, the application of the alternative minimum tax, and real property taxes and employee relocation expense; and/or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacts of nature, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters that disrupt local or regional real estate markets and which may, in some circumstances, lead us to waive certain fees in impacted areas.. 26. Table of Contents. The failure of the U.S. residential real estate market growth to be sustained, or a prolonged decline in the number of home sales and/or home sale prices could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.. The U.S. residential real estate market has gradually improved since 2011. However, not all U.S. markets have participated to the same extent in the improvement. A lack of a continued or widespread growth or a prolonged decline in existing home sales, a decline in home sale prices or a decline in commission rates charged by our franchisees/brokers could adversely affect our results of operations by impacting the number of agents in our network and reducing the recurring fees we receive from our franchisees and our agents.. A lack of financing for homebuyers in the U.S. residential real estate market at favorable rates and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations.. Our business is significantly impacted by the availability of financing at favorable rates or on favorable terms for homebuyers, which may be affected by government regulations and policies. Certain potential reforms such as the U.S. federal government's conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, proposals to reform the U.S. housing market, attempts to increase loan modifications for homeowners with negative equity, monetary policy of the U.S. government, increases in interest rates and the Dodd-Frank Act may adversely impact the housing industry, including homebuyers' ability to finance and purchase homes.. The monetary policy of the U.S. government, and particularly the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S., significantly affects the availability of financing at favorable rates and on favorable terms, which in turn affects the domestic real estate market. Policies of the Federal Reserve Board can affect interest rates available to potential homebuyers. Further, we are affected by any rising interest rate environment. Changes in the Federal Reserve Board's policies, the interest rate environment and mortgage market are beyond our control, are difficult to predict, and could restrict the availability of financing on reasonable terms for homebuyers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Since December 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Board has raised the target range for federal funds five times, including three times in 2017, after leaving the federal funds interest rate near zero since late 2008. The pace of future increases in the federal funds rate is uncertain, although the Federal Open Market Committee has indicated it expects additional increases to occur. Historically, changes in the federal funds rate have led to changes in interest rates for other loans but the extent of the impact on the future availability and price of mortgage financing cannot be predicted with certainty.. In addition, a reduction in government support for home financing, including the possible winding down of GSEs could further reduce the availability of financing for homebuyers in the U.S. residential real estate market. In connection with the U.S. federal government's conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, it provided billions of dollars of funding to these entities during the real estate downturn, in the form of preferred stock investments to backstop shortfalls in their capital requirements. No consensus has emerged in Congress concerning potential reforms relating to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, so we cannot predict either the short or long term effects of such regulation and its impact on homebuyers' ability to finance and purchase homes.. Furthermore, many lenders significantly tightened their underwriting standards since the real estate downturn, and many subprime and other alternative mortgage products are no longer common in the marketplace. If these mortgage loans continue to be difficult to obtain, including in the jumbo mortgage markets, the ability and willingness of prospective buyers to finance home purchases or to sell their existing homes could be adversely affected, which would adversely affect our operating results.. The Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed to more closely regulate the financial services industry, created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\"), an independent federal bureau, which enforces consumer protection laws, including various laws regulating mortgage finance. The Dodd-Frank Act also established new standards and practices for mortgage lending, including a requirement to determine a prospective borrower's ability to repay a loan, removing incentives to originate higher cost mortgages, prohibiting prepayment penalties for non-qualified mortgages, prohibiting mandatory arbitration clauses, requiring additional disclosures to potential borrowers and restricting the fees that mortgage originators may collect. Rules implementing many of these changes protect creditors from certain liabilities for loans that meet the requirements for \"qualified mortgages.\" The rules place several restrictions on qualified mortgages,. 27. Table of Contents. including caps on certain closing costs. These and other rules promulgated by the CFPB could have a significant impact on the availability of home mortgages and how mortgage brokers and lenders transact business. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act contained provisions that require GSEs, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to retain an interest in the credit risk arising from the assets they securitize. This may serve to reduce GSEs' demand for mortgage loans, which could have a material adverse effect on the mortgage industry, which may reduce the availability of mortgages to certain borrowers.. While we are continuing to evaluate all aspects of legislation, regulations and policies affecting the domestic real estate market, we cannot predict whether or not such legislation, regulation and policies may increase down payment requirements, increase mortgage costs, or result in increased costs and potential litigation for housing market participants, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. We may fail to execute our strategies to grow our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations.. We intend to pursue a number of different strategies to grow our revenue and earnings and to deploy the cash generated by our business. We constantly strive to increase the value proposition for our agents and brokers. If we do not reinvest in our business in ways that support our agents and brokers and make the RE/MAX network attractive to agents and brokers, we may become less competitive. Additionally, we are exploring opportunities to acquire other businesses, including select RE/MAX independent regional franchises, or other businesses in the U.S. and Canada that are complementary to our core business. If we fail to develop, execute, or focus on our business strategy, fail to make good business decisions, fail to enforce a disciplined management process to ensure that our investment of resources aligns with our strategic plan and our core management and franchising competencies or fail to properly focus resources or management attention on strategic areas, any of these could negatively impact the overall value of the Company. If we are unable to execute our business strategy, for these or any other reasons, our prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed and our stock price may decline.. We may be unable to reacquire regional franchise rights in independent RE/MAX regions in the U.S. and Canada or successfully integrate the independent RE/MAX regions that we have acquired.. We are pursuing a key growth strategy of reacquiring select RE/MAX independent regional franchises in the U.S. and Canada. The reacquisition of a regional franchise increases our revenue and provides an opportunity for us to drive enhanced profitability. This growth strategy depends on our ability to find regional franchisees willing to sell the franchise rights in their regions on favorable terms, as well as our ability to finance and complete these transactions. The number of remaining independent regions in the United States and Canada is limited and therefore we may have difficulty finding suitable regional franchise acquisition opportunities at an acceptable price. Further, in the event we acquire a regional franchise, we may not be able to achieve the expected returns on our acquisition after we integrate the reacquired region into our business.. Integrating acquired regions involves complex operational and personnel-related challenges and we may encounter unforeseen difficulties and higher than expected integration costs or we may not be able to deliver expected cost and growth synergies.. Future acquisitions may present other challenges and difficulties, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe possible departure of a significant number of key employees;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory constraints and costs of executing our growth strategy may vary by geography;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe possible defection of franchisees and agents to other brands or independent real estate companies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe disruption of our respective ongoing business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimits on growth due to exclusive territories granted by former region owners;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproblems we may discover post-closing with the operations, including the internal controls and procedures of. 28. Table of Contents. the regions we reacquire;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe failure to maintain important business relationships and contracts of the selling region;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timpairment of acquired assets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlegal or regulatory challenges or litigation post-acquisition, which could result in significant costs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunanticipated expenses related to integration; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses.. A prolonged diversion of management's attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of any acquired region or region that we may acquire in the future could prevent us from realizing anticipated cost savings and revenue growth from our acquisitions.. We may not be able to manage growth successfully.. In order to successfully expand our business, we must effectively recruit, develop and motivate new franchisees, and we must maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. We may not be able to hire new employees with the expertise necessary to manage our growth quickly enough to meet our needs. If we fail to effectively manage our hiring needs and successfully develop our franchisees, our franchisee and employee morale, productivity and retention could suffer, and our brand and results of operations could be harmed. Effectively managing our potential growth could require significant capital expenditures and place increasing demands on our management. We may not be successful in managing or expanding our operations or in maintaining adequate financial and operating systems and controls. If we do not successfully manage these processes, our brand and results of operations could be adversely affected.. The failure to attract and retain highly qualified franchisees could compromise our ability to expand the RE/MAX network.. Our most important asset is the people in our network, and the success of our franchisees depends largely on the efforts and abilities of franchisees to attract and retain high quality agents. If our franchisees fail to attract and retain agents, they may fail to generate the revenue necessary to pay the contractual fees owed to us.. Additionally, although we believe our relationship with our franchisees and agents is open and strong, the nature of such relationships can give rise to conflict. For example, franchisees or agents may become dissatisfied with the amount of contractual fees and dues owed under franchise or other applicable arrangements, particularly in the event that we decide to increase fees and dues further. They may disagree with certain network-wide policies and procedures, including policies such as those dictating brand standards or affecting their marketing efforts. They may also be disappointed with any marketing campaigns designed to develop our brand. There are a variety of reasons why our franchisor-franchisee relationship can give rise to conflict. If we experience any conflicts with our franchisees on a large scale, our franchisees may decide not to renew their franchise agreements upon expiration or may file lawsuits against us or they may seek to disaffiliate with us, which could also result in litigation. These events may, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.. Our financial results are affected by the ability of our franchisees to attract and retain agents.. Our financial results are heavily dependent upon the number of agents in our global network. The majority of our revenue is derived from recurring dues paid by our agents and contractual fees paid by our franchisees or regional franchise owners based on the number of agents within the franchisee's or regional franchise owner's network. Competition for real estate agents is fierce. If our franchisees are not able to attract and retain agents (which is not within our direct control), our revenue may decline. In addition, our competitors may attempt to recruit the agents of our franchisees.. 29. Table of Contents. Competition in the residential real estate franchising business is intense, and we may be unable to grow our business organically, including increasing our agent count, expanding our network of franchises and agents, and increasing franchise and agent fees, which could adversely affect our brand, our financial performance, and results of operations.. We generally face strong competition in the residential real estate services business from other franchisors and brokerages (i.e. national, regional, independent, boutique, discount and web-based brokerages), as well as web-based companies focused on real estate. There has recently been substantial capital investment in real estate technology, including companies aiming to use innovative technology to disrupt the real estate industry. As a real estate brokerage franchisor, one of our primary assets is our brand name. Upon the expiration of a franchise agreement, a franchisee may choose to renew their franchise with us, operate as an independent broker or to franchise with one of our competitors. Competing franchisors may offer franchises monthly ongoing fees that are lower than those we charge, or that are more attractive in particular market environments. Further, our largest competitors in this industry in the U.S. and Canada include the brands operated by Realogy Holdings, Corp., (which include Coldwell Banker, Century 21, ERA, Sotheby's and Better Homes and Gardens, among others), Berkshire Hathaway Home Services, Keller Williams Realty, Inc. and Royal LePage. Some of these companies may have greater financial resources and larger budgets than we do to invest in technology to build their brands and enhance their value proposition to agents, brokers and consumers. To remain competitive in the sale of franchises and to retain our existing franchisees at the time of the renewal of their franchise agreements, we may have to reduce the cost of renewals and/or the recurring monthly fees we charge our franchisees. Further, in certain areas, regional and local franchisors provide additional competitive pressure.. As a result of this competition, we may face many challenges in achieving organic growth by adding franchises and attracting agents in new and existing markets to expand our network in the U.S., Canada and globally, as well as other challenges such as:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tselection and availability of suitable markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfinding qualified franchisees in these markets who are interested in opening franchises on terms that are favorable to us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreasing our local brand awareness in new markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tattracting and training of qualified local agents; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic and business conditions.. A significant adoption by consumers of online alternatives to full-service agents could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and results of operations.. A significant increase in consumer use of technology that eliminates or minimizes the role of the real estate agent could have a materially adverse effect on our business, prospects and results of operations. These options include cloud-based competitors such as direct-buyer companies that purchase directly from the seller, and online discounters who reduce the role of the agent in order to offer sellers a low commission or a flat fee while giving rebates to buyers. How consumers want to buy or sell houses will determine if these models reduce or replace the long-standing preference for full-service agents.. Our financial results are affected directly by the operating results of franchisees and agents, over whom we do not have direct control.. Our real estate franchises generate revenue in the form of monthly ongoing fees, including monthly management fees and broker fees (which are tied to agent gross commissions) charged by our franchisees to our agents. Our agents pay us annual dues to have access to our network and utilize our services. Accordingly, our financial results depend upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees and their agents, whom we do not control, particularly in Independent Regions where we exercise less control over franchisees than in Company-owned Regions. Our franchisees operate in an intensely competitive market and we have little visibility into the results of operations of our franchises. If industry trends or economic conditions are not sustained or do not continue to improve, our franchisees' financial results. 30. Table of Contents. may worsen and our revenue may decline. We may also have to terminate franchisees more frequently in the future due to non-reporting and non-payment. Further, if franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements, or if we decide to restructure franchise agreements in order to induce franchisees to renew these agreements, then our revenue from ongoing monthly fees may decrease, and profitability from new franchisees may be lower than in the past due to reduced ongoing monthly fees and other non-standard incentives we may need to provide.. Our franchisees and agents could take actions that could harm our business.. Our regional franchisees are independent businesses and the agents who work within these brokerages are independent contractors and, as such, are not our employees, and we do not exercise control over their day-to-day operations. Broker franchisees may not operate real estate brokerage businesses in a manner consistent with industry standards, or may not attract and retain qualified independent contractor agents. If broker franchisees and agents were to provide diminished quality of service to customers, engage in fraud, defalcation, misconduct or negligence or otherwise violate the law or realtor codes of ethics, our image and reputation may suffer materially and we may become subject to liability claims based upon such actions of our franchisees and agents. Any such incidence could adversely affect our results of operations.. Brand value can be severely damaged even by isolated incidents, particularly if the incidents receive considerable negative publicity or result in litigation. Some of these incidents may relate to the way we manage our relationship with our franchisees, our growth strategies or the ordinary course of our business or our franchisees' business. Other incidents may arise from events that are or may be beyond our control and may damage our brand, such as actions taken (or not taken) by one or more franchisees or their agents relating to health, safety, welfare or other matters; litigation and claims; failure to maintain high ethical and social standards for all of our operations and activities; failure to comply with local laws and regulations; and illegal activity targeted at us or others. Our brand value could diminish significantly if any such incidents or other matters erode consumer confidence in us, which may result in a decrease in our total agent count and, ultimately, lower continuing franchise fees and annual dues, which in turn would materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.. The failure of Independent Region owners to successfully develop or expand within their respective regions could adversely impact our revenue.. We have sold regional master franchises in the U.S. and Canada and have sold and continue to sell regional master franchises in our global locations outside of Canada. While we are pursuing a strategy to reacquire select regional franchise rights in a number of regions in the U.S. and Canada, we still rely on independent regional master franchises in Independent Regions, and in all regions located outside the U.S. and Canada. We derive only a limited portion of our revenue directly from master franchises. However, we depend on Independent Regions, which have the exclusive right to grant franchises within a particular region, to successfully develop or expand within their respective regions and to monitor franchisees' use of our brand. The failure of any of these Independent Region owners to do these things, or the termination of an agreement with a regional master franchisee could delay the development of a particular franchised area, interrupt the operation of our brand in a particular market or markets while we seek alternative methods to develop our franchises in the area, and weaken our brand image. Such an event could result in lower revenue for us, which would adversely impact our business and results of operations.. We are subject to a variety of additional risks associated with our franchisees.. Our franchise system subjects us to a number of risks, any one of which may impact our ability to collect recurring, contractual fees and dues from our franchisees, may harm the goodwill associated with our brand, and/or may materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations.. Bankruptcy of U.S. Franchisees. A franchisee bankruptcy could have a substantial negative impact on our ability to collect fees and dues owed under such franchisee's franchise arrangements. In a franchisee bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee may reject its franchise arrangements pursuant to Section 365 under the U.S. bankruptcy code, in which case there would be no further payments for fees and dues from such franchisee, and there can be no assurance as to the. 31. Table of Contents. proceeds, if any, that may ultimately be recovered in a bankruptcy proceeding of such franchisee in connection with a damage claim resulting from such rejection.. Franchisee Insurance. The franchise arrangements require each franchisee to maintain certain insurance types and levels. Certain extraordinary hazards, however, may not be covered, and insurance may not be available (or may be available only at prohibitively expensive rates) with respect to many other risks. Moreover, any loss incurred could exceed policy limits or the franchisee could lack the required insurance at the time the claim arises, in breach of the insurance requirement, and policy payments made to franchisees may not be made on a timely basis. Any such loss or delay in payment could have a material and adverse effect on a franchisee's ability to satisfy its obligations under its franchise arrangement, including its ability to make payments for contractual fees and dues or to indemnify us.. Franchise Arrangement Termination. Each franchise arrangement is subject to termination by us as the franchisor in the event of a default, generally after expiration of applicable cure periods, although under certain circumstances a franchise arrangement may be terminated by us upon notice without an opportunity to cure. The default provisions under the franchise arrangements are drafted broadly and include, among other things, any failure to meet operating standards and actions that may threaten the licensed intellectual property.. Franchise Nonrenewal.  Each franchise agreement has an expiration date. Upon the expiration of the franchise arrangement, we or the franchisee may or may not elect to renew the franchise arrangement. If the franchisee arrangement is renewed, such renewal is generally contingent on the franchisee's execution of the then-current form of franchise arrangement (which may include terms the franchisee deems to be more onerous than the prior franchise agreement), the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of a renewal fee. If a franchisee is unable or unwilling to satisfy any of the foregoing conditions, the expiring franchise arrangement will terminate upon expiration of the term of the franchise arrangement.. We may fail to protect the privacy and personally identifiable information of our franchisees, agents and consumers.. We rely on the collection and use of personally identifiable information from franchisees, agents and consumers to conduct our business. We disclose our information collection and dissemination practices in a published privacy statement on our websites, which we may modify from time to time. We may be subject to legal claims, government action and damage to our reputation if we act or are perceived to be acting inconsistently with the terms of our privacy statement, consumer expectations, or the law. In the event we, or the vendors with which we contract to provide services on behalf of our customers, were to suffer a breach of personally identifiable information, our customers could terminate their business with us. Further, we may be subject to claims to the extent individual employees or independent contractors breach or fail to adhere to company policies and practices and personally identifiable information is jeopardized as a result.. The real estate business of our franchisees is highly regulated and any failure to comply with such regulations or any changes in such regulations could adversely affect our business.. The businesses of our franchisees are highly regulated and must comply with the requirements governing the licensing and conduct of real estate brokerage and brokerage-related businesses in the jurisdictions in which we and they do business. These laws and regulations contain general standards for and prohibitions on the conduct of real estate brokers and agents, including those relating to licensing of brokers and agents, fiduciary and agency duties, administration of trust funds, collection of commissions, advertising and consumer disclosures. Under state law, the franchisees and our real estate brokers have certain duties to supervise and are responsible for the conduct of their brokerage business.. Our franchisees (other than in commercial brokerage transactions) must comply with RESPA. RESPA and comparable state statutes, among other things, restrict payments which real estate brokers, agents and other settlement service providers may receive for the referral of business to other settlement service providers in connection with the closing of real estate transactions. Such laws may to some extent restrict preferred vendor arrangements involving our franchisees. RESPA and similar state laws also require timely disclosure of certain relationships or financial interests that a broker has with providers of real estate settlement services. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, administration of RESPA has been moved from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 32. Table of Contents. (\"CFPB\"). The CFPB's interpretation or application of RESPA may differ from HUD's, particularly with respect to a range of informal interpretations that HUD staff provided over many years; that possibility presents an increased regulatory risk.. There is a risk that we could be adversely affected by current laws, regulations or interpretations or that more restrictive laws, regulations or interpretations will be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive. There is also a risk that a change in current laws could adversely affect our business or our franchisees' businesses.. Regulatory authorities also have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, such regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend our franchisees from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize them if their financial condition or our practices were found not to comply with the then current regulatory or licensing requirements or any interpretation of such requirements by the regulatory authority. In addition, new regulations could increase the barriers to entry for brokers and agents which may impact our ability to sell franchisees and our franchisees' ability to recruit agents. Our or our franchisees' failure to comply with regulatory requirements or interpretations could limit our ability to renew current franchisees or sign new franchisees or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations.. We, or our franchisees, are also subject to various other rules and regulations such as:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which governs the disclosure and safeguarding of consumer financial information;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvarious state and federal privacy laws protecting consumer data;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe USA PATRIOT Act;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions on transactions with persons on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfederal and state \"Do Not Call,\" \"Do Not Fax,\" and \"Do Not E-Mail\" laws;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Fair Housing Act;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlaws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that impose sanctions on improper payments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlaws and regulations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which we do business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstate and federal employment laws and regulations, including any changes that would require reclassification of independent contractors to employee status, and wage and hour regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreases in state, local or federal taxes that could diminish profitability or liquidity; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconsumer fraud statutes.. Our failure to comply with any of the foregoing laws and regulations may subject us to fines, penalties, injunctions and/or potential criminal violations. Any changes to these laws or regulations or any new laws or regulations may make it more difficult for us to operate our business and may have a material adverse effect on our operations.. Our franchising activities are subject to a variety of state and federal laws and regulations regarding franchises, and any failure to comply with such existing or future laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.. The sale of franchises is regulated by various state laws as well as by the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\"). The FTC requires that franchisors make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees but does not require registration. A number of states require registration and/or disclosure in connection with franchise offers and sales. In addition, several states have \"franchise relationship laws\" or \"business opportunity laws\" that limit the ability of franchisors to terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements. We believe that our franchising procedures, as well as any applicable state-specific procedures, comply in all material respects with both the FTC guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we offer new franchise. 33. Table of Contents. arrangements. However, noncompliance could reduce anticipated revenue, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.. Most of our franchisees self-report their agent counts, agent commissions and fees due to us, and we have limited tools to validate or verify these reports and a few of our domestic and global master franchise agreements do not contain audit rights. This could impact our ability to collect revenue owed to us by our Independent Regions, franchisees, and agents, and could affect our ability to forecast our performance accurately.. Under our franchise agreements, franchise owners, including regional owners, report the number of agents, monthly management fees and broker service fees received by the brokers from the agents and the monthly ongoing fees (continuing franchise fees and broker fees) payable to us by the brokers.  Some of our regional agreements do not provide us with audit rights. For those agreements that do not, we may have limited methods of validating the monthly ongoing fees due to us from these regions and must rely on reports submitted by such regional franchisees and our internal protocols for verifying agent counts. If franchisees were to underreport or erroneously report amounts payable, even if unintentionally, we may not receive all of the annual agent dues or monthly ongoing fees due to us. In addition, to the extent that we were underpaid, we may not have a definitive method for determining such underpayment. If a material number of our franchisees were to underreport or erroneously report their agent counts, agent commissions or fees due to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations. Further, agent count is a key performance indicator (KPI), and incomplete information, or information that is not reported in a timely manner could impair our ability to evaluate and forecast key business drivers and financial performance.. We are subject to certain risks related to litigation filed by or against us, and adverse results may harm our business and financial condition.. We cannot predict with certainty the costs of defense, the costs of prosecution, insurance coverage or the ultimate outcome of litigation and other proceedings filed by or against us, including remedies or damage awards, and adverse results in such litigation and other proceedings may harm our business and financial condition.. Such litigation and other proceedings may include, but are not limited to, securities litigation including class actions and shareholder derivative litigation, complaints from or litigation by franchisees, usually related to alleged breaches of contract or wrongful termination under the franchise arrangements, actions relating to intellectual property, commercial arrangements and franchising arrangements.. In addition, litigation against a franchisee or its affiliated sales agents by third parties, whether in the ordinary course of business or otherwise, may also include claims against us for liability by virtue of the franchise relationship. Franchisees may fail to obtain insurance naming the Company as an additional insured on such claims. We could face similar claims for direct liability related to our former operation of Company-owned brokerages, the last of which we sold in 2015 and early 2016. In addition to increasing franchisees' costs and limiting the funds available to pay us contractual fees and dues and reducing the execution of new franchise arrangements, claims against us (including vicarious liability claims) divert our management resources and could cause adverse publicity, which may materially and adversely affect us and our brand, regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether we are liable.. Our global operations may be subject to additional risks related to litigation, including difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations governed by foreign law due to differing interpretations of rights and obligations, compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws, new and potentially untested laws and judicial systems and reduced protection of intellectual property. A substantial unsatisfied judgment against us or one of our subsidiaries could result in bankruptcy, which would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. See \"Risk Factors - We may experience legal proceedings related to the matters underlying the Special Committee investigation and such legal proceedings may result in adverse findings, the imposition of fines or other penalties, increased costs and expenses and the diversion of management's time and resources.\". 34. Table of Contents. Our global operations, including those in Canada, are subject to risks not generally experienced by our U.S. operations.. Although our global operations provide a relatively small portion of our revenue, they are subject to risks not generally experienced by our U.S. operations. The risks involved in our global operations and relationships could result in losses against which we are not insured and therefore affect our profitability. These risks include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily related to changes in the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rates, as well as the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate and foreign exchange restrictions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texposure to local economic conditions and local laws and regulations, including those relating to the agents of our franchisees;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teconomic and/or credit conditions abroad;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential adverse changes in the political stability of foreign countries or in their diplomatic relations with the U.S.;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgovernment policies against businesses owned by foreigners;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinvestment restrictions or requirements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights in foreign countries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties in registering, protecting or preserving trade names and trademarks in foreign countries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions on the ability to obtain or retain licenses required for operation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased franchise regulations in foreign jurisdictions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twithholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in foreign tax laws.. Our global operations outside Canada generally generate substantially lower average revenue per agent than our U.S. and Canadian operations.. Our business is dependent on key personnel including key members of our senior management team and loss of key individuals, or the inability to retain additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations, our brand and our financial performance.. Our senior management team has recently undergone significant changes in personnel, including the completion of transitioning the CEO role from David Liniger, who has been serving as Co-CEO and principal executive officer, to Adam Contos, who will now serve as our sole CEO and as principal executive officer.  We also recently enhanced the role of our Lead Independent Director in order to provide additional involvement by our board of directors (the \"Board of Directors\") to support the senior management team during this period of transition and to enhance our governance at the Board of Directors level in part in response to the findings of the Special Committee (as defined below).. Our future success will likely continue to depend heavily on the efforts and abilities of key personnel including our CEO, Adam Contos and other members of our senior management, other key employees and the services of our Lead Independent Director, Richard Covey. The loss of services from any of these key personnel could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. In addition, we do not maintain key employee life insurance policies on Mr. Contos or our other key employees. As a result, we may not be able to cover the financial loss we may incur in losing the services of any of these individuals.. 35. Table of Contents. In the event of the loss of the services of any of such key personnel, we may be unable to implement or execute upon our corporate succession plan due to factors including the timing of the loss relative to the development of key successor employees or the loss of those successors themselves.. Our ability to retain such key personnel and other key individuals is generally subject to numerous factors, including the compensation and benefits we pay, our ability to provide pathways for professional development and overall morale. As such, we could suffer significant attrition among these key individuals unexpectedly. Competition for qualified personnel in the real estate franchising industry is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified employees.. We only have one primary facility, which serves as our corporate headquarters.  If we encounter difficulties associated with this facility, we could face management issues that could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.. We only have one primary facility, in Denver, Colorado, which serves as our corporate headquarters where most of our employees are located. A significant portion of our computer equipment and senior management, including critical resources dedicated to financial and administrative functions, is also located at our corporate headquarters. Our management and employees would need to find an alternative location if we were to encounter difficulties at our corporate headquarters, including by fire or other natural disaster, which would cause disruption and expense to our business and operations.. We recognize the need for, and continue to develop business continuity and document retention plans that would allow us to be operational despite casualties or unforeseen events impacting our corporate headquarters. If we encounter difficulties or disasters at our corporate headquarters and our business continuity and document retention plans are not adequate, our operations and information may not be available in a timely manner, or at all, and this would have a material adverse effect on our business.. Our business depends on a strong brand, and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to grow our business, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition.. We have developed a strong brand that we believe has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Maintaining, protecting and enhancing the \"RE/MAX\" brand is critical to growing our business, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition. If we do not successfully build and maintain a strong brand, our business could be materially harmed. Maintaining and enhancing the quality of our brand may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as marketing, community relations, outreach and employee training. We actively engage in television, print and online advertisements, targeted promotional mailings and email communications, and engage on a regular basis in public relations and sponsorship activities. These investments may be substantial and may fail to encompass the optimal range of traditional, online and social advertising media to achieve maximum exposure and benefit to the brand.. Inasmuch as our business is in part dependent on a strong brand, our business may be subject to risks related to events and circumstances that have a negative impact on our brand.  If we are exposed to adverse publicity or events that do damage to our brand and/or image, our business may suffer material adverse effects from the deterioration in our brand and image.. We may be unable to obtain approval of independent regional owners to fund network wide advertising and promotional initiatives.. Regional RE/MAX master franchisees, as independent business operators, may from time to time disagree with us and our strategies regarding the business and how best to promote the RE/MAX brand on a national or network-wide basis. Both Company-owned and Independent Regions in the U.S. concentrate advertising expenditures with our respective regional advertising funds. Our focus on regional and local advertising in the U.S. may fail to leverage franchisee contributions to achieve maximum group purchasing power in our media buys, having an adverse impact on our business and results of operation in future periods. To the extent that the advertising funds in Independent Regions choose not to. 36. Table of Contents. contribute to national or pan-regional creative development and media purchases, this may reduce economies of scale in the purchase of advertising, or may result in different marketing messages being associated with the RE/MAX brand in different areas of the country.  If Independent Regions and their advertising funds choose not to invest in common technology platforms, this likewise may reduce economies of scale and may result in fragmented web presences for the RE/MAX brand in various areas of the country and less web traffic to remax.com, resulting in fewer leads to RE/MAX agents, potentially affecting our results of operations.. Loss of market leadership could weaken our brand awareness and brand reputation among consumers, agents, and brokers.. We derive significant benefit from our market share leadership and our ability to make claims regarding the same, including through use of our slogan that \"Nobody sells more real estate than RE/MAX\" as measured by residential transaction sides. Loss of market leadership, and as a result an inability to tout the same, may hinder public and industry perception of RE/MAX as a leader in the real estate industry and hurt agent recruitment and franchise sales as a result.. Infringement, misappropriation or dilution of our intellectual property could harm our business.. We regard our RE/MAX trademark, balloon logo and yard sign design trademarks as having significant value and as being an important factor in the marketing of our brand. We believe that this and other intellectual property are valuable assets that are critical to our success. Not all of the trademarks or service marks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business, and they may never be registered in all of those countries. There can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately maintain, enforce and protect our trademarks or other intellectual property rights.. We are commonly involved in numerous proceedings, generally on a small scale, to enforce our intellectual property and protect our brand. Unauthorized uses or other infringement of our trademarks or service marks, including uses that are currently unknown to us, could diminish the value of our brand and may adversely affect our business. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every market. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could damage our brand and impair our ability to compete effectively. Even where we have effectively secured statutory protection for our trademarks and other intellectual property, our competitors may misappropriate our intellectual property, and in the course of litigation, such competitors occasionally attempt to challenge the breadth of our ability to prevent others from using similar marks or designs. If such challenges were to be successful, less ability to prevent others from using similar marks or designs may ultimately result in a reduced distinctiveness of our brand in the minds of consumers. Defending or enforcing our trademark rights, branding practices and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources and divert the attention of management, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. Even though competitors occasionally attempt to challenge our ability to prevent infringers from using our marks, we are not aware of any challenges to our right to use, and to authorize our franchisees to use, any of our brand names or trademarks.. In addition, franchisee noncompliance with the terms and conditions of our franchise agreements and our brand standards may reduce the overall goodwill of our brand, whether through diminished consumer perception of our brand, dilution of our intellectual property, the failure to meet the FTC guidelines or applicable state laws, or through the participation in improper or objectionable business practices. Moreover, unauthorized third parties may use our intellectual property to trade on the goodwill of our brand, resulting in consumer confusion or dilution. Any reduction of our brand's goodwill, consumer confusion, or dilution is likely to impact sales, and could materially and adversely impact our business and operating results.. Our business is heavily reliant on technology infrastructure for certain key aspects of our internal operations.. The systems may not perform as desired or we may experience cost overages, delays, or other factors that may distract our management from our business, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.  Further, we may not be able to obtain future new technologies and systems, or to replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as our competitors or in a cost-effective manner. Also, we may not achieve the benefits anticipated or required. 37. Table of Contents. from any new technology or system, including those related to our recent acquisition of booj, a real estate technology company, and we may not be able to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future.. We rely on third parties for certain important functions and/or technology. Any failures by those vendors and service providers could disrupt our business operations.. We have outsourced certain key functions to external parties, including some that are critical to financial reporting, our franchise and membership tracking/billing, the Motto loan origination system, and a number of critical consumer- and franchise/agent-facing websites. We may enter into other key outsourcing relationships in the future. If one or more of these external parties were not able to perform their functions for a period of time, perform them at an acceptable service level, or handle increased volumes, our business operations could be constrained, disrupted, or otherwise negatively affected. Our use of vendors also exposes us to the risk of losing intellectual property or confidential information and to other harm. Our ability to monitor the activities or performance of vendors may be constrained, which makes it difficult for us to assess and manage the risks associated with these relationships.. We rely on traffic to our websites, including our flagship website, remax.com, directed from search engines like Google and Bing. If our websites fail to rank prominently in unpaid search results, traffic to our websites could decline and our business could be adversely affected.. Our success depends in part on our ability to attract home buyers and sellers to our websites, including our flagship websites, remax.com and mottomortgage.com through unpaid Internet search results on search engines like Google and Bing. The number of users we attract from search engines is due in large part to how and where our websites rank in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors, such as changes in ranking algorithms, many of which are not under our direct control, and they may change frequently. In addition, our website faces increasing competition for audience from real estate portal websites, such as Zillow, Trulia and Realtor.com. As a result, links to our websites may not be prominent enough to drive traffic to our websites, and we may not be in a position to influence the results. In some instances, search engine companies may change these rankings in order to promote their own competing services or the services of one or more of our competitors. Our websites have experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our websites could adversely impact our business and results of operations.. Any disruption or reduction in our information technology capabilities or websites or other threats to our cybersecurity or the physical security of our business records could harm our business.. Our information technologies and systems and those of our third-party hosted services are vulnerable to breach, damage or interruption from various causes, including: (i) natural disasters, war and acts of terrorism, (ii) power losses, computer systems failure, Internet and telecommunications or data network failures, operator error, losses and corruption of data, and similar events and (iii) computer viruses, penetration by individuals seeking to disrupt operations or misappropriate information and other physical or electronic breaches of security. Our physical filing systems are vulnerable to security breaches or damage from a variety of possible causes. We may not be able to prevent a disruption to or a material adverse effect on our business or operations in the event of a disaster, theft of data or other business interruption. Any extended interruption in our technologies or systems, significant breach or damage of electronic or physical files could significantly curtail our ability to conduct our business and generate revenue or could expose us to liability for improper handling of personally identifiable information. Additionally, our business interruption insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur.. We are vulnerable to certain additional risks and uncertainties associated with websites, which include our lead referral system LeadStreet, remax.com, global.remax.com, theremaxcollection.com, remaxcommercial.com and mottomortgage.com. These risks include changes in required technology interfaces, website downtime and other technical failures, security breaches and consumer privacy concerns. We may experience service disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including reliance on our third-party hosted services, infrastructure changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our platform simultaneously, and denial of service, fraud or attacks. Our failure to address these risks and uncertainties. 38. Table of Contents. successfully could reduce our Internet presence, generate fewer leads for our agents and damage our brand.  Many of the risks relating to our website operations are beyond our control.. We are new to the mortgage brokerage industry, which, along with the intense competition within the industry, may hinder our efforts to establish and grow our new mortgage brokerage franchising business, Motto Mortgage, which could have implications to the goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.. We are pursuing a growth strategy to offer and sell residential mortgage brokerage franchises in the U.S under the \"Motto Mortgage\" brand and trademarks. Our investments in the new Motto business included the cost of our acquisition of certain assets of Full House Mortgage Connection, Inc. (\"Full House\") and initial funding for the business. We lack extensive operating experience in the mortgage brokerage industry. Our strategy hinges on our ability to recruit franchisees and loan originators, to develop and maintain strong competencies within the mortgage brokerage market, on favorable conditions in the related regulatory environment and on our success in developing a strong, respected brand. We may fail to understand, interpret, implement and/or train franchisees adequately concerning compliance requirements related to the mortgage brokerage industry or the relationship between us and our franchisees, any of which failures could subject us or our franchisees to adverse actions from regulators. Motto Franchising, LLC, may also have regulatory obligations arising from its relationship with Motto franchisees; we may fail to comply with those obligations, and that failure could also subject us to adverse actions from regulators. As a start-up, the Motto Mortgage brand's initial lack of brand recognition may hamper franchise sales efforts. We may experience impairment of acquired assets and/or potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquisition of the business of Full House. This venture could divert resources, including the time and attention of management and other key employees, from our RE/MAX business, and a prolonged diversion could negatively impact operating results. In addition, residential mortgage brokerage is a highly competitive industry and Motto will suffer if we are unable to attract franchisees, which will adversely affect Motto's growth, operations and profitability.  Motto has $11.8 million of goodwill recognized in connection with its acquisition.  Poor performance for any of the reasons outlined above could trigger an impairment of this goodwill.. The terms of RE/MAX, LLC's senior secured credit facility restrict the current and future operations of RMCO, RE/MAX, LLC and their subsidiaries.. RE/MAX, LLC's senior secured credit facility includes a number of customary restrictive covenants. These covenants could impair the financing and operational flexibility of RMCO, RE/MAX, LLC and their subsidiaries and make it difficult for them to react to market conditions and satisfy their ongoing capital needs and unanticipated cash requirements. Specifically, such covenants may restrict their ability to, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur additional debt;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake certain investments, acquisitions and joint ventures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpay dividends or make distributions or other payments to us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tuse assets as security in certain transactions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trepurchase their equity interests;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsell certain assets or merge with or into other companies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tguarantee the debts of others;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into new lines of business; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake certain payments on subordinated debt.. In addition, so long as any revolving loans are outstanding under the senior secured credit facility, RE/MAX, LLC is required to maintain specified financial ratios. As of December 31, 2017, there were no outstanding revolving loans.. 39. Table of Contents. The ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of the senior secured credit facility will depend on the future operating performance of RE/MAX, LLC and its subsidiaries. If RE/MAX, LLC fails to comply with such covenants and terms, it would be required to obtain waivers from the lenders or agree with the lenders to an amendment of the facility's terms to maintain compliance under the facility, such as the waivers received in connection with the delayed filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. If RE/MAX, LLC is unable to obtain any necessary waivers or amendments and the debt under our senior secured credit facility is accelerated or the lenders obtain other remedies, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future operating performance.. We have significant debt service obligations and may incur additional indebtedness in the future.. We have significant debt service obligations, including principal, interest and commitment fee payments due quarterly pursuant to RE/MAX, LLC's senior secured credit facility. Our currently existing indebtedness, or any additional indebtedness we may incur, could require us to divert funds identified for other purposes for debt service and impair our liquidity position. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue additional equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know whether we would be able to take such actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us, or at all. Future indebtedness may impose additional restrictions on us, which could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, to make capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities. Our level of indebtedness has important consequences to you and your investment in our Class A common stock.. For example, our level of indebtedness may:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our debt, which would reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimit our ability to pay future dividends;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans and other investments, which may limit our ability to implement our business strategy;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\theighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the housing industry or in the general economy and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the housing industry; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise or successfully carrying out our plans to expand our franchise base and product offerings.. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make payments on our indebtedness or to fund our operations.. As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. Our ability to make payments to fund working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, and strategic acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.. Variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.. As of December 31, 2017, $229.0 million in term loans were outstanding under our senior secured credit facility, net of an unamortized discount and issuance costs, which was at variable rates of interest, thereby exposing us to interest rate risk. We currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity. As such, if interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our outstanding indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income would decrease.. 40. Table of Contents. Our operating results are subject to quarterly fluctuations, and results for any quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.. Historically, we have realized, and expect to continue to realize, lower Adjusted EBITDA margins in the first and fourth quarters due primarily to the impact of lower broker fees and other revenue primarily as a result of lower overall home sale transactions, and higher selling, operating and administrative expenses in the first quarter for expenses incurred in connection with our annual convention. Accordingly, our results of operations may fluctuate on a quarterly basis, which would cause period to period comparisons of our operating results to not be necessarily meaningful and cannot be relied upon as indicators of future annual performance.. The Special Committee investigation has caused us to incur significant expenses,  and we may continue to incur additional expenses and other adverse effects following the completion of the Special Committee investigation as we implement remedial measures in response to the findings of the Special Committee and address other consequences of the investigation.. In October 2017, our Board of Directors appointed a special committee of independent directors (the \"Special Committee\") to investigate actions of certain members of our senior management. The Special Committee completed its investigation in February 2018 and identified previously undisclosed transactions involving a loan of personal funds from the Company's then CEO and principal executive officer, David Liniger, to the Company's then COO, Adam Contos, as well as certain other personal transactions, including cash and non-cash gifts from David and Gail Liniger to Mr. Contos and others. Although the loan, gifts, and other transactions between the Linigers and Mr. Contos did not involve use of any corporate funds, the Special Committee concluded that these transactions created an actual or apparent conflict of interest. The Special Committee also concluded that Mr. Liniger and Mr. Contos violated the Company's Code of Ethics by engaging in certain transactions and by failing to report those transactions to the Company. The Special Committee also identified instances of noncompliance with other Company policies related to workplace conduct that were limited to actions of Mr. Liniger and did not extend to other members of the Company's leadership team.. As a result of the Special Committee investigation, the Company's management team is implementing, under the oversight of the Board of Directors, remedial measures to address various findings of the Special Committee as well as to address deficiencies in our internal controls. These efforts include among other matters (i) enhanced corporate policies and practices including with respect to gifts, loans, conflicts of interest and workplace conduct, (ii) enhanced procedures and practices concerning reporting including with respect to compliance matters, (iii) enhanced training on a range of matters including the responsibilities of officers and leaders related to workplace conduct and various compliance issues, (iv) a range of other actions designed to reinforce changes to the corporate culture in key areas including compliance and workplace practices, and (v) various remedial measures in connection with the deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting including an identified material weakness.  The remedial measures referred to above are in process and are not complete as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and it is expected that these remedial measures and improvements to governance and corporate policies and practices will continue in future periods over a sustained period of time. See \"Item 9A - Controls and Procedures.\". During the fourth quarter of 2017, we incurred $2.6 million in expenses related to the Special Committee investigation, and we will continue to incur significant expenses in the first quarter of 2018 and future periods related to the Special Committee investigation and the ongoing implementation of the remedial measures adopted as a result of the findings of the Special Committee.. Some of the anticipated increase in costs will result from enhanced procedures and corrective measures that we need to take with respect to public company compliance work including with respect to our internal controls and disclosures controls and procedures in order to report our financial results and file our SEC filings in a timely manner.  In addition, our Board of Directors, senior management and other employees have spent, and will continue to spend, significant time and resources in connection with the Special Committee investigation and the response to the findings of the Special Committee including the adoption and implementation of remedial measures.  The time and attention required for these matters may divert management and our Board of Directors from other actions that would be devoted toward our. 41. Table of Contents. operations and the implementation of our business strategy and thereby could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. As a consumer-facing company, maintaining, protecting and enhancing the \"RE/MAX\" brand is critical to growing our business. The findings by the Special Committee could adversely affect our reputation, our brand and our ability to obtain new business or retain existing business, attract and retain employees, access the capital markets and secure financing, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the market price of our common stock.. We may experience legal proceedings related to the matters underlying the Special Committee investigation and such legal proceedings may result in adverse findings, the imposition of fines or other penalties, increased costs and expenses and the diversion of management's time and resources.. We may experience legal proceedings including investigations, securities class action claims and/or derivative litigation related to matters reviewed by the Special Committee. The Company has advised the staff of the SEC regarding the internal investigation being undertaken by the Special Committee.  The SEC is performing its own investigative review of certain matters related to the Special Committee investigation.  The Company has been, and intends to continue, cooperating fully with the SEC with respect to its review of these matters.. Any legal proceedings related to the Special Committee investigation including any shareholder derivative litigation or governmental inquiries or investigations may divert management's time and attention and may result in the incurrence of significant expense, including legal fees. Such legal proceedings could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows including as a result of such expenses or arising from any consequences of such legal proceedings including damages, monetary fines, sanctions, penalties, adverse publicity and damage to reputation.. We have identified control deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that constitute a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to remediate these control deficiencies including this material weakness, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and thereby adversely affect the market price of our common stock.. As disclosed in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company did not have an effective risk assessment process to identify and assess the financial reporting risks related to benefits provided by principal stockholders.  As a consequence, the Company did not have effective controls and training of personnel over the identification and communication of related party transactions to financial reporting personnel, management, and the Board, as appropriate, to identify and evaluate recognition, measurement and disclosure of such transactions.. In particular, the Company's controls failed to timely identify, record and disclose certain transactions between the Company's non-Executive Chairman and Co-Founder and other Company personnel. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.. As a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2017 and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2017. These control deficiencies have been in existence for a substantial period of time, but we are actively engaged in developing and implementing remedial measures designed to address these control deficiencies including the identified material weakness, but we have not remedied these matters as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and can provide no assurance that we will be successful in remediating these deficiencies or the material weakness in a timely manner, or at all, or that we will not identify additional deficiencies and material weaknesses in the future. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address these deficiencies or the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which could cause investors to. 42. Table of Contents. lose confidence in our reported financial information and thereby adversely affect the perception of our business and the market price of our common stock. See \"Item 9A - Controls and Procedures.\". We have recently experienced changes in our senior management team, our management structure and our governance, any of which changes may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business, which may have an adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations.. We have recently experienced significant changes in our senior management team and in our management structure. On February 14, 2018, we announced that we had completed the transition of CEO responsibilities from our Co-Founder David Liniger, who had previously been serving as our Co-CEO and principal executive officer, to Adam Contos, who was previously Co-CEO with Mr. Liniger. Effective February 14, 2018, Mr. Contos became our sole CEO and our principal executive officer. Mr. Liniger continues to serve on our Board of Directors as non-executive Chairman. In addition, the Board of Directors broadened the scope of authority and responsibilities of our Lead Independent Director position, in part to assist with the Company's further response to the findings of the Special Committee and to provide enhanced Board oversight and involvement during the transition in management roles.  Richard Covey has been appointed to serve as the Lead Independent Director.. These changes in our senior management team and our governance structure and the short time period over which they occurred may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business. In addition, our future success will depend in part on Mr. Contos' successful transition to his role as the sole CEO and principal executive officer.  One of the findings of the Special Committee was that Mr. Contos had violated our Code of Ethics in connection with the failure to disclose the loan and certain other transactions involving Mr. Liniger.. David Liniger transitioned to the role of non-executive Chairman of our Board of Directors on February 14, 2018.  Findings of the Special Committee included that Mr. Liniger had violated our Code of Ethics in connection with the failure to disclose the loan and certain other transactions involving Mr. Contos.  The Special Committee also identified instances of noncompliance with other Company policies related to workplace conduct, which were limited to Mr. Liniger's actions and did not extend to other members of senior management. For more information regarding the Special Committee investigation, see \"Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Special Investigation.\". The Board of Directors appointed Richard Covey to serve as Lead Independent Director with enhanced authority and responsibilities in order to provide additional oversight and assistance to the senior management team from the Board of Directors during this period of transition in the management and governance structure of the Company.. There can be no assurance that we will manage to navigate successfully the transition in our management and governance structure that we have begun to implement during the time period of the conclusion of the Special Committee investigation.  In addition, the transition structure that we are implementing may not prove to be successful in certain respects and we may experience other developments that lead us to implement further changes in governance and management structure.. Our financial condition and results of operations may suffer if we experience adverse developments our outcomes in connection with our efforts to manage the transition in our management team and governance structure.  In the event that our management team is unable to effectively manage our business, for example, during this time period, we may experience a decline in our business and results of operation.  In addition, uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of these management and governance transitions may harm our business in other ways and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.. 43. Table of Contents. Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure. RIHI has substantial control over us including over decisions that require the approval of stockholders, and its interest in our business may conflict with yours.. RIHI is controlled by David Liniger, our current Chairman and Co-Founder, and Gail Liniger, our Vice Chair and Co-Founder, respectively, holds a majority of the combined voting power of our capital stock through its ownership of 100% of our outstanding Class B common stock. Although the Class B common stock has no economic rights, shares of Class B common stock entitle the holder, without regard to the number of shares of Class B common stock held, to a number of votes on matters presented to stockholders of RE/MAX Holdings that is equal to two times the aggregate number of common units of RMCO held by such holder, and unless certain events occur, may continue to do so until October 7, 2018.. Accordingly, RIHI, acting alone, has the ability to approve or disapprove substantially all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. These rights may enable RIHI to consummate transactions that may not be in the best interests of holders of our Class A common stock or, conversely, prevent the consummation of transactions that may be in the best interests of holders of our Class A common stock. In addition, although RIHI has voting control of us, RIHI's entire economic interest in us is in the form of its direct interest in RMCO through the ownership of RMCO common units, the payments it may receive from us under its tax receivable agreement and the proceeds it may receive upon any redemption of its RMCO common units, including issuance of shares of our Class A common stock upon any such redemption and any subsequent sale of such Class A common stock. As a result, RIHI's interests may conflict with the interests of our Class A common stockholders. For example, RIHI may have a different tax position from us which could influence its decisions regarding certain transactions, especially in light of the existence of the tax receivable agreements that we entered into in connection with our IPO, and whether and when we should terminate the tax receivable agreements and accelerate our obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration the tax or other considerations of RIHI, even in situations where no similar considerations are relevant to us.. In addition, Mr. Liniger served as our Co-CEO until February 2018. As described above, in connection with its investigation, the Special Committee concluded that Mr. Liniger violated the Company's Code of Ethics and other Company policies. Although Mr. Liniger is no longer involved in the day-to-day management of the Company, his control of RIHI and therefore his position as a controlling shareholder of the Company, as well as his position as Chairman of the Board of Directors, may allow him to exert significant influence over the decisions of management and our business, which may result in conflicts with other members of the Board of Directors.. We have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.. As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses, and our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to compliance initiatives resulting from operating as a public company. We anticipate that these costs and compliance initiatives will increase as a result of the ongoing implementation of the remedial measures adopted as a result of the findings of the Special Committee, as described above, as well as in connection with our efforts to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and in our disclosure controls and procedures.  In addition, we anticipate further costs and compliance initiatives in connection with the Company having ceased to be an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act, as of December 31, 2016. Because we no longer qualified as an \"emerging growth company,\" our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 was the first one in which we were required to include an attestation report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that is issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. In addition, we had previously taken advantage of the JOBS Act's reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \"emerging growth companies\" regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory \"say-on-pay\" votes on executive compensation. As of December 31, 2016, we were no longer eligible for such reduced disclosure requirements and exemptions.. 44. Table of Contents. We depend on distributions from RMCO to pay taxes and expenses, including payments under the tax receivable agreements, but RMCO's ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions.. We have no material assets other than our ownership of common units of RMCO and have no independent means of generating revenue. RMCO is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income is allocated to RMCO's partners, including us. As a result, we incur income taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income of RMCO and are responsible for complying with U.S. and foreign tax laws. Under the terms of RMCO's fourth amended and restated limited liability company operating agreement, which became effective upon the completion of our IPO (the \"New RMCO, LLC agreement\"), RMCO is obligated to make tax distributions to its members, including us. In addition to tax expenses, we also incur expenses related to our operations and must satisfy obligations under the terms of the tax receivable agreements, which we expect will be significant over the fifteen-year term. As RMCO's managing member, we cause RMCO to make distributions in an amount sufficient to allow us to pay our taxes and operating expenses, including any payments due under the tax receivable agreements. However, RMCO's ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions including, but not limited to, restrictions on distributions that would either violate any contract or agreement to which RMCO is then a party, including debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering RMCO insolvent. If RMCO does not have sufficient funds to pay tax or other liabilities to fund our operations, we may have to borrow funds, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and subject us to various restrictions imposed by any such lenders. To the extent we are unable to make payments under the tax receivable agreements for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. If RMCO does not have sufficient funds to make distributions, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends may also be restricted or impaired. See \"Risk Factors - Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock.\". Our tax receivable agreements require us to make cash payments based upon future tax benefits to which we may become entitled, and the amounts that we may be required to pay could be significant.. In connection with our IPO, we entered into tax receivable agreements with our historical owners. After one of these historical owners assigned its interest in its tax receivable agreement, these tax receivable agreements are now held by RIHI and Oberndorf Investments LLC (\"Oberndorf\" and together, the \"TRA Parties\"). The amount of the cash payments that we may be required to make under the tax receivable agreements could be significant and will depend, in part, upon facts and circumstances that are beyond our control.. The amount of our obligations pursuant to the tax receivable agreement with RIHI will depend, in part, upon the occurrence of future events, including any redemptions by RIHI of its ownership interest in RMCO.  In general, future redemptions by RIHI will increase our tax receivable agreement obligations to RIHI.    Payments under the tax receivable agreements are anticipated to be made, on an annual basis. Any payments made by us to the TRA Parties under the tax receivable agreements will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. To the extent we are unable to make timely payments under the tax receivable agreements for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid by us. Furthermore, our future obligation to make payments under the tax receivable agreements could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that may be deemed realized under the tax receivable agreements. The payments under the tax receivable agreement with RIHI are not conditioned upon RIHI maintaining a continued ownership interest in either RMCO or us, and payments under the tax receivable agreement with Oberndorf are not conditioned upon Oberndorf holding any ownership interest in either RMCO or us.. The amounts that we may be required to pay to the TRA Parties under the tax receivable agreements may be accelerated in certain circumstances and may also significantly exceed the actual tax benefits that we ultimately realize.. The tax receivable agreements provide that if certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control were to occur, or that if, at any time, we elect an early termination of the tax receivable agreements, then our obligations, or our successor's obligations, to make payments under the tax receivable agreements would be based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the tax receivable agreements.. 45. Table of Contents. As a result, (i) we could be required to make cash payments to the TRA Parties that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to the tax receivable agreements, and (ii) if we elect to terminate the tax receivable agreements early, we would be required to make an immediate cash payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the tax receivable agreements, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits. In these situations, our obligations under the tax receivable agreements could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the tax receivable agreements.. We will also not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made to the TRA Parties (or their predecessors) pursuant to the tax receivable agreements if any tax benefits initially claimed by us are subsequently challenged by a taxing authority and are ultimately disallowed. Instead, any excess cash payments made by us to either of the TRA Parties will be netted against any future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the tax receivable agreements. However, we might not determine that we have effectively made an excess cash payment to either of the TRA Parties for a number of years following the initial time of such payment. As a result, it is possible that we could make cash payments under the tax receivable agreements that are substantially greater than our actual cash tax savings.. If we were deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\") as a result of our ownership of RMCO, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have an adverse effect on our business.. Under Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the 1940 Act, a company generally will be deemed to be an \"investment company\" for purposes of the 1940 Act if (i) it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities or (ii) it engages, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We do not believe that we are an \"investment company,\" as such term is defined in either of those sections of the 1940 Act.. As the sole managing member of RMCO, we control and operate RMCO. On that basis, we believe that our interest in RMCO is not an \"investment security\" as that term is used in the 1940 Act. However, if we were to cease participation in the management of RMCO, our interest in RMCO could be deemed an \"investment security\" for purposes of the 1940 Act.. We and RMCO intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. However, if we were to be deemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock. RIHI directly (through ownership of our Class B common stock) and indirectly (through ownership of RMCO common units) owns interests in us, and RIHI has the right to redeem and cause us to redeem, as applicable, such interests pursuant to the terms of the New RMCO, LLC agreement. We may elect to issue shares of Class A common stock upon such redemption, and the issuance and sale of such shares may have a negative impact on the market price of our Class A common stock.. As of December 31, 2017, we had 149,743,409 shares of Class A common stock authorized but unissued, and an additional 12,559,600 shares of Class A common stock unauthorized and unissued but reserved for issuance upon redemption of RMCO common units that are held by RIHI. In connection with our IPO, RMCO entered into the New RMCO, LLC agreement, and subject to certain restrictions set forth therein, RIHI is entitled to potentially redeem the RMCO common units it holds for an aggregate of up to 12,559,600 shares of our Class A common stock, subject to. 46. Table of Contents. customary adjustments. We also have entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which the shares of Class A common stock issued upon such redemption are eligible for resale, subject to certain limitations set forth therein.. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Class A common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our Class A common stock may have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, including shares issued in connection with an acquisition, or the perception that such sales or distributions could occur, may cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.. The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with RIHI and David Liniger, our Chairman and Co-Founder, as well as his spouse Gail Liniger, our Vice Chair and Co-Founder.. The Class B common stock has no economic rights but entitles the holder, without regard to the number of shares of Class B common stock held, to a number of votes on matters presented to stockholders of RE/MAX Holdings that is equal to two times the aggregate number of common units of RMCO held by such holder. Our Class A common stock has one vote per share.. Based on the voting rights associated with our Class B common stock, and the number of common units of RMCO that RIHI currently owns, RIHI holds nearly 60% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, RIHI controls a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore is able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.. RIHI is a Delaware corporation that is majority owned and controlled by David Liniger, our Chairman and Co-Founder, and Gail Liniger, our Vice Chair and Co-Founder. Mr. Liniger served as our Co-CEO until February 2018. As described above, in connection with its investigation, the Special Committee concluded that Mr. Liniger violated the Company's Code of Ethics and other Company policies. Although Mr. Liniger is no longer involved in the day-to-day management of the Company, his control of RIHI and therefore his position as a controlling shareholder of the Company gives him significant influence over the decisions of management. Any differences in the interests of Mr. Liniger and the interests of owners of our Class A common stock may have a negative impact on the market price of our Class A common stock and may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.. You may be diluted by future issuances of additional Class A common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise; future sales of such shares in the public market, or the expectations that such sales may occur, could lower our stock price.. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue shares of Class A common stock and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to Class A common stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion. This could include issuances as compensation pursuant to our 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan, in connection with acquisitions (either by issuing shares to raise funds for such an acquisition, or by issuing shares to the seller of the acquired business) or to raise capital for other purposes.  Any Class A common stock that we issue, including under our 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership held by the investors who own Class A common stock.. Our Class A common stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.. Many factors, which are outside our control, may cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate significantly, including those described elsewhere in this \"Risk Factors\" section, as well as the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour operating and financial performance and prospects;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry compared to market expectations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconditions that impact demand for our services, including the condition of the U.S. residential housing market. 47.

Volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent investors from being able to sell their common stock at or above the price they paid for the stock. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low. As a result, you may suffer a loss on your investment.. We cannot assure you that we will have the available cash to make dividend payments.. We intend to continue to pay cash dividends quarterly. Whether we will do so, however, and the timing and amount of those dividends, will be subject to approval and declaration by our Board of Directors and will depend upon on a variety of factors, including our financial results, cash requirements and financial condition, our ability to pay dividends under our senior secured credit facility and any other applicable contracts, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Any dividends declared and paid will not be cumulative.. Because we are a holding company with no material assets other than our ownership of common units of RMCO, we have no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay dividends is dependent upon the financial results and cash flows of RMCO and its subsidiaries and distributions we receive from RMCO. We expect to cause RMCO to make distributions to fund our expected dividend payments, subject to applicable law and any restrictions contained in RMCO's or its subsidiaries' current or future debt agreements.. Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablish a classified Board of Directors so that not all members of our Board of Directors are elected at one time;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tauthorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval,. 48. Table of Contents. dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovide that our Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelegate the sole power to a majority of our Board of Directors to fix the number of directors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovide the power of our Board of Directors to fill any vacancy on our Board of Directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teliminate the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.. Our certificate of incorporation also contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and prevents us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15% of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition, except that David and Gail Liniger are deemed to have been approved by our Board of Directors, and thereby not subject to these restrictions. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our Company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire."
