[1] "ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS. You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The market or trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks. In addition, please see our note about forward-looking statements included in Part II, Item 7, MD&A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business,  operations and stock price.. Risks Related to our Business. Volatility in gold, silver, copper, nickel and other metal prices may have an adverse impact on the value of our stream and royalty interests and may reduce our revenues. Certain contracts governing our stream and royalty interests have features that may amplify the negative effects of a drop in metals prices.. The profitability of our stream and royalty interests is directly related to the market price of gold, silver, copper, nickel and other metals. Our revenue is particularly sensitive to changes in the price of gold, as we derive a majority of our revenue from gold stream and royalty interests. Market prices may fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond the control of Royal Gold or any mining company, including metal supply, industrial and jewelry fabrication, investment demand, central banking economic policy, expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, the relative strength of the dollar and other currencies, interest rates, gold purchases, sales and loans by central banks, forward sales by metal producers, global or regional political, economic or banking conditions, and a number of other factors.. 6. Table of Contents. Volatility in gold, silver, copper and nickel prices is demonstrated by the annual high and low prices for those metals over the past decade as reported by, in the case of gold and silver, the London Bullion Market Association, and in the case of copper and nickel, the London Metal Exchange:.

Declines in market prices could cause an operator to reduce, suspend or terminate production from an operating project or construction work at a development project, which may result in a temporary or permanent reduction or cessation of revenue from those projects, and may prevent us from being able to recover the initial investment in our stream and royalty interests. Our streaming agreements provide us the right to purchase metals either at a fixed price per ounce or a specified percentage of the spot price. Our margin between the price at which we can purchase metals pursuant to streaming agreements and the price at which we sell metals in the market will vary as metal prices vary; in the event of metal price declines, we would generate lower cash flow or earnings, or possibly losses. Further, our sliding - scale royalties, such as Cortez, Holt, Mulatos and other properties, amplify the effect of declines in market prices for metals because when prices fall below price thresholds specified in a sliding - scale royalty, a lower royalty rate will apply. A price decline may result in a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Metal price fluctuations between the time that decisions about development and construction of a mine are made and the commencement of production can have a material adverse effect on the economics of a mine and can eliminate or have a material adverse impact on the value of stream and royalty interests on the property.. Where gold and silver are produced as co-products or by - products at the properties where we hold stream and royalty interests, an operator's production decisions and the economic cut - off applied to its reporting of gold and silver reserves and resources may be influenced by changes in the commodity prices of the principal metals produced at the mines.. Moreover, certain agreements governing our royalty interests, such as those relating to our royalty interests in the Robinson and Peñasquito properties, are based on the operator's concentrate sales to smelters, which include price adjustments between the operator and the smelter based on metals prices at a later date, typically three to five months after shipment to the smelter. In such cases, our payments from the operator include a component of these later price adjustments, which can result in decreased revenue in later periods if metals prices have fallen.. We own passive interests in mining properties, and it is difficult or impossible for us to ensure properties are developed or operated in our best interest.. All of our current revenue is derived from stream and royalty interests on properties operated by third parties. The holder of a stream or royalty interest typically has no authority regarding the development or operation of a mineral property. Therefore, we typically are not in control of decisions regarding development or operation of any of the properties on which we hold a stream or royalty interest, and we have limited legal rights to influence those decisions.. Our strategy of acquiring and holding stream and royalty interests on properties operated by third parties puts us generally at risk to the decisions of others regarding all operating matters, including permitting, feasibility analysis, mine design and operation, processing, plant and equipment matters and temporary or permanent suspension of operations, among others. As a result, our revenue is dependent upon the activities of third parties, which creates the risk that at any time those third parties may: (i) have business interests that are inconsistent with ours, (ii) take action contrary to our interests, policies or objectives, or (iii) be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under their agreements with us. At any time, any of the operators of our mining properties may decide to suspend or discontinue operations. Except in limited circumstances,. 7. Table of Contents. we will not be entitled to material compensation if operations are shut down, suspended or discontinued on a temporary or permanent basis. Although we attempt to secure contractual rights when we create new stream or royalty interests, such as audit or access rights, that will permit us to protect our interests to a degree, there can be no assurance that such rights will always be available or sufficient, or that our efforts will be successful in achieving timely or favorable results or in affecting the operation of the properties in which we have a stream or royalty interest in ways that would be beneficial to our stockholders.. Our revenues are subject to operational and other risks faced by operators of our mining properties.. Although we generally are not required to pay capital costs on projects on which we hold stream or royalty interests (except for transactions where we finance mine development or actively fund or participate in exploration), our financial results are indirectly subject to hazards and risks normally associated with developing and operating mining properties where we hold stream and royalty interests. Some of these risks include:. •insufficient ore reserves;. •increases in capital or operating costs incurred by operators or third parties that may impact the amount of reserves available to be mined, cause an operator to delay or curtail mining development and operations, or render mining of ore uneconomical and cause an operator to suspend or close operations;. •declines in the price of gold, silver, copper, nickel and other metals;. •mine operating and ore processing facility problems;. •significant permitting, environmental and other regulatory requirements and restrictions and any changes in those regulations or their enforcement;. •challenges by non - mining interests, including by local communities, indigenous populations and non - governmental organizations, to existing permits and mining rights, and to applications for permits and mining rights;. •community or civil unrest;. •labor shortage of miners, geologists and mining experts, changes in labor laws, increased labor costs, and labor disputes, strikes or work stoppages at mines;. •unavailability of mining, drilling and related equipment;. •unanticipated geological conditions or metallurgical characteristics;. •unanticipated ground or water conditions, including lack of access to sufficient quantities of water for operations;. •pit wall or tailings dam failures or any underground stability issues;. •fires, explosions and other industrial accidents;. •environmental hazards and natural catastrophes such as droughts, floods, hurricanes or earthquakes;. •injury to persons, property or the environment;. •the ability of operators to maintain or increase production or to replace reserves as properties are mined;. •potential increased operating costs arising from climate change initiatives and their impact on energy and other costs in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions;. •uncertain domestic and foreign political and economic environments;. •economic downturns and operators' insufficient financing;. •default by an operator on its obligations to us or its other creditors;. •insolvency, bankruptcy or other financial difficulty of the operator; and. 8. Table of Contents. •changes in laws or regulations, including changes implemented by new political administrations.. The occurrence of any of the above mentioned risks or hazards, among others, could result in an interruption, suspension or termination of operations or development work at any of the properties in which we hold a stream or royalty interest and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.. Many of our stream and royalty interests are important to us and any adverse development related to these properties could adversely affect our revenues and financial condition.. Our investments in the Mount Milligan, Andacollo, Pueblo Viejo,  Wassa and Prestea and Peñasquito properties generated approximately $341.7 million in revenue in fiscal year 2018, or 74% of our revenue for the period. We expect these properties and others to be important to us in fiscal year 2019 and beyond. Any adverse development affecting the operation of or production from any of these properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Any adverse decision made by the operators, such as changes to mine plans, production schedules, metallurgical processes or royalty calculation methodologies, may materially and adversely impact the timing and amount of revenue that we receive.. Problems concerning the existence, validity, enforceability, terms or geographic extent of our stream and royalty interests could adversely affect our business and revenues, and our interests may similarly be materially and adversely impacted by change of control, bankruptcy or the insolvency of operators.. Defects in or disputes relating to the stream and royalty interests we hold or acquire may prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits from these interests, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Material changes could also occur that may adversely affect management's estimate of the carrying value of our stream and royalty interests and could result in impairment charges. While we seek to confirm the existence, validity, enforceability, terms and geographic extent of the stream and royalty interests we acquire, there can be no assurance that disputes or other problems concerning these and other matters or other problems will not arise. Confirming these matters is complex and is subject to the application of the laws of each jurisdiction to the particular circumstances of each parcel of mining property and to the documents reflecting the stream or royalty interest. Similarly, stream interests and, in many jurisdictions, royalty interests are contractual in nature, rather than interests in land, and therefore may be subject to change of control, bankruptcy or insolvency of operators, and our stream or royalty interests could be materially restricted or set aside through judicial or administrative proceedings. We often do not have the protection of security interests that could help us recover all or part of our investment in a stream or royalty interest.. We have limited access to data and disclosure regarding the operation of the properties on which we have stream and royalty interests, which may limit our ability to assess the performance of a stream or royalty interest.. Although certain agreements governing our stream and royalty interests require the operators to provide us with production, operating and other information, we do not have the contractual right to receive such information for all of our interests. As a result, we may have limited access to data about the operations and the properties themselves, which could affect our ability to assess the performance of a stream or royalty interest. This could result in delays in, or reductions of, our cash flow from the amounts that we anticipate based on the stage of development of or production from the properties which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.. Acquired stream and royalty interests, particularly on development stage properties, are subject to the risk that they may not produce anticipated revenues.. The stream and royalty interests we acquire may not produce anticipated revenues. The success of our acquisitions of stream and royalty interests is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation, timing and amount of revenues to be derived from our stream and royalty interests, the geological, metallurgical and other technical aspects of the project, and, for development projects, the costs, timing and conduct of development. If an operator does not bring a property into production and operate in accordance with feasibility studies, technical or reserve reports or mine and other plans due to lack of capital, inexperience, unexpected problems, delays, or otherwise, then the acquired stream or royalty interest may not yield sufficient revenues to be profitable for us. Furthermore, operators of properties at all. 9. Table of Contents. stages must obtain and maintain all necessary environmental permits and access to adequate supplies of water, power and other raw materials, as well as financing, necessary to begin or sustain development or production, and there can be no assurance that operators will be able to do so.. The failure of any of our principal properties to produce anticipated revenues on schedule or at all would have a material adverse effect on our asset carrying values or the other benefits we expect to realize from the acquisition of stream and royalty interests, and potentially our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.. For example, we experienced an impairment charge of $239.1 million for the Pascua-Lama mining project during our third quarter of fiscal 2018 after Barrick Gold Corporation (\"Barrick\"), the owner of the project, reclassified the proven and probable reserves for the Chilean portion of the project, to which our royalty interest relates, and, ultimately, suspended further development of the project, in response to sanctions by the Chilean government.  See Note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.  Further, as mines on which we have stream and royalty interests mature, we can expect overall declines in production unless operators are able to replace reserves that are mined through mine expansion or successful new exploration. There can be no assurance that the operators of properties where we hold stream and royalty interests will be able to maintain or increase production or replace reserves as they are mined.. Operators may interpret our stream and royalty interests in a manner adverse to us or otherwise may not abide by their contractual obligations, and we could be forced to take legal action to enforce our contractual rights.. Our stream and royalty interests generally are subject to uncertainties and complexities arising from the application of contract and property laws in the jurisdictions where the mining projects are located. Operators and other parties to the agreements governing our stream and royalty interests may interpret our interests in a manner adverse to us or otherwise may not abide by their contractual obligations, and we could be forced to take legal action to enforce our contractual rights. We may or may not be successful in enforcing our contractual rights, and our revenues relating to any challenged stream or royalty interests may be delayed, curtailed or eliminated during the pendency of any such dispute or in the event our position is not upheld, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Disputes could arise challenging, among other things, methods for calculating the stream or royalty interest, various rights of the operator or third parties in or to the stream or royalty interest or the underlying property, the obligations of a current or former operator to make payments on stream and royalty interests, and various defects or ambiguities in the agreement governing a stream or royalty interest.. For example, on October 6, 2017, the Labrador Nickel Royalty Limited Partnership (\"LNRLP\"), of which the Company is the indirect majority owner, filed amendments to its original October 2009 statement of claim against Vale and certain subsidiaries of Vale. LNRLP alleges that Vale has been calculating LNRLP's 3% NSR royalty on nickel, copper and cobalt produced from the Voisey's Bay mine incorrectly since production began in late 2005, and since Vale began processing Voisey's Bay concentrates at its new Long Harbour Processing facility, and that Vale has breached its contractual duties of good faith.  Royal Gold strongly disagrees with Vale's position that full operating costs, depreciation and cost of capital are permissible net smelter return deductions pursuant to the royalty agreement and is aggressively pursuing its legal remedies.. Potential litigation affecting the properties that we have stream and royalty interests in could have a material adverse effect on us.. Potential litigation may arise between the operators of properties on which we have stream and royalty interests and third parties. For example, Barrick's Pascua - Lama mining project has been the subject of litigation by local farmers and indigenous communities alleging that the project's water management system is not in compliance with environmental permits and that the project has damaged glaciers located in the Pascua - Lama project area. As a holder of stream and royalty interests, we generally will not have any influence on litigation such as this and generally will not have access to non - public information concerning such litigation. Any such litigation that results in the reduction, suspension or termination of a project or production from a property, whether temporary or permanent, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.. 10. Table of Contents. We may enter into acquisitions or other material transactions at any time.. In the ordinary course of business, we engage in a continual review of opportunities to acquire existing stream and royalty interests, to establish new streams and royalties on operating mines, to create new stream and royalty interests through financing mine development or exploration, or to acquire companies that hold stream and royalty interests. We currently, and generally at any time, have acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review, including, for example, our engagement of consultants and advisors to analyze particular opportunities, analysis of technical, financial, legal and other confidential information, submission of indications of interest and term sheets, participation in preliminary discussions and negotiations and involvement as a bidder in competitive processes. We also consider obtaining debt commitments for acquisition financing. In the event that we choose to raise debt capital to finance any acquisition, our leverage may be increased. We also could issue common stock to fund our acquisitions. Issuances of common stock could dilute existing stockholders and may reduce some or all of our per share financial measures.. Any such acquisition could be material to us. All transactions include risks associated with our ability to negotiate acceptable terms with counter-parties.  In addition, any such acquisition or other transaction may have other transaction specific risks associated with it, including risks related to the completion of the transaction, the project, its operators, or the jurisdictions in which the project is located and other risks discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There can be no assurance that any acquisitions completed will ultimately benefit the Company.. In addition, we may consider opportunities to restructure our existing stream or royalty interests where we believe such restructuring would provide a long - term benefit to the Company, though such restructuring may reduce near - term revenues or result in the incurrence of transaction - related costs. We could enter into one or more acquisition or restructuring transactions at any time.. We may be unable to successfully acquire additional stream or royalty interests at appropriate valuations.. Our future success largely depends upon our ability to acquire stream and royalty interests at appropriate valuations, including through royalty, stream and corporate acquisitions and other financing transactions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and complete the acquisition of such stream and royalty interests or businesses that own desirable interests, at reasonable prices or on favorable terms, or, if necessary, that we will have or be able to obtain sufficient financing on reasonable terms to complete such acquisitions. Economic volatility, credit crises, or severe declines in market prices for gold, silver, copper, nickel and certain other metals, could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt or equity financing for acquisitions. In addition, changes to tax rules, accounting policies, or the treatment of stream interests by ratings agencies could make royalties, streams or other investments by the Company less attractive to counterparties. Such changes could adversely affect our ability to acquire new stream or royalty interests.. We also have competitors that are engaged in the acquisition of stream and royalty interests and companies holding such interests, including competitors with greater financial resources, and we may not be able to compete successfully against these companies in new acquisitions. If we are unable to successfully acquire additional stream or royalty interests, the reserves subject to our stream and royalty interests may decline as the producing properties on which we have such stream and royalty interests are mined or payment or production caps on certain of our royalty interests are met. We also may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or operators of properties on which we seek stream and royalty interests if we are unable to successfully complete acquisitions of such interests or complete them at satisfactory rates of return. Each of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.. We depend on our operators for the calculation of payments of our stream and royalty interests. We may not be able to detect errors and later payment calculations may call for retroactive adjustments.. The deliveries and payments under our stream and royalty interests are calculated by the operators of the properties on which we have stream and royalty interests based on their reported production. Each operator's calculation of deliveries and payments is subject to and dependent upon the adequacy and accuracy of its production and accounting functions, and, given the complex nature of mining and ownership of mining interests, errors may occur from time to time in the allocation of production and the various other calculations made by an operator. Any of these errors may render such. 11. Table of Contents. calculations inaccurate. Certain agreements governing our stream and royalty interests require the operators to provide us with production and operating information that may, depending on the completeness and accuracy of such information, enable us to detect errors in deliveries under metal streams and in the calculation of payments of royalties. We do not, however, have the contractual right to receive production information for all of our royalty interests.  As a result, our ability to detect payment errors through our stream and royalty monitoring program and its associated internal controls and procedures is limited, and the possibility exists that we will need to make retroactive revenue adjustments. Some contracts governing our stream and royalty interests provide us the right to audit the operational calculations and production data for the associated stream deliveries and royalty payments; however, such audits may occur many months following our recognition of the revenue and we may be required to adjust our revenue in later periods, which could require us to restate our financial statements.. Development and operation of mines is very capital intensive and any inability of the operators of properties where we hold stream and royalty interests to meet liquidity needs, obtain financing or operate profitably could have material adverse effects on the value of and revenue from our stream and royalty interests.. If operators of properties where we hold stream and royalty interests do not have the financial strength or sufficient credit or other financing capability to cover the costs of developing or operating a mine, the operator may curtail, delay or cease development or operations at a mine site, or enter into bankruptcy proceedings.  An operator's ability to raise and service sufficient capital may be affected by, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, future commodity prices of metals to be mined, or further economic volatility in the U.S. and global financial markets.  If certain of the operators of the properties on which we have stream and royalty interests suffer these material adverse effects, then our stream and royalty interests, including the value of and revenue from them, and the ability of operators to obtain debt or equity financing for the exploration, development and operation of their properties may be materially adversely affected.. Certain of the agreements governing our stream and royalty interests contain terms that reduce or cap the revenues generated from the interests.. Revenue from some of our stream and royalty interests will stop or decrease after threshold production, delivery or payment milestones are achieved.  For example, our gold stream at Pueblo Viejo decreases from 7.5% of Barrick's interest in gold produced at Pueblo Viejo to 3.75% after 990,000 ounces of gold have been delivered. Similarly, our silver stream at Pueblo Viejo decreases from 75% of Barrick's interest in silver produced at Pueblo Viejo to 37.50% after 50.00 million ounces of silver have been delivered. Our stream interests at Wassa and Prestea, Andacollo, and Rainy River and certain of our royalty interests at other properties are subject to similar limitations, and therefore current production and revenue results from our interests may not be indicative of future results.. Estimates of reserves and other mineralized material by the operators of mines in which we have stream and royalty interests are subject to significant revision.. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating proven and probable reserves and mineralized material, including many factors beyond our control and the control of the operators of properties in which we have stream and royalty interests. Reserve estimates for our stream and royalty interests are prepared by the operators of the mining properties. We do not participate in the preparation or verification of such reports and have not independently assessed or verified the accuracy of such information.. The estimation of reserves and of other mineralized material is a subjective process, and the accuracy of any such estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Results of drilling, metallurgical testing and production, and the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of any estimate, may cause a revision of such estimate. The volume and grade of reserves recovered and rates of production may be less than anticipated. Assumptions about gold and other precious metal prices are subject to great uncertainty, and such prices have fluctuated widely in the past. Declines in the market price of gold, silver, copper, nickel or other metals also may render reserves or mineralized material containing relatively lower ore grades uneconomical to exploit. Changes in operating costs and other factors including short - term operating factors, the processing of new or different ore grades, geotechnical characteristics and metallurgical recovery, may materially and adversely affect reserves.. 12. Table of Contents. Mineral resources as reported by some operators do not constitute mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. Due to the uncertainty of mineral resources, there can be no assurance that such resources will be upgraded to proven and probable mineral reserves as a result of continued exploration. It should not be assumed that any part or all of mineral resources on properties where we hold stream and royalty interests constitute or will be converted into mineral reserves.. Estimates of production by the operators of mines in which we have stream and royalty interests are subject to change, and actual production may vary materially from such estimates.. Production estimates are prepared by the operators of mining properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating anticipated production attributable to our stream and royalty interests, including many factors beyond our control and the control of the operators of the properties in which we have stream and royalty interests. We do not participate in the preparation or verification of production estimates and have not independently assessed or verified the accuracy of such information. The estimation of anticipated production is a subjective process and the accuracy of any such estimates is a function of the quality of available data, reliability of production history, variability in grade encountered, mechanical or other problems encountered, engineering and geological interpretation and operator judgment. Actual rates of production may be less than expected. Results of drilling, metallurgical testing and production, changes in commodity prices, and the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of any estimate may cause actual production to vary materially from such estimates.. If title to mining claims, concessions, licenses or leases from governments on mine properties is not properly maintained by the operators, or is successfully challenged by third parties, our stream and royalty interests could be found to be invalid.. Our business includes the risk that operators of mining projects and holders of exploration or mining claims, tenements, concessions, licenses or other interests in land and minerals may lose their exploration or mining rights, or have their rights to explore and mine properties contested by private parties or the government. Internationally, exploration and mining tenures are subject to loss for many reasons, including expiration, failure of the holder to meet specific legal qualifications, failure to pay maintenance fees or meet expenditure or work requirements, reduction in geographic extent upon passage of time or upon conversion from an exploration tenure to a mining tenure, failure of title, expropriation and similar risks. If title to exploration or mining tenures subject to our stream and royalty interests have not been properly established or not properly maintained, or are successfully contested, our stream and royalty interests could be adversely affected.. Operations in foreign countries or other sovereign jurisdictions are subject to many risks, which could decrease our revenues.. We derived approximately 91% of our revenues from non-U.S. sources during fiscal year 2018, compared to approximately 92% in fiscal year 2017 and approximately 90% in fiscal year 2016.   Our principal producing stream and royalty interests on properties outside of the United States are located in Canada, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Ghana and Mexico.  We currently have stream and royalty interests in mines and projects in other countries, including Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Guatemala, Honduras, Macedonia, Nicaragua, Peru, Russia, Spain and Tunisia. Various indigenous peoples may be recognized as sovereign entities and may enforce their own laws and regulations within the United States, Canada and other countries. In addition, future acquisitions may expose us to new jurisdictions.  Our activities and those of the operators of properties on which we hold stream and royalty interests are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries or within the jurisdiction of indigenous people that may be recognized as sovereign entities in the United States and elsewhere. These risks may impact or our operators, depending on the jurisdiction,  and include such things as:. •expropriation or nationalization of mining property;. •seizure of mineral production;. •exchange and currency controls and fluctuations;. •limitations on foreign exchange and repatriation of earnings;. 13. Table of Contents. •restrictions on mineral production and price controls;. •import and export regulations, including restrictions on the export of gold, silver, copper, nickel or other metals;. •changes in legislation and government policies, including changes related to taxation, government royalties, imports, exports, duties, currency, foreign ownership, foreign trade, foreign investment and other forms of government take, including any such changes as may be made in response to U.S. laws or foreign policies;. •challenges to mining, processing and related permits and licenses, or to applications for permits and licenses, by or on behalf of regulatory authorities, indigenous populations, non - governmental organizations or other third parties;. •changes in economic, trade, diplomatic and other relationships between countries, and the effect on global and economic conditions, the stability of global financial markets, and the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets;. •high rates of inflation;. •labor practices and disputes;. •enforcement of unfamiliar or uncertain foreign real estate, mineral tenure, contract, water use, mine safety and environmental laws and policies;. •renegotiation, nullification or forced modification of existing contracts, licenses, permits, approvals, concessions or the like;. •war, crime, terrorism, sabotage, civil unrest and uncertain political and economic environments;. •corruption;. •exposure to liabilities under anti - corruption and anti - money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions to which we, but not necessarily our competitors, may be subject;. •suspension of the enforcement of creditors' rights and stockholders' rights; and. •loss of access to government controlled infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, rails, ports, power sources and water supply.. In addition, many of our operators are organized outside of the United States. Our stream and royalty interests may be subject to the application of foreign laws to our operators, and their stockholders, including laws relating to foreign ownership structures, corporate transactions, creditors' rights, bankruptcy and liquidation. Foreign operations also could be adversely impacted by laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, investment and taxation.. These risks may limit or disrupt operating mines or projects on which we hold stream and royalty interests, restrict the movement of funds, or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property by nationalization or expropriation without fair compensation, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.. Opposition from indigenous people may delay or suspend development or operations at the properties where we hold stream and royalty interests, which could decrease our revenues.. Various international and national, state and provincial laws, rules, regulations and other practices relate to the rights of indigenous peoples. Some of the properties where we hold stream and royalty interests are located in areas presently or previously inhabited or used by indigenous peoples. Many of these laws impose obligations on governments to respect the rights of indigenous people. Some mandate that governments consult with indigenous people regarding government actions which may affect indigenous people, including actions to approve or grant mining rights or permits. One or more groups of indigenous people may oppose continued operation, further development, or new development of the properties where we hold stream and royalty interests. Such opposition may be directed through legal or administrative proceedings or protests, roadblocks or other forms of public expression, and claims and protests of indigenous peoples may disrupt or. 14. Table of Contents. delay activities of the operators of the properties. For example, the Pascua - Lama project has been challenged by Chilean indigenous groups and other third parties. During the fourth calendar quarter of 2013, Barrick suspended construction activities at the Pascua - Lama project, except for those activities required for environmental and regulatory compliance.  Subsequently, in the first calendar quarter of 2018, Barrick reclassified the proven and probable reserves for the Chilean portion of the project, to which our royalty interest relates, and, ultimately, suspended further development of the project, in response to sanctions by the Chilean government.. Changes in mining taxes and royalties payable to governments could decrease our revenues.. Changes in mining and tax laws in any of the United States, Canada, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Ghana, Mexico or any other country in which we have stream and royalty interests in mines or projects could affect mine development and expansion, significantly increase regulatory obligations and compliance costs with respect to mine development and mine operations, increase the cost of holding mining tenures or impose additional taxes on mining operations, all of which could adversely affect our revenue from such properties. A number of properties where we hold royalty interests are located on U.S. public lands that are subject to federal mining and other public land laws. In recent years, the United States Congress has considered a number of proposed major revisions to the General Mining Law of 1872, and other laws, which govern the creation, maintenance and possession of mining claims and related activities on public lands in the United States. Congress also has recently considered bills, which if enacted, would impose a royalty payable to the government on hardrock production, increase land holding fees, impose federal reclamation fees and financial assurances, impose additional environmental operating standards and afford greater public involvement and regulatory discretion in the mine permitting process. Such legislation, if enacted, or similar legislation in other countries, could adversely affect the development of new mines and the expansion of existing mines, as well as increase the cost of all mining operations, and could materially and adversely affect mine operators and our revenue.. The mining industry is subject to environmental risks in the U.S. and in the foreign jurisdictions where our interests are located, including risk associated with climate change.. Mining is subject to potential risks and liabilities associated with pollution of the environment and the disposal of waste products occurring as a result of mineral exploration and production. Laws and regulations in the United States and abroad intended to ensure the protection of the environment are constantly changing and evolving in a manner expected to result in stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines and liability, and potentially increased capital expenditures and operating costs. Furthermore, mining may be subject to significant environmental and other permitting requirements regarding the use of raw materials needed for operations, particularly water and power. In addition, concerns with regard to climate change in the United States and abroad have resulted in international, national and local treaties, legislation and initiatives that affect mineral exploration and production, including those intended to reduce industrial emissions and increase energy efficiency. Compliance with all such laws and regulations, treaties and initiatives (\"Laws\") could increase permitting requirements, result in stricter standards and enforcement, and require significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs by operators of properties subject to our interests. Further, breach of a Law may result in the imposition of fines and penalties or other adverse impacts on operators and their properties, which may be material. If an operator is forced to incur significant costs to comply with Laws or becomes subject to related restrictions that limit its ability to continue or expand operations, or if an operator were to lose its right to use or access power, water or other raw materials necessary to operate a mine, or if the costs to comply with Laws materially increased the capital or operating costs on the properties where we hold streams and royalties, our revenues could be reduced, delayed or eliminated. These risks are also salient with regard to our development stage properties where permitting may not be complete and/or where new legislation and regulation could lead to delays, interruptions and significant unexpected cost burdens for mine operators. For example, Argentina passed a federal glacier protection law in 2010 that could restrict mining activities in areas on or near the nation's glaciers. We have royalties on the Chilean side of the Pascua - Lama project, which straddles the border between Chile and Argentina and the glacier law could impact some aspects of the design, development and operation of the project. Further, to the extent that we become subject to environmental liabilities for any historic period during which we owned or operated properties, or relative to our current ownership interests in the lease and underlying unpatented mining claims acquired at Cortez or the lease, unpatented mining claims and exploration activities associated with the Peak Gold JV, the satisfaction of any liabilities would reduce funds otherwise available to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.. 15. Table of Contents. We are dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to cyber threats, disruption, damage and failure.. Information systems and other technologies, including those related to our financial and operational management, are an integral part of our business activities. Network and information systems - related events, such as computer hackings, cyber - attacks, ransomware, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, or power outages, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other similar events, could result in damage to our property, equipment and data, affect our ability to maintain ongoing operations, and result in significant expenditures to repair or replace the damaged property or information systems, reacquire access to networks and information systems, or to protect them from similar events in the future. In addition, any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems (or those of our third party service providers), including information about our company or our employees, third party information in our possession, and other data, could damage our reputation, expose us to legal liability and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach.   Despite security measures we have implemented and other measures we may implement in the future, and despite the fact that, to date, the Company has not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that these events and security breaches will not occur in the future or not have an adverse effect on our business.  Furthermore, new and evolving requirements relating to cybersecurity are applicable or may in the future apply to our business, including requirements relating to protection of personally identifiable information.  Compliance with such requirements could result in additional or increased compliance costs and exposure to legal liability.. We depend on the services of our President and Chief Executive Officer and other key employees.. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our key executive management personnel. Tony Jensen has served as our President and Chief Executive Officer since July 2006. Mr. Jensen's extensive commercial experience, mine operations background and industry contacts give us an important competitive advantage. The loss of the services of Mr. Jensen, other key members of management or other key employees could jeopardize our ability to maintain our competitive position in the industry. From time to time, we may also need to identify and retain additional skilled management and specialized technical personnel to efficiently operate our business. The number of persons skilled in the acquisition, exploration and development of stream and royalty interests is limited and there is competition for such persons. Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel is critical to our success and there can be no assurance of such success. If we are not successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, our ability to execute our business model and growth strategy could be affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We currently do not have key person life insurance for any of our officers or directors.. Our disclosure controls and internal control over our financial reporting are subject to inherent limitations.. Management has concluded that as of June 30, 2018, our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were effective. Such controls and procedures, however, may not be adequate to prevent or identify existing or future internal control weaknesses due to inherent limitations therein, which may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to, our dependence on operators for the calculation of royalty payments and deliveries of metal streams that translate to our revenues as discussed above in \"We depend on our operators for the calculation of payments of our stream and royalty interests. We may not be able to detect errors and later payment calculations may call for retroactive adjustments\". Given our dependence on third party calculations, there is a risk that material misstatements in results of operations and financial condition may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by our internal controls over financial reporting and may require us to restate our financial statements.. 16. Table of Contents. We have incurred indebtedness in connection with our business and may in the future incur additional indebtedness that could limit cash flow available for our operations, limit our ability to borrow additional funds and, if we were unable to repay our debt when due, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.. As of June 30, 2018, we had $370 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.875% convertible senior notes due 2019 (the \"2019 Notes\") outstanding, which we incurred in June 2012. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in connection with financing acquisitions, strategic transactions or for other purposes.  As of June 30, 2018, there was $1.0 billion available and no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt obligations, including the risk that our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required principal and interest payments and the risk that we will be unable to refinance our indebtedness when it becomes due, or that the terms of such refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our indebtedness. We may seek additional debt or equity financing in the future.. Indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For example, it could:. •require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund acquisitions of stream and royalty interests, working capital, pay dividends and other general corporate purposes;. •limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;. •restrict us from exploiting business opportunities;. •place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness;. •dilute our existing stockholders if we elect to issue common stock instead of paying cash in the event the holders convert the 2019 Notes, or any other convertible securities issued in the future;. •require the consent of our existing lenders to borrow additional funds, as was required in connection with the issuance of the 2019 Notes; and. •limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes.. In addition, the agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains, and the agreements that may govern any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain, financial and other restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long - term best interests. Among other restrictions, the agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains covenants limiting our ability to make certain investments, consummate certain mergers, incur certain debt or liens and dispose of certain assets.. If we are unable to maintain cash reserves or generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments, or if we fail to comply with the various covenants and requirements of the 2019 Notes, our revolving credit facility or any indebtedness which we may incur in the future, an event of default could occur that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt. Any default under the 2019 Notes, our revolving credit facility or any indebtedness which we may incur in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.. Risks Related to our Common Stock. Our stock price may continue to be volatile and could decline.. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated and may decline in the future. The high and low sale prices of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market were $72.04 and $24.68 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016,  $87.74 and $60.21 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 and $94.39 and $76.15 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The. 17. Table of Contents. fluctuation of the market price of our common stock has been affected by many factors that are beyond our control, including:. •market prices of gold, silver, copper, nickel and other metals;. •Central bank interest rates;. •expectations regarding inflation;. •ability of operators to service their financial obligations, advance development projects, produce precious metals and develop new reserves;. •currency values;. •credit market conditions;. •general stock market conditions; and. •global and regional political and economic conditions.. Additional issuances of equity securities by us could dilute our existing stockholders, reduce some or all of our per share financial measures, reduce the trading price of our common stock or impede our ability to raise future capital. Substantial sales of shares may negatively impact the market price of our common stock.. We may issue additional equity in the future in connection with acquisitions, strategic transactions or for other purposes. To the extent we issue additional equity securities, our existing stockholders could be diluted and some or all of our per share financial measures could be reduced. In addition, the shares of common stock that we issue in connection with an acquisition may not be subject to resale restrictions. The market price of our common stock could decline if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, including shares issued upon the conversion of the outstanding 2019 Notes or are perceived by the market as intending to sell these shares other than in an orderly manner.. Conversion of the 2019 Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders.. At our election, we may settle the 2019 Notes tendered for conversion entirely or partly in shares of our common stock. An aggregate of approximately 3.5 million shares of our common stock are issuable upon conversion of the outstanding 2019 Notes at the initial conversion rate of 9.4955 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $105.31 per share of common stock). In addition, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the 2019 Notes, and therefore the dilution of existing common stockholders, could increase under certain circumstances described in the indenture under which the 2019 Notes are governed. We may issue all of these shares without any action or approval by our stockholders. As a result, the conversion of some or all of the 2019 Notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.. We may change our practice of paying dividends.. We have paid a cash dividend on our common stock for each fiscal year beginning in fiscal year 2000. Our board of directors has discretion in determining whether to declare a dividend based on a number of factors, including prevailing gold and other metal prices, economic market conditions, future earnings, cash flows, financial condition, and funding requirements for future opportunities or operations. In addition, there may be corporate law limitations or future contractual restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. If our board of directors declines or is unable to declare dividends in the future or reduces the current dividend level, our stock price could fall, and the success of an investment in our common stock would depend largely upon any future stock price appreciation. We have increased our dividends in prior years. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to do so or that we will pay any dividends at all.. 18. Table of Contents. Certain provisions of Delaware law, our organizational documents, and the indenture governing the 2019 Notes could impede, delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us.. Certain provisions of Delaware law, our organizational documents, and the indenture governing the 2019 Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. By default, Delaware law prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any \"interested stockholder,\" which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation's voting stock, for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder. Additionally, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could similarly delay, defer or discourage a change in control of us or our management. These provisions could also discourage a proxy contest and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. Such provisions provide for the following, among other things: (i) the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of common stock and preferred stock without stockholder approval, (ii) the ability of our board of directors to establish the rights and preferences of authorized and unissued preferred stock, (iii) a board of directors divided into three classes of directors serving staggered three year terms, (iv) permitting only the chairman of the board of directors, chief executive officer, president or board of directors to call a stockholders' meeting and (v) requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals and related information. In addition, if an acquisition event constitutes a fundamental change, holders of the 2019 Notes will have the right to require us to purchase their 2019 Notes in cash. If an acquisition event constitutes a make - whole fundamental change, we may be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their 2019 Notes in connection with such make - whole fundamental change. These provisions could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline."
