[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors.. Risks Relating to Our Investments. We may lose all of our investment in Avanti.. As of December 31, 2017, Avanti is our largest investment. Our investments in Avanti represented approximately 26% of our investment portfolio (excluding cash and short-term investments) at December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we owned approximately 10% of Avanti's outstanding debt and approximately 1% of Avanti's outstanding common stock. We acquired our original position in Avanti as part of the Initial GECC Portfolio, which we purchased from the MAST Funds prior to the Merger.. On July 7, 2016 Avanti announced that under certain circumstances it may not have access to sufficient liquidity to meet its funding requirements through the second quarter of 2017. On July 11, 2016, Avanti announced the undertaking of a strategic review to consider all financial and strategic options, including a sale of the company pursuant to the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the \"City Code\"). Following these announcements, on July 14, 2016, Moody's downgraded Avanti's 10% senior secured bonds due 2019 (the \"Existing Notes\").. On September 16, 2016, Avanti announced that it was launching a consent solicitation process to facilitate paying the October 1, 2016 coupon on the Existing Notes in kind in lieu of cash. In order to further support the strategic review process, Avanti also announced that it had entered into binding agreements with certain suppliers to defer approximately $39.0 million of capital expenditure payments to the third quarter of fiscal 2017.. On October 17, 2016, Avanti announced the completion of its consent solicitation process with respect to the Existing Notes, receiving consents from the holders of 89.5% of the Existing Notes to permit paying the interest due on October 1, 2016 with respect to consenting holders' Existing Notes in the form of additional Existing Notes in lieu of cash.  Because Avanti failed to obtain consent from at least 90% of the holders of the Existing Notes, it was required to pay $3.39 million of the October coupon in the form of cash rather than additional notes.. On December 20, 2016, Avanti announced the completion of its strategic review, which included termination of the formal sale process and end of the offer period (in each case as defined under the City Code), as well as the launch of a consent solicitation, exchange offer and new money offer as part of a larger financial restructuring of the Existing Notes.. On January 6, 2017, Avanti announced that it had received consents from holders of 91.85% of the Existing Notes in connection with the consent solicitation to permit, among other things, the incurrence of up to $132.5 million in super-senior indebtedness and the payment of PIK interest on the Existing Notes in lieu of cash for certain future interest payments due on the Existing Notes.. On January 27, 2017, Avanti announced the completion of its previously announced refinancing, with the settlement of its (1) consent solicitation to permit, among other things, the incurrence of up to $132.5 million in super senior indebtedness and the payment of PIK interest on the Existing Notes in lieu of cash for certain future interest payments due on the Existing Notes, (2) offer to holders of Existing Notes the opportunity to purchase up to $132.5 million aggregate principal amount of 10%/15% Senior Secured Notes due 2021 (the \"PIK Toggle Notes\") (the \"New Money Offer\") and (3) offer to holders participating in the New Money Offer to exchange a portion of their Existing Notes for additional PIK Toggle Notes.  Holders who elected to backstop the New Money Offer also received their pro rata share of additional common equity issued by Avanti in an aggregate amount equal to 9.09% of Avanti's total outstanding shares.. Through completion of the consent solicitation and the New Money Offer, Avanti received $80.0 million of new cash funding, with an additional $50.0 million of funding available on a delayed draw basis, and has the ability to defer up to $112.0 million of future interest payments through April 2018.. We took part in the refinancing, exchanging $22.9 million of Existing Notes for new PIK Toggle Notes and purchasing an additional $9.2 million of PIK Toggle Notes for $8.9 million of funded cash. At the completion of the refinancing, we continued to hold $47.2 million of Existing Notes and had committed to provide $5.6 million in additional financing, subject to certain conditions. Additionally, as part of the refinancing, our CEO and representatives of two other significant creditors joined Avanti's board of directors.. 19. In June 2017, Avanti announced that it had entered into a $100 million three year super senior facility with HPS Investment Partners, LLC. The proceeds of the super senior facility replaced an existing, undrawn $50 million debt facility, including the $5.6 million unfunded commitment held by us, and provided additional liquidity to fund the construction and launch of Avanti's HYLAS 4 satellite. Following Avanti's entry into this new super senior facility, our PIK Toggle Notes became third lien notes and the Existing Notes became second lien notes.. In August 2017, David Williams stepped down as chief executive officer of Avanti and was replaced by Alan Harper, a non-executive director of Avanti, on an interim basis.  In February 2018, Kyle Whitehill was named as Avanti's new chief executive officer effective April 3, 2018 and Alan Harper agreed to resume his prior role as non-executive director on that date.. In December 2017, we and other holders of the PIK Toggle Notes and the Existing Notes entered into a restructuring agreement with Avanti.  Under that agreement, among other things:. <U+25AA>  the Existing Notes will be converted into common shares of Avanti. All of the outstanding Existing Notes, if converted, would represent approximately 92% of the pro forma common shares of Avanti, and our Existing Notes would represent approximately 9.1% of the pro forma common shares of Avanti. The Existing Notes represented approximately 10.0% of our NAV at December 31, 2017; and. <U+25AA>  the cash interest rate on the PIK Toggle Notes will be reduced from 10% to 9% and the PIK interest rate will be reduced from 15% to 9% on the PIK Toggle Notes, the maturity date will be extended by one year to October 1, 2022 and Avanti will be permitted to issue up to $30 million of indebtedness that ranks equal with or junior to the PIK Toggle Notes and will be provided with relaxed financial covenants, including the elimination of certain financial maintenance covenants.. Completion of the restructuring is subject to a number of conditions beyond our control, including approval of a scheme of arrangement by a United Kingdom court and a corresponding proceeding under Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Aspects of the restructuring are subject to Avanti shareholder approval, including, among other things, the issuance of Avanti shares in the Existing Notes conversion, and Avanti bondholder approval. A meeting of the holders of the Existing Notes is scheduled to be held on March 20, 2018 to consider and approve a scheme of arrangement. Should bondholder approval be obtained, the scheme of arrangement will be subject to the further sanction of a United Kingdom court at a hearing expected to be held on March 26, 2018.  Avanti shareholder approval of the issuance of Avanti shares in the Existing Notes conversion is expected to be sought at a general company meeting in April 2018.  Equity securities expose us to additional risks should Avanti default on its debt or need additional 2018/ financing. Equity securities rank lower in the capital structure and would likely not pay current income or PIK income, which we have been receiving on our investment in Avanti. Please see, \"We are not in a position to exercise control over our portfolio companies or to prevent decisions by management of our portfolio companies that could decrease the value of our investments\" and \"Our investments are very risky and highly speculative, and the lower middle-market companies we target may have difficulty accessing the capital markets to meet their future capital needs, which may limit their ability to grow or to repay their outstanding indebtedness upon maturity.\". Following the restructuring, Avanti may seek to raise up to an additional $30 million from the sale of its common shares, additional PIK Toggle Notes or other securities that rank equal with or are junior to the PIK Toggle Notes.. 20. Avanti is highly leveraged. All or a portion of our investment in Avanti and our PIK income received from Avanti may be converted into equity securities as part of one or more restructurings of Avanti's balance sheet, including the restructuring agreed to in December 2017 or replacement or further restructurings. If there is an event of default under the indentures governing the PIK Toggle Notes or the Existing Notes and the obligations under the PIK Toggle Notes and/or the Existing Notes are accelerated, Avanti likely will not have sufficient liquidity to pay the obligations under the PIK Toggle Notes or the Existing Notes, as the case may be. Under such circumstances, Avanti may consider other restructuring options, such as entering into an insolvency procedure under English law or by filing for Chapter 11 protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code, the consequences of which could include a reduction in the value of the assets available to satisfy the PIK Toggle Notes and/or the Existing Notes and the imposition of costs and other additional risks on holders of the PIK Toggle Notes and the Existing Notes, including a material reduction in the value of the PIK Toggle Notes and the Existing Notes and their potential conversion to equity interests in Avanti, which may not be on the terms of the December 2017 restructuring agreement should the transactions contemplated thereby not be completed, including as a result of not obtaining the required votes. In such an event, we may lose all or part of our investment in Avanti.  The long-term impact of this refinancing transaction on Avanti's financial condition is uncertain and cannot be predicted. The refinancing transaction did not materially change Avanti's long term capital structure and it is unclear whether the refinancing transaction address the longer term sustainability of Avanti's business model. We may sell at a loss all or a portion of our investment in Avanti from time to time in order to meet diversification requirements under the Code or as part of our portfolio management strategy.. We are currently receiving PIK interest on a portion of our Avanti investment, which represented approximately 26% of our investment portfolio (excluding cash and short-term investments) as of December 31, 2017 and approximately 43% of our total investment income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Such PIK interest exposes us to significant risks.  Please see \" -  Risks Relating to our Business and Structure  -  We may expose ourselves to risks associated with the inclusion of non-cash income prior to receipt of cash,\" and \" -  Risks Relating to our Business and Structure  -  We may have difficulty paying our required distributions under applicable tax rules if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income.\"  Additionally, if the December 2017 restructuring is completed, our Existing Notes will be converted into Avanti common shares and both the cash and PIK interest rates on the PIK Toggle Notes will be reduced.  The December 2017 restructuring, if consummated, could result in a significant decrease in our net asset value if the market value of the Avanti common shares we receive in the restructuring decreases following the restructuring, and a significant decrease in our total investment income. These factors could also result in lower trading prices for our common stock and/or debt securities. Notwithstanding the risks associated with the December 2017 restructuring, if consummated, we believe the value of the Avanti common shares we would receive in exchange for the Existing Notes would be substantially equal to the value of the Existing Notes (including accrued PIK interest) to be converted in the restructuring. There can be no certainty in this respect and a significant decrease in the market value of the Avanti common shares we receive in the restructuring, if consummated, could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our net asset value and the trading prices of our securities.. 21. We face increasing competition for investment opportunities.  Limited availability of attractive investment opportunities in the market could cause us to hold a larger percentage of our assets in liquid securities until market conditions improve.  We compete for investments with other BDCs and investment funds (including private equity funds, mezzanine funds and small business investment companies), as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and other sources of funding. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, including from the Small Business Administration. In addition, increased competition for attractive investment opportunities allows debtors to demand more favorable terms and offer fewer contractual protections to creditors.  Some of our competitors have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than we do. These characteristics could allow our competitors to consider a wider variety of investments, establish more relationships and offer better pricing and more flexible structuring than we are able to offer. We may lose investment opportunities if we do not match our competitors' pricing, terms and structure. If we are forced to match our competitors' pricing, terms and structure, we may not be able to achieve acceptable returns on our investments or may bear substantial risk of capital loss. A significant part of our competitive advantage stems from the fact that the market for investments in lower middle - market companies is underserved by traditional commercial banks and other financing sources. A significant increase in the number and/or the size of our competitors in this target market would force us to accept less attractive investment terms. GECM may, at its discretion, decide to pursue such opportunities if it believes that they are in our best interest; however, GECM may decline to pursue available investment opportunities that, although otherwise consistent with our investment policies and objectives, in GECM's view present unacceptable risk/return profiles. Under such circumstances, we may hold a larger percentage of our assets in liquid securities until market conditions improve in order to avoid having assets remain uninvested.  Furthermore, many of our competitors have greater experience operating under, or are not subject to, the regulatory restrictions that the Investment Company Act imposes on us as a BDC. We believe that competitors will make first and second lien loans with interest rates and returns that are lower than the rates and returns that we target. Therefore, we do not seek to compete solely on the interest rates and returns offered to potential portfolio companies.. Changes in the regulatory framework under which the wireless telecommunications industry operates and significant competition in the wireless telecommunications industry could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations.  We hold a large position in Avanti. As a result of our stake in Avanti, we are exposed to risks associated with the wireless telecommunications sector.. For example, Avanti's operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes restrict or impose conditions on Avanti's ability to operate in designated areas and to provide specified products or services. In addition, new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework could impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede Avanti's ability to provide services. The further regulation of Avanti's activities could impact Avanti's ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return Avanti, and, as a result, we, can expect to achieve.. In addition, Avanti's business may also be affected by the significant competition in the wireless telecommunications industry. There is rapid development of new technologies, services and products, which brings new competitors to the market. While these changes have enabled companies like Avanti to offer new types of products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. Avanti's ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, how successfully Avanti anticipates and responds to various factors affecting its industry, including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. If Avanti is not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges, Avanti may face challenges in meeting its required payments under its debt securities held by us, which could result in a material decrease in the fair value of such debt securities, and a corresponding material adverse change in our financial position and results of operations.. Our portfolio will be limited in diversification among portfolio companies which may subject us to a risk of significant loss if one or more of these companies defaults on its obligations under any of its debt instruments.  Our portfolio is likely to hold a limited number of portfolio companies. Beyond the asset diversification requirements associated with qualification as a RIC, we do not have fixed guidelines for diversification, and our investments are likely to be concentrated in relatively few companies. As our portfolio is less diversified than the portfolios of some funds, we are more susceptible to failure if a single investment fails. Similarly, the aggregate returns we realize may be significantly adversely affected if a small number of investments perform poorly or if we need to write down the value of any one investment.. 22. Our portfolio will be concentrated in a limited number of industries, which subjects us to a risk of significant loss if there is a downturn in a particular industry in which a number of our investments are concentrated.  Our portfolio is likely to be concentrated in a limited number of industries. A downturn in any particular industry in which we are invested could significantly impact our aggregate realized returns.. In addition, we may from time to time invest a relatively significant percentage of our portfolio in industries in which GECM does not necessarily have extensive historical research coverage. If an industry in which we have significant investments suffers from adverse business or economic conditions, as these industries have to varying degrees, a material portion of our investment portfolio could be affected adversely, which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.. Any unrealized losses we experience in our portfolio may be an indication of future realized losses, which could reduce our income available for distribution.  As a BDC, we are required to carry our investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board. Decreases in the fair values of our investments are recorded as unrealized depreciation. Any unrealized losses in our portfolio could be an indication of a portfolio company's inability to meet its repayment obligations to us with respect to the affected investments. This could result in realized losses in the future and ultimately in reductions of our income available for distribution in future periods.. Prepayments of our debt investments by our portfolio companies could adversely impact our results of operations and reduce our returns on equity.  We are subject to the risk that investments intended to be held over long periods are, instead, repaid prior to maturity. When this occurs, we will generally reinvest these proceeds in temporary investments, repay debt or purchase our shares, depending on expected future investment opportunities. These temporary investments will typically have substantially lower yields than the debt being prepaid and we could experience significant delays in reinvesting these amounts. Any future investment may also be at lower yields than the debt that was repaid. As a result, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if one or more of our portfolio companies elects to prepay amounts owed by them. Additionally, prepayments could negatively impact our return on equity, which could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock.. We are not in a position to exercise control over our portfolio companies or to prevent decisions by management of our portfolio companies that could decrease the value of our investments.  We generally do not hold controlling equity positions in our portfolio companies. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company may make business decisions with which we disagree, and that the management and/or stockholders of a portfolio company may take risks or otherwise act in ways that are adverse to our interests. Due to the lack of liquidity of the debt and equity investments that we typically hold in our portfolio companies, we may not be able to dispose of our investments if we disagree with the actions of a portfolio company and may therefore suffer a decrease in the value of our investments.. Defaults by our portfolio companies may harm our operating results.  A portfolio company's failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, termination of our investments and foreclosure on our secured assets, which could trigger cross - defaults under other agreements and jeopardize a portfolio company's ability to meet its obligations under the debt or equity securities that we hold. We may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms, which may include the waiver of financial covenants, with a defaulting portfolio company. If any of these occur, it could materially and adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.. By investing in companies that are experiencing significant financial or business difficulties, we will be exposed to distressed lending risks. As part of our lending activities, we may purchase notes or loans to companies that are experiencing significant financial or business difficulties, including companies involved in bankruptcy or other reorganization and liquidation proceedings. Although the terms of such financing may result in significant financial returns to us, they involve a substantial degree of risk. The level of analytical sophistication, both financial and legal, necessary for successful financing to companies experiencing significant business and financial difficulties is unusually high. We cannot assure you that we will correctly evaluate the value of the assets collateralizing our investments or the prospects for a successful reorganization or similar action. In any reorganization or liquidation proceeding relating to a portfolio company, we may lose all or part of the amounts advanced to the borrower or may be required to accept collateral with a value less than the amount of the investment advanced by us to the borrower.. 23. Our investments are very risky and highly speculative, and the lower middle - market companies we target may have difficulty accessing the capital markets to meet their future capital needs, which may limit their ability to grow or to repay their outstanding indebtedness upon maturity.. Senior Secured Loans and Notes.  There is a risk that the collateral securing our loans and notes may decrease in value over time, may be difficult to sell in a timely manner, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based upon the success of the business and market conditions, including as a result of the inability of the portfolio company to raise additional capital, and, in some circumstances, our lien could be subordinated to claims of other creditors. In addition, deterioration in a portfolio company's financial condition and prospects, including its inability to raise additional capital, may be accompanied by deterioration in the value of the collateral for the loan or note. Consequently, the fact that a loan or note is secured does not guarantee that we will receive principal and interest payments according to the loan's or note's terms, or at all, or that we will be able to collect on the loan or note should we be forced to enforce our remedies.. Mezzanine Loans.  Our mezzanine debt investments will be generally subordinated to senior loans and will be generally unsecured. As such, other creditors may rank senior to us in the event of an insolvency, which could likely result in a substantial or complete loss on such investment in the case of such insolvency. This may result in an above average amount of risk and loss of principal.. Unsecured Loans and Notes.  We may invest in unsecured loans and notes. If the issuer defaults or has an event of insolvency, other creditors may rank senior, be structurally senior or have lien protection that effectively renders their claim superior to our rights under our unsecured notes or loans, which could likely result in a substantial or complete loss on such investment in the case of such insolvency. This may result in an above average amount of risk and loss of principal.. Equity Investments.  When we invest in senior secured loans or mezzanine loans, we may acquire equity securities, including warrants, as well. In addition, we may invest directly in the equity securities of portfolio companies. The equity interests we receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests, and any gains that we realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience.. In addition, investing in middle - market companies involves a number of significant risks, including:. <U+25AA>  these companies may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their debt securities that we hold, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of us realizing any guarantees we may have obtained in connection with our investment;. <U+25AA>  they typically have shorter operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares than larger businesses, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors' actions and market conditions, as well as general economic downturns;. <U+25AA>  they are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons; therefore, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on our portfolio company;. <U+25AA>  they generally have less predictable operating results, may from time to time be parties to litigation, may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence, and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position. In addition, our executive officers, directors and GECM may be named as defendants in litigation arising from our investments in the portfolio companies;. 24. <U+25AA>  they may have difficulty accessing the capital markets to meet future capital needs, which may limit their ability to grow or to repay their outstanding indebtedness upon maturity; and. <U+25AA>  a portion of our income may be non - cash income, such as contractual PIK interest, which represents interest added to the debt balance and due at the end of the instrument's term, in the case of loans, or issued as additional notes in the case of bonds. Instruments bearing PIK interest typically carry higher interest rates as a result of their payment deferral and increased credit risk. When we recognize income in connection with PIK interest, there is a risk that such income may become uncollectable if the borrower defaults.. Investing in middle - market companies involves a high degree of risk and our financial results may be affected adversely if one or more of our portfolio investments defaults on its loans or notes or fails to perform as we expect.  Our portfolio consists primarily of debt and equity investments in privately owned lower middle - market companies. Investing in lower middle - market companies involves a number of significant risks. Typically, the debt instruments in which we invest are not initially rated by any rating agency; however, we believe that if such investments were rated, they would be below investment grade, which are referred to as \"junk bonds.\" Compared to larger publicly owned companies, these middle - market companies may be in a weaker financial position and experience wider variations in their operating results, which may make them more vulnerable to economic downturns and other business disruptions. Typically, these companies need more capital to compete; however, their access to capital is limited and their cost of capital is often higher than that of their competitors. Our portfolio companies face intense competition from larger companies with greater financial, technical and marketing resources and their success typically depends on the managerial talents and efforts of an individual or a small group of persons. Therefore, the loss of any of their key employees could affect a portfolio company's ability to compete effectively and harm its financial condition. Further, some of these companies conduct business in regulated industries that are susceptible to regulatory changes. These factors could impair the cash flow of our portfolio companies and result in other events, such as bankruptcy. These events could limit a portfolio company's ability to repay its obligations to us. Deterioration in a borrower's financial condition and prospects may be accompanied by deterioration in the value of the loan's collateral and the fair market value of the loan.. Most of the loans in which we invest are not structured to fully amortize during their lifetime. In order to create liquidity to pay the final principal payment, borrowers typically must raise additional capital or sell their assets, which could potentially result in the collateral being sold for less than its fair market value. If they are unable to raise sufficient funds to repay us, the loan will go into default, which will require us to foreclose on the borrower's assets, even if the loan was otherwise performing prior to maturity. This will deprive us from immediately obtaining full recovery on the loan and prevent or delay the reinvestment of the loan proceeds in other, more profitable investments. Moreover, there are no assurances that any recovery on such loan will be obtained. Most of these companies cannot obtain financing from public capital markets or from traditional credit sources, such as commercial banks. Accordingly, loans made to these types of companies pose a higher default risk than loans made to companies that have access to traditional credit sources.. An investment strategy that includes privately held companies presents challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies, a dependence on the talents and efforts of only a few key portfolio company personnel and a greater vulnerability to economic downturns.  We will invest in privately held companies. Generally, little public information exists about these companies, and we are required to rely on GECM's ability to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential returns from investing in these companies. If we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, we may not make a fully informed investment decision, and may lose money on our investments. Also, privately held companies frequently have less diverse product lines and smaller market presence than larger competitors. These factors could adversely affect our investment returns as compared to companies investing primarily in the securities of public companies.. 25. Our portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies.  Our portfolio companies may have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks equally with, or in some cases senior to, the debt in which we invest. By their terms, such debt instruments may entitle the holders to receive payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments with respect to the debt instruments in which we invested. Also, in insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution. After repaying such senior creditors, such portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of debt ranking equally with debt instruments in which we invest, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant portfolio company.. There may be circumstances where our debt investments could be subordinated to claims of other creditors or we could be subject to lender liability claims.  Even though we may have structured investments as secured investments, if one of our portfolio companies were to go bankrupt, depending on the facts and circumstances, and based upon principles of equitable subordination as defined by existing case law, a bankruptcy court could subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors and transfer any lien securing such subordinated claim to the bankruptcy estate. The principles of equitable subordination defined by case law have generally indicated that a claim may be subordinated only if its holder is guilty of misconduct or where the senior investment is re - characterized as an equity investment and the senior lender has actually provided significant managerial assistance to the bankrupt debtor. We may also be subject to lender liability claims for actions taken by us with respect to a borrower's business or instances where we exercise control over the borrower. It is possible that we could become subject to a lender's liability claim, including as a result of actions taken in rendering managerial assistance or actions to compel and collect payments from the borrower outside the ordinary course of business.. Second priority liens on collateral securing loans and notes that we invest in may be subject to control by senior creditors with first priority liens. If there is a default, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to repay in full both the first priority creditors and us.  We may purchase loans or notes that are secured by a second priority security interest in the same collateral pledged by a portfolio company to secure senior debt owed by the portfolio company to commercial banks or other traditional lenders. Often the senior lender has procured covenants from the portfolio company prohibiting the incurrence of additional secured debt without the senior lender's consent. Prior to and as a condition of permitting the portfolio company to borrow money from us secured by the same collateral pledged to the senior lender, the senior lender will require assurances that it will control the disposition of any collateral in the event of bankruptcy or other default. In many such cases, the senior lender will require us or the indenture trustee to enter into an \"intercreditor agreement\" prior to permitting the portfolio company to borrow. Typically the intercreditor agreements expressly subordinate our debt instruments to those held by the senior lender and further provide that the senior lender shall control: (1) the commencement of foreclosure or other proceedings to liquidate and collect on the collateral; (2) the nature, timing and conduct of foreclosure or other collection proceedings; (3) the amendment of any collateral document; (4) the release of the security interests in respect of any collateral; and (5) the waiver of defaults under any security agreement. Because of the control we may cede to senior lenders under intercreditor agreements we may enter, we may be unable to realize the proceeds of any collateral securing some of our loans and notes.. The reference rates for our loans may be manipulated.  Concerns have been publicized that some of the member banks surveyed by the British Bankers' Association (the \"BBA\") in connection with the calculation of the London Inter Bank Borrowing Rate (\"LIBOR\") across a range of maturities and currencies may have been under - reporting or otherwise manipulating the inter - bank lending rate applicable to them in order to profit on their derivatives positions or to avoid an appearance of capital insufficiency or adverse reputational or other consequences that may have resulted from reporting inter - bank lending rates higher than those they actually submitted. A number of BBA member banks have entered into settlements with their regulators and law enforcement agencies with respect to alleged manipulation of LIBOR, and investigations by regulators and governmental authorities in various jurisdictions are ongoing.. Central banks have engaged in quantitative easing, currency purchase programs and other activities that caused government borrowing rates and currencies to trade at prices different than those that would prevail in an unaffected market.. 26. Actions by market participants, like the BBA, or by governments, like the Federal Reserve Board, may affect prevailing interest rates and the reference rates for loans to our portfolio companies.  Actions by governments may create inflation in asset prices that over-state the value of our portfolio companies and their assets and drive cycles of capital market activities (like mergers and acquisitions) at a rate and at prices in excess of those that would prevail in an unaffected market.. We cannot assure you that actions by market participants, like the BBA, or by governments, like the Federal Reserve Board, will not materially adversely affect trading markets or our portfolio companies or us or our and our portfolio companies' respective business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.. In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. There is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of LIBOR or of any particular replacement rate. As such, the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital and net investment income cannot yet be determined.. We may mismatch the interest rate and maturity exposure of our assets and liabilities.  Our net investment income depends, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest those funds. We cannot assure you that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds could increase, which could reduce our net investment income. We expect that our fixed - rate investments will be financed primarily with equity and/or long - term debt. We may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act. If we implement these techniques properly, we could experience losses on our hedging positions, which could be material.. If interest rates fall, our portfolio companies are likely to refinance their obligations to us at lower interest rates.  Our proceeds from these refinancings are likely to be reinvested at lower interest rates than our refinanced loans resulting in a material decrease in our net investment income.. We may not realize gains from our equity investments.  Our portfolio may include warrants or other equity securities. We may take back equity securities in exchange for our debt investments in workouts of troubled investments. Investments in equity securities involve a number of significant risks, including the risk of further dilution as a result of additional issuances, inability to access additional capital and failure to pay current distributions. Investments in preferred securities involve special risks, such as the risk of deferred distributions, credit risk, illiquidity and limited voting rights. In addition, we may from time to time make non - control, equity investments in portfolio companies. The equity interests we invest in may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience. We also may be unable to realize any value if a portfolio company does not have a liquidity event, such as a sale of the business, recapitalization or public offering, which would allow us to sell the underlying equity interests. We may seek puts or similar rights to give it the right to sell our equity securities back to the portfolio company. We may be unable to exercise these put rights if the issuer is in financial distress or otherwise lacks sufficient liquidity to purchase the underlying equity investment.. Investments in foreign securities may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in U.S. investments.  Our investment strategy contemplates investments in debt securities of foreign companies. Investing in foreign companies may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies. These risks include changes in exchange control regulations, political and social instability, expropriation, imposition of foreign taxes, less liquid markets and less available information than is generally the case in the United States, higher transaction costs, less government supervision of exchanges, brokers and issuers, less developed bankruptcy laws, difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations, lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards and greater price volatility. Such investments will generally not represent \"qualifying assets\" under Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act.  Pursuant to the Investment Company Act, qualifying assets must represent at least 70% of our total assets at the time of acquisition of any additional non-qualifying assets. If we do not meet the 70% threshold, we will be limited to purchasing qualifying assets until such threshold is met. See \"Regulation as a Business Development Company.\". 27. Any investments denominated in a foreign currency will be subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency will change in relation to one or more other currencies. Among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances, the level of short - term interest rates, differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies, long - term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation, and political developments. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we offer no assurance that we will, in fact, hedge currency risk, or that if it does, such strategies will be effective.. We may hold a significant portion of our portfolio assets in cash, cash equivalents, money market mutual funds, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less, which may have a negative impact on our business and operations.  We may hold a significant portion of our portfolio assets in cash, cash equivalents, money market mutual funds, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less for many reasons, including, among others:. <U+25AA>  as part of the GECM's strategy in order to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise,. <U+25AA>  when GECM believes that market conditions are unfavorable for profitable investing,. <U+25AA>  when GECM is otherwise unable to locate attractive investment opportunities,. <U+25AA>  as a defensive measure in response to adverse market or economic conditions, or. <U+25AA>  to meet RIC qualification requirements.. We may also be required to hold higher levels of cash, money market mutual funds or other short-term securities in order to pay our expenses or make distributions to stockholders in the ordinary course of business given the relatively high percentage of our total investment income represented by PIK income.  During periods when we maintain exposure to cash, money market mutual funds, or other short-term securities, we may not participate in market movements to the same extent that it would if we were fully invested, which may have a negative impact on our business and operations and, accordingly, our returns may be reduced.. Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure. GEC and the MAST Funds collectively own the majority of our outstanding common stock and may attempt to exert control over us in a manner that is adverse to your interests.  Great Elm Capital Group, Inc. (\"GEC\") and the MAST Funds collectively own the majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock and accordingly may control the results of matters submitted to the vote of our stockholders. GEC and the MAST Funds agreed to vote their shares proportionately to our other stockholders on certain matters until they collectively own less than 35 percent of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Although there is no agreement between GEC and the MAST Funds to act in concert with respect to the shares of our common stock they own, funds managed by MAST (including some of the MAST Funds) are a significant stockholder of GEC and Peter A. Reed, our chief executive officer, is chief executive officer and a member of the board of directors of GEC. GEC and the MAST Funds may use their share ownership, ownership of GECM or otherwise exert control over us in a manner that is adverse to your interests.. Capital markets experience periods of disruption and instability. These market conditions have materially and adversely affected debt and equity capital markets in the United States and abroad, which had, and may in the future have, a negative impact on our business and operations.  The global capital markets are subject to disruption as evidenced by, among other things, a lack of liquidity in the debt capital markets, significant write - offs in the financial services sector, the re - pricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated credit market and the failure of major financial institutions. Despite actions of the United States federal government and foreign governments, these events contributed to worsening general economic conditions that materially and adversely impacted the broader financial and credit markets and reduced the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole and financial services firms in particular. We cannot provide any assurance that these conditions will not significantly worsen. Equity capital may be difficult to raise because, as a BDC, we are generally not able to issue additional shares of our common stock at a price less than net asset value.. 28. The expected illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if required. As a result, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded our investments. In addition, significant changes in the capital markets, including the recent extreme volatility and disruption, have had, and may in the future have, a negative effect on the valuations of our investments and on the potential for liquidity events involving our investments. An inability to raise capital, and any required sale of our investments for liquidity purposes, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. A significant portion of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the public market in the near future, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.  Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the market perception that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. We have registered all of the shares of our common stock issued to the MAST Funds and GEC in the Formation Transactions for resale. The shares issued in the Formation Transaction represent approximately sixty six percent of our outstanding shares of common stock at December 31, 2017.. The MAST Funds are not prohibited from transferring their shares of our common stock. Any sale by the MAST Funds of all or a portion of their shares could cause the market price of shares of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.. You may not receive distributions or our distributions may not grow over time.  We intend to make distributions on a monthly basis to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. We cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions or year - over - year increases in cash distributions. In addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions. See \"Regulation as a Business Development Company.\". We may borrow money, which would magnify the potential for loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing with us.  We have existing indebtedness and may in the future borrow additional money, each of which magnifies the potential for loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing with us. Our ability to service our existing and potential future debt depends largely on our financial performance and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures. The amount of leverage that we could employ at any particular time will depend on GECM's and our Board's assessment of market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.. Any GECC credit facility would impose financial and operating covenants that would restrict our business activities, including limitations that could hinder our ability to finance additional loans and investments or to make the distributions required to maintain our status as a RIC under the Code. A failure to renew our credit facilities or to add new or replacement debt facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Borrowings, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and, therefore, increase the risks associated with investing in our securities. When a company issues debt, the issuer gives the debt holders a call right on the issuer's business and assets. Holders of such debt securities would have fixed dollar claims on our consolidated assets that would be superior to the claims of our common stockholders or any preferred stockholders.. If the value of our consolidated assets decreases while we have debt outstanding, leveraging would cause our net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged. Similarly, any decrease in our consolidated income while we have debt outstanding would cause net income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not borrowed. Such a decline could negatively affect our ability to make common stock distributions. We cannot assure you that our leveraging strategy will be successful.. 29. Illustration.  The following table illustrates the effect of leverage on returns from an investment in our common stock assuming various annual returns, net of expenses. The calculations in the table below are hypothetical and actual returns may be higher or lower than those appearing below.. Assumed Return on Our Portfolio(1) (2) (net of expenses)     (10.00)%        (5.00)%        0.00%        5.00%        10.00%     Corresponding net return to common stockholder     (14.28)%        (8.05)%        (1.81)%        4.42%        10.65%. (1)  Assumes $164.9 million in total portfolio assets, $32.6 million in senior securities outstanding, $132.3 million in net assets, and an average cost of funds of 7.36%. Actual interest payments may be different.. (2)  In order for us to cover our annual interest payments on indebtedness, we must achieve annual returns on our December 31, 2017 total portfolio assets of at least 1.45%.. We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results.  Our quarterly operating results will fluctuate due to a number of factors, including the level of expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets and general economic conditions. Our quarterly operating results will also fluctuate due to a number of other factors, including the interest rates payable on the debt investments we make and the default rates on such investments. As a result of these factors, results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods.. Our success depends on the ability of our investment adviser to attract and retain qualified personnel in a competitive environment.  Our growth requires that GECM retain and attract new investment and administrative personnel in a competitive market. The ability to attract and retain personnel with the requisite credentials, experience and skills depends on several factors including, but not limited to, its ability to offer competitive wages, benefits and professional growth opportunities. Many of the entities, including investment funds (such as private equity funds and mezzanine funds) and traditional financial services companies, with which GECM competes for experienced personnel, have greater resources than it has.. Our ability to grow depends on our ability to raise capital and/or access debt financing.  We intend to periodically access the capital markets to raise cash to fund new investments. We expect to continue to elect to be treated as a RIC and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the U.S. federal income tax treatment applicable to RICs. Among other things, in order to maintain our RIC status, we must distribute to our stockholders on a timely basis generally an amount equal to at least 90% of our investment company taxable income (as defined by the Code), and, as a result, such distributions will not be available to fund new investments. As a result, we must borrow from financial institutions or issue additional securities to fund our growth. Unfavorable economic or capital market conditions may increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or could result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. There has been and will continue to be uncertainty in the financial markets in general. An inability to successfully access the capital or credit markets for either equity or debt could limit our ability to grow our business and fully execute our business strategy and could decrease our earnings, if any.. If the fair value of our assets declines substantially, we may fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios imposed upon us by the Investment Company Act or our lenders. Any such failure, or a tightening or general disruption of the credit markets, would affect our ability to issue senior securities, including borrowings, and pay dividends or other distributions, which could materially impair our business.. In addition, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow or issue debt securities or preferred stock such that our asset coverage, as defined in the Investment Company Act, equals at least 200% immediately after such borrowing, which, in certain circumstances, may restrict our ability to borrow or issue debt securities or preferred stock. The amount of leverage that we may employ will depend on GECM's and our Board's assessments of market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing or issuance of debt securities or preferred stock. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain lines of credit at all or on terms acceptable to us.. 30. Economic recessions or downturns could impair our portfolio companies and harm our operating results.  The economy is subject to periodic downturns that, from time to time, result in recessions or more serious adverse macroeconomic events. Our portfolio companies are susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and may be unable to repay loans or notes during these periods. Therefore, our non - performing assets may increase and the value of our portfolio may decrease during these periods as we are required to record the market value of our investments. Adverse economic conditions may also decrease the value of collateral securing some of our investments and the value of our equity investments. Economic slowdowns or recessions could lead to financial losses in our portfolio and a decrease in revenues, net income and assets. Unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. These events could prevent us from increasing investments and harm our operating results.. A portfolio company's failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants in its agreements with us or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, acceleration of the time when the debt obligations are due and foreclosure on its secured assets, which could trigger cross - defaults under other agreements and jeopardize the portfolio company's ability to meet its obligations under the debt that we hold. We may incur additional expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting portfolio company. In addition, if one of our portfolio companies were to go bankrupt, depending on the facts and circumstances, including the extent to which we actually provided significant managerial assistance to that portfolio company, a bankruptcy court might re-characterize our debt holding and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors.. Uncertainty about the financial stability of the United States and of several countries in the European Union (EU) and China could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Due to federal budget deficit concerns, S&P Global Ratings downgraded the federal government's credit rating from AAA to AA+ for the first time in history on August 5, 2011. Further downgrades or warnings regarding further downgrades by S&P Global Ratings or other rating agencies, and the United States government's credit and deficit concerns in general, could cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may negatively impact both the perception of credit risk associated with our debt portfolio and our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms. In addition, a decreased U.S. government credit rating could create broader financial turmoil and uncertainty, which may weigh heavily on our financial performance and the value of our common stock.. Protectionism and other governmental causes of recessions and other negative economic factors may increase. Risks resulting from any future debt crisis in Europe or any similar crisis could have a detrimental impact on the global economic recovery, sovereign and non - sovereign debt in these countries and the financial condition of European financial institutions. Market and economic disruptions have affected, and may in the future affect, consumer confidence levels and spending, personal bankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence and defaults on consumer debt and home prices, among other factors. We cannot assure you that market disruptions in Europe, including the increased cost of funding for certain governments and financial institutions, will not impact the global economy. To the extent uncertainty regarding the United Kingdom or the EU negatively impacts consumer confidence, market conditions and credit factors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.. In October 2014, the Federal Reserve announced that it was concluding its bond - buying program, or quantitative easing, which was designed to stimulate the economy and expand the Federal Reserve's holdings of long - term securities. It is unclear what effect, if any, the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's bond - buying program has had or will have on the value of our investments. However, it is possible that, without quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve, these developments, along with the United States government's credit and deficit concerns and the European sovereign debt crisis, could cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms. The target range for the federal funds rate may increase and cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms. In June 2017, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate, which was only the fourth such interest rate hike in nearly a decade.. In the second quarter of 2015, stock prices in China experienced a significant drop, resulting primarily from a continued sell - off of shares trading in Chinese markets. In August 2015, Chinese authorities sharply devalued China's currency. These market and economic disruptions affected, and these or similar market and economic disruptions may in the future affect, the U.S. capital markets, which could adversely affect our business.. 31. In June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. It is not possible to ascertain the precise impact these events may have on us from an economic, financial or regulatory perspective but any such impact could have material adverse consequences for us or our portfolio companies.. The Trump administration has called for substantial changes to U.S. fiscal and tax policies.  Congress has passed, and the President has recently signed into law, a tax reform bill that will, among other things, significantly change the taxation of business entities (including by significantly lowering corporate tax rates), the deductibility of interest expense, and the timing in which certain income items are recognized (potentially including, in certain cases, income from debt and other financial instruments).  In addition, the Trump administration has called for significant change to U.S. trade, healthcare, immigration, foreign, and government regulatory policy. In this regard, there is significant uncertainty with respect to legislation, regulation and government policy at the federal level, as well as the state and local levels. Recent events have created a climate of heightened uncertainty and introduced new and difficult-to-quantify macroeconomic and political risks with potentially far-reaching implications. There has been a corresponding meaningful increase in the uncertainty surrounding interest rates, inflation, foreign exchange rates, trade volumes and fiscal and monetary policy. To the extent the U.S. Congress or Trump administration implements changes to U.S. policy, those changes may impact, among other things, the U.S. and global economy, international trade and relations, unemployment, immigration, corporate taxes, healthcare, the U.S. regulatory environment, inflation and other areas. Some particular areas identified as subject to potential change, amendment or repeal include the Dodd-Frank Act, including the Volcker Rule and various swaps and derivatives regulations, credit risk retention requirements and the authorities of the Federal Reserve, the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the SEC. Although we cannot predict the impact, if any, of these changes to our business, they could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Until we know what policy changes are made and how those changes impact our business and the business of our competitors over the long term, we will not know if, overall, we will benefit from them or be negatively affected by them.. Changes in tax laws, including recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation, could have a negative effect on us. Recently enacted tax reform legislation has made substantial changes to U.S. tax law, including new tax rates, immediate expensing of certain capital expenses and significant limitations on deductibility of interest. This legislation could have significant effects on us and on an investment in our shares, some of which may be adverse. The magnitude of the net impact remains uncertain at this time and is subject to any other regulatory or administrative developments, including any regulations or other guidance promulgated by the IRS.. We may acquire other funds, portfolios of assets or pools of debt and those acquisitions may not be successful.  We may acquire other funds, portfolios of assets or pools of debt investments. Any such acquisition program has a number of risks, including among others:. <U+25AA>  management's attention will be diverted from running our existing business by efforts to source, negotiate, close and integrate acquisitions;. <U+25AA>  our due diligence investigation of potential acquisitions may not reveal risks inherent in the acquired business or assets;. <U+25AA>  we may over - value potential acquisitions resulting in dilution to you, incurrence of excessive indebtedness, asset write downs and negative perception of our common stock;. <U+25AA>  your interest in GECC may be diluted by the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock;. <U+25AA>  GEC and the MAST Funds may control the outcome of the vote on issuance of additional shares of our common stock;. <U+25AA>  we may borrow to finance acquisitions and there are risks associated with borrowing as described in this document;. <U+25AA>  GECM has an incentive to increase our assets under management in order to increase its fee stream, which may not be aligned with your interest;. <U+25AA>  we and GECM may not successfully integrate any acquired business or assets; and. <U+25AA>  GECM may compensate the existing managers of any acquired business or assets in a manner that results in the combined company taking on excessive risk.. 32. Our failure to maintain our status as a BDC would reduce our operating flexibility.  We elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act. The Investment Company Act imposes numerous constraints on the operations of BDCs and their external advisers. For example, BDCs are required to invest at least 70% of their gross assets in specified types of securities, primarily in private companies or illiquid U.S. public companies below a certain market capitalization, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. Furthermore, any failure to comply with the requirements imposed on BDCs by the Investment Company Act could cause the SEC to bring an enforcement action against us and/or expose us to claims of private litigants. In addition, upon approval of a majority of our voting securities (as defined under the Investment Company Act), we may elect to withdraw our status as a BDC. If we decide to withdraw our BDC election, or if we otherwise fail to qualify, or to maintain our qualification, as a BDC, we may be subject to substantially greater regulation under the Investment Company Act as a closed - end management investment company. Compliance with such regulations would significantly decrease our operating flexibility and would significantly increase our costs of doing business.. Regulations governing our operations as a BDC affect our ability to raise additional capital and the way in which we do so. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.  We may issue debt securities or preferred stock and/or borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, referred to collectively as \"senior securities,\" up to the maximum amount permitted under the Investment Company Act. Under the provisions of the Investment Company Act applicable to BDCs, we are permitted to issue senior securities (e.g., notes and preferred stock) in amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the Investment Company Act, equals at least 200% of gross assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, after each issuance of senior securities. If the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy this test. If that happens, we may be required to sell a portion of our investments and, depending on the nature of our leverage, repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous. Also, any amounts that we use to service our indebtedness would not be available for distributions to our stockholders. Furthermore, as a result of issuing senior securities, we would also be exposed to typical risks associated with leverage, including an increased risk of loss.. If we issued preferred stock, the preferred stock would rank \"senior\" to common stock in our capital structure, preferred stockholders would have separate voting rights on certain matters and might have other rights including, for example, the right to elect one or more of our directors, preferences, or privileges more favorable than those of our common stockholders, and the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in your best interest.. We are not generally able to issue and sell shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell shares of our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then - current net asset value per share of our common stock if our Board determines that such sale is in our and our stockholders' best interests. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price that, in the determination of our Board, equals or closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount calculated). Certain sales of our common stock below net asset value per share also require approval by our stockholders in accordance with the Investment Company Act. If we raise additional funds by issuing more common stock or senior securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common stock, then our existing common stockholders' percentage ownership at that time will decrease, and they will experience dilution.. Our common stock price may be volatile and may decrease substantially, and you may lose money in connection with an investment in our shares.  The trading price of our common stock will likely fluctuate substantially. The price of our common stock may increase or decrease, depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:. <U+25AA>  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;. <U+25AA>  investor demand for our shares;. <U+25AA>  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of BDCs or other companies in our sector, which are not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies;. 33. <U+25AA>  exclusion of our common stock from certain indices, such as the Russell 2000 Financial Services Index, which could reduce the ability of certain investment funds to own our common stock and put short - term selling pressure on our common stock;. <U+25AA>  changes in regulatory policies or tax guidelines with respect to RICs or BDCs;. <U+25AA>  failure to qualify as a RIC, or the loss of RIC status;. <U+25AA>  any shortfall in revenue or net income or any increase in losses from levels expected by investors or securities analysts;. <U+25AA>  changes, or perceived changes, in the value of our portfolio investments;. <U+25AA>  departures of GECM's key personnel;. <U+25AA>  operating performance of companies comparable to GECC; or. <U+25AA>  general economic conditions and trends and other external factors.. If the price of shares of our common stock decreases, you may lose money if you were to sell your shares of our common stock.. In addition, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Due to the potential volatility of the price of our securities, we may become the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources from our business.. Our Board may change our investment objectives, operating policies and strategies without prior notice or stockholder approval, the effects of which may be adverse.  Our Board has the authority to modify or waive our investment objectives, current operating policies, investment criteria and strategies without prior notice and without stockholder approval. We cannot predict the effect any changes to our current operating policies, investment criteria and strategies would have on our business, net asset value, operating results and value of our common stock. However, the effects might be adverse, which could negatively impact our ability to pay our stockholders dividends or other distributions and cause you to lose all or part of your investment.. We may have difficulty paying our required distributions under applicable tax rules if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income.  For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may be required to include in income certain amounts before our receipt of the cash attributable to such amounts, such as original issue discount (\"OID\"), which may arise if we receive warrants in connection with the making of a loan or possibly in other circumstances, or PIK interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term. For example, such original issue discount or increases in loan balances as a result of PIK interest will be included in income before we receive any corresponding cash payments. Also, we may be required to include in income other amounts that we will not receive in cash, including, for example, non - cash income from PIK securities, deferred payment securities and hedging and foreign currency transactions. In addition, we intend to seek debt investments in the secondary market that represent attractive risk-adjusted returns, taking into account both stated interest rates and current market discounts to par value. Such market discount may be included in income before we receive any corresponding cash payments.  One of our debt investments in Avanti currently only earns PIK interest and, if converted to common stock, our investment in Avanti equity is not expected to earn cash dividends.. Since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the U.S. federal income tax requirement to distribute generally an amount equal to at least 90% of our investment company taxable income to maintain our status as a RIC. Accordingly, we may have to sell some of our investments at times we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce new investment originations to meet these distribution requirements. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify as a RIC and thus be subject to additional corporate - level taxes.3. However, in order to satisfy the annual distribution requirement for a RIC, we may, but have no current intention to, declare a large portion of a dividend in shares of our common stock instead of in cash. As long as a portion of such dividend is paid in cash (which portion may be as low as 20% of such dividend) and certain requirements are met, the entire distribution will be treated as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes.. 34. We may expose ourselves to risks associated with the inclusion of non-cash income prior to receipt of cash. To the extent we invest in OID instruments, including PIK, zero coupon bonds, and debt securities with attached warrants, investors will be exposed to the risks associated with the inclusion of such non-cash income in taxable and accounting income prior to receipt of cash.. The deferred nature of payments on PIK loans creates specific risks. Interest payments deferred on a PIK loan are subject to the risk that the borrower may default when the deferred payments are due in cash at the maturity of the loan. Since the payment of PIK income does not result in cash payments to us, we may also have to sell some of our investments at times we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce new investment originations (and thus hold higher cash or cash equivalent balances, which could reduce returns) to pay our expenses or make distributions to stockholders in the ordinary course of business, even if such loans do not default. An election to defer PIK interest payments by adding them to principal increases our gross assets and, thus, increases future base management fees to GECM and, because interest payments will then be payable on a larger principal amount, the PIK election also increases GECM's future income incentive fees at a compounding rate. The deferral of interest on a PIK loan increases its loan-to-value ratio, which is a measure of the riskiness of a loan.. More generally, market prices of OID instruments are more volatile because they are impacted to a greater extent by interest rate changes than instruments that pay interest periodically in cash. Ordinarily, OID would also create the risk of non-refundable cash payments to GECM based on non-cash accruals that may never be realized; however, this risk is mitigated since the Investment Management Agreement requires GECM to defer any incentive fees on accrued but unpaid income, the effect of which is that income incentive fees otherwise payable with respect to accrued unpaid income become payable only if, as, when and to the extent cash is received by us or our consolidated subsidiaries in respect thereof.. Additionally, we will be required under the tax laws to make distributions of non-cash income to shareholders without receiving any cash. Such required cash distributions may have to be paid from the sale of our assets without investors being given any notice of this fact. The required recognition of non-cash income, including PIK and OID interest, for U.S. federal income tax purposes may have a negative impact on liquidity because it represents a non-cash component of our taxable income that must, nevertheless, be distributed in cash to investors to avoid us being subject to corporate level taxation.. Further, our investment in Avanti, which represented approximately 26% of our investment portfolio (excluding cash and short-term investments) as of December 31, 2017 and 43% of our total investment income for the year ended December 31, 2017, has resulted in significant PIK interest, which significantly increases our exposure to the aforementioned risks. Conversion of Avanti's Existing Notes to equity will result in us owning more Avanti common shares which are not expected to generate cash dividends.. We may choose to pay distributions in our own stock, in which case you may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash you receive.  We may distribute a portion of our taxable distributions in the form of shares of our stock. Under applicable provisions of the Code, distributions payable in cash or in shares of stock at the election of stockholders may be treated as a taxable distribution. The IRS has issued private rulings indicating that this rule will apply even if the total amount of cash that may be distributed is limited to no more than 20% of the total distribution. Under these rulings, if too many stockholders elect to receive their distributions in cash, each such stockholder would receive a pro rata share of the total cash to be distributed and would receive the remainder of their distribution in shares of stock. If we decide to make any distributions consistent with these rulings that are payable in part in our stock, taxable stockholders receiving such distribution will be required to include the full amount of the distribution (whether received in cash, stock or a combination thereof) as ordinary income (or as a long - term capital gain to the extent such distribution is properly designated as a capital gain dividend) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for United States federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such distribution in excess of any cash received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock it receives as a distribution in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the distribution, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non - U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such distribution, including in respect to all or a portion of such distribution that is payable in stock. In addition, if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock, in order to pay taxes owed on distribution, such sales may put downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock.. 35. We may expose our-self to risks if we engage in hedging transactions.  If we engage in hedging transactions, we may expose our self to risks associated with such transactions. We may utilize instruments such as forward contracts, currency options and interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates. Hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. Such hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions increase. It may not be possible to hedge against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated because we may not be able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose it to risk of loss. In addition, it may not be possible to hedge fully or perfectly against currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in non - U.S. currencies because the value of those securities is likely to fluctuate as a result of factors not related to currency fluctuations.. We will be subject to corporate - level income tax if we are unable to qualify as a RIC under the Code.  No assurance can be given that we will be able to qualify for and maintain RIC status. To maintain RIC tax treatment under the Code, we must meet certain annual distribution, source of income and asset diversification requirements.. The annual distribution requirement for a RIC will be satisfied if we distribute to our stockholders on an annual basis at least 90% of our net ordinary income and realized net short - term capital gains in excess of realized net long - term capital losses, if any. Because we may use debt financing, we may be subject to asset coverage ratio requirements under the Investment Company Act and financial covenants under loan and credit agreements that could, under certain circumstances, restrict us from making distributions necessary to satisfy the distribution requirement. If we are unable to make the required distributions, we could fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate - level income tax.. The source of income requirement will be satisfied if we obtain at least 90% of our income for each year from dividends, interest, gains from the sale of stock or securities or similar sources.. The asset diversification requirement will be satisfied if we meet asset diversification requirements at the end of each quarter of our taxable year. We expect to satisfy the asset diversification requirements, but our business model calls for concentration in a relatively small number of portfolio companies. Failure to meet the asset diversification requirements could result in us having to dispose of investments quickly in order to prevent the loss of RIC status. Because most of our investments will be relatively illiquid, any such dispositions could be made at disadvantageous prices and could result in substantial losses. Further, the illiquidity of our investments may make them difficult or impossible to dispose of in a timely manner.. If we fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment for any reason and become subject to corporate income tax, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions and the value of your GECC shares.. The incentive fee structure and the formula for calculating the management fee may incentivize GECM to pursue speculative investments, advise us to use leverage when it may be unwise to do so, or advise us to refrain from reducing debt levels when it would otherwise be appropriate to do so.  The incentive fee payable by us to GECM creates an incentive for GECM to pursue investments on our behalf that are riskier or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such compensation arrangement. The incentive fee payable to GECM is calculated based on a percentage of our return on invested capital. In addition, GECM's base management fee is calculated on the basis of our gross assets, including assets acquired through the use of leverage. This may encourage GECM to use leverage to increase the aggregate amount of and the return on our investments, even when it may not be appropriate to do so, and to refrain from reducing debt levels when it would otherwise be appropriate to do so. The use of leverage increases our likelihood of default, which would impair the value of your shares. In addition, GECM will receive the incentive fee based, in part, upon net capital gains realized on our investments. Unlike that portion of the incentive fee based on income, there will be no hurdle rate applicable to the portion of the incentive fee based on net capital gains. As a result, GECM may have a tendency to invest more capital in investments that are likely to result in capital gains as compared to income producing securities. Such a practice could result in us investing in more speculative securities than would otherwise be the case, which could result in higher investment losses, particularly during economic downturns.. 36. We may invest in the securities and instruments of other investment companies, including private funds, and we will bear our ratable share of any such investment company's expenses, including management and performance fees. We will also remain obligated to pay management and incentive fees to GECM with respect to the assets invested in the securities and instruments of other investment companies. With respect to each of these investments, each of our stockholders will bear its share of the management and incentive fee payable to GECM as well as indirectly bearing the management and performance fees and other expenses of any investment companies in which we invest.. In addition, if we purchase our debt instruments and such purchase results in our recording a net gain on the extinguishment of debt for financial reporting and tax purposes, such net gain will be included in our pre - incentive fee net investment income for purposes of determining the income incentive fee payable to GECM under the Investment Management Agreement.. Finally, the incentive fee payable by us to GECM also may create an incentive for GECM to invest on our behalf in instruments that have a deferred interest feature such as investments with PIK provisions. Under these investments, we would accrue the interest over the life of the investment but would typically not receive the cash income from the investment until the end of the term or upon the investment being called by the issuer. Our net investment income used to calculate the income portion of our incentive fee, however, includes accrued interest. The portion of the incentive fee that is attributable to deferred interest, such as PIK, will not be paid to GECM until we receive such interest in cash. Even though such portion of the incentive fee will be paid only when the accrued income is collected, the accrued income is capitalized and included in the calculation of the base management fee. In other words, when deferred interest income (such as PIK) is accrued, a corresponding income incentive fee (if any) is also accrued (but not paid) based on that income. After the accrual of such income, it is capitalized and added to the debt balance, which increases our total assets and thus the base management fee it pays following such capitalization. If any such interest is reversed in connection with any write-off or similar treatment of the investment, we will reverse the income incentive fee accrual and an income incentive fee will not be payable with respect to such uncollected interest. If a portfolio company defaults on a loan, it is possible that accrued interest previously used in the calculation of whether GECM met the hurdle rate to earn incentive fee will become uncollectible.. A general increase in interest rates will likely have the effect of making it easier for GECM to receive incentive fees, without necessarily resulting in an increase in our net earnings.  Given the structure of the Investment Management Agreement, any general increase in interest rates, which are currently near historic lows, will likely have the effect of making it easier for GECM to meet the quarterly hurdle rate for payment of income incentive fees under the Investment Management Agreement without any additional increase in relative performance on the part of GECM. In addition, in view of the catch - up provision applicable to income incentive fees under the Investment Management Agreement, GECM could potentially receive a significant portion of the increase in our investment income attributable to such a general increase in interest rates. If that were to occur, our increase in net earnings, if any, would likely be significantly smaller than the relative increase in GECM's income incentive fee resulting from such a general increase in interest rates.. GECM has the right to resign on 60 days' notice, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations.  GECM has the right, under the Investment Management Agreement, to resign at any time upon not more than 60 days' written notice, whether we have found a replacement or not. If GECM resigns, we may not be able to find a new investment adviser or hire internal management with similar expertise and ability to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms within 60 days, or at all. If we are unable to do so quickly, our operations are likely to experience a disruption; our financial condition, business and results of operations as well as our ability to pay distributions are likely to be adversely affected; and the market price of our shares may decline. In addition, the coordination of our internal management and investment activities is likely to suffer if we are unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by our investment adviser and its affiliates. Even if we are able to retain comparable management, whether internal or external, the integration of such management and their lack of familiarity with our investment objective and current investment portfolio may result in additional costs and time delays that may adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations and cause you to lose your investment.. 37. We incur significant costs as a result of being a publicly traded company.  As a publicly traded company, we incur legal, accounting and other expenses, including costs associated with the periodic reporting requirements applicable to a company whose securities are registered under Exchange Act, as well as additional corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes - Oxley Act\"), the Dodd - Frank Act and other rules implemented by our government.. Changes in laws or regulations governing our operations may adversely affect our business or cause us to alter our business strategy.  We and our portfolio companies are subject to applicable local, state and federal laws and regulations. New legislation may be enacted or new interpretations, rulings or regulations could be adopted, including those governing the types of investments we are permitted to make, any of which could harm us and you, potentially with retroactive effect. Additionally, any changes to the laws and regulations governing our operations relating to permitted investments may cause us to alter our investment strategy in order to avail our self of new or different opportunities. Such changes could result in material differences to the strategies and plans and may result in our investment focus shifting from the areas of expertise of GECM to other types of investments in which the investment committee may have less expertise or little or no experience. Specifically, tax reform legislation could have an adverse impact on us, the credit markets and our portfolio companies, notwithstanding the reduction in corporate tax rates.  Thus, any such changes, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment in us.. Pending legislation may allow us to incur additional debt.  As a BDC, under the Investment Company Act generally we are not permitted to incur indebtedness unless immediately after such borrowing we have an asset coverage for total borrowings of at least 200% (i.e., the amount of debt may not exceed 50% of the value of our total assets or we may borrow an amount equal to 100% of net assets). Legislation passed in the U.S. House of Representatives, if it becomes law, would increase the amount of debt that BDCs may incur by modifying the asset coverage percentage from 200% to 150%. As a result, we may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future and therefore your risk of an investment in us may increase.. There is, and will be, uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments.  Under the Investment Company Act, we are required to carry our portfolio investments at market value or, if there is no readily available market value, at fair value as determined by us in accordance with our written valuation policy, with our Board having final responsibility for overseeing, reviewing and approving, in good faith, our estimate of fair value. Often, there will not be a public market for the securities of the privately held companies in which we invest. As a result, we will value these securities quarterly at fair value based on input from management, third party independent valuation firms and our audit committee, with the oversight, review and approval of our Board.. The determination of fair value and consequently, the amount of unrealized gains and losses in our portfolio, are subjective and dependent on a valuation process approved and overseen by our Board. Factors that may be considered in determining the fair value of our investments include, among others, estimates of the collectability of the principal and interest on our debt investments and expected realization on our equity investments, as well as external events, such as private mergers, sales and acquisitions involving comparable companies. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private securities and private companies and small cap public companies, are inherently uncertain, they may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates. Our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed. Due to this uncertainty, our fair value determinations may cause our net asset value on a given date to materially misstate the value that we may ultimately realize on one or more of our investments. As a result, investors purchasing our securities based on an overstated net asset value would pay a higher price than the value of our investments might warrant. Conversely, investors selling securities during a period in which the net asset value understates the value of our investments will receive a lower price for their securities than the value of our investments might otherwise warrant.. Our financial condition and results of operations depend on our ability to effectively manage and deploy capital.  Our ability to achieve our investment objective depends on our ability to effectively manage and deploy capital, which depends, in turn, on GECM's ability to identify, evaluate and monitor, and our ability to finance and invest in, companies that meet our investment criteria.. 38. Accomplishing our investment objective on a cost - effective basis is largely a function of GECM's handling of the investment process, its ability to provide competent, attentive and efficient services and its access to investments offering acceptable terms. In addition to monitoring the performance of our existing investments, GECM may also be called upon, from time to time, to provide managerial assistance to some of our portfolio companies. These demands on their time may distract them or slow the rate of investment.. Even if we are able to grow and build out our investment operations, any failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our results of operations will depend on many factors, including the availability of opportunities for investment, readily accessible short and long - term funding alternatives in the financial markets and economic conditions.. We may hold assets in cash or short-term treasury securities in situations where we or GECM expects downward pricing in the high yield market. Our strategic decision not to be fully invested may, from time to time, reduce funds available for distribution and cause downward pressure on the price of our common stock.. The failure in cyber security systems, as well as the occurrence of events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems and management continuity planning, could impair our ability to conduct business effectively.  The occurrence of a disaster such as a cyber - attack, a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a terrorist attack or war, events anticipated or unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems, or a failure in externally provided data systems, could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if those events affect our computer - based data processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval systems or destroy data. Our ability to effectively conduct our business could be severely compromised. The financial markets we operate in are dependent upon third party data systems to link buyers and sellers and provide pricing information.. We depend heavily upon computer systems to perform necessary business functions. Our computer systems could be subject to cyber - attacks and unauthorized access, such as physical and electronic break - ins or unauthorized tampering. Like other companies, we will experience threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, system failures and disruptions. If one or more of these events occurs, it could potentially jeopardize the confidential, proprietary and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, which could result in damage to our reputation, financial losses, litigation, increased costs, regulatory penalties and/or customer dissatisfaction or loss, respectively.. Terrorist attacks, acts of war or natural disasters may affect the market for our common stock, impact the businesses in which we invest and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.  Terrorist acts, acts of war or natural disasters may disrupt our operations, as well as the operations of the businesses in which we invest. Such acts have created, and continue to create, economic and political uncertainties and have contributed to global economic instability. Future terrorist activities, military or security operations, or natural disasters could further weaken the domestic/global economies and create additional uncertainties, which may negatively impact the businesses in which we invest directly or indirectly and, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Losses from terrorist attacks and natural disasters are generally uninsurable.. Provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law and our organizational documents could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the prices of our common stock.  The Maryland General Corporation Law and our organizational documents contain provisions that may discourage, delay or make more difficult a change in control of GECC or the removal of our directors. We are subject to the Maryland Business Combination Act and the Investment Company Act. If our Board does not approve a business combination, the Maryland Business Combination Act may discourage third parties from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer. Our Board could amend our bylaws to repeal our current exemption from the Control Share Acquisition Act; however, our Board will not amend our bylaws to repeal the current exemption from the Control Share Acquisition Act without a formal determination by the Board that doing so would be in the best interests of our stockholders and without first notifying the SEC staff.  The Control Share Acquisition Act also may make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of GECC and increase the difficulty of consummating such a transaction.. 39. Our Board is authorized to reclassify any unissued shares of common stock into one or more classes of preferred stock, which could convey special rights and privileges to its owners.  Under Maryland General Corporation Law and our organizational documents, our Board is authorized to classify and reclassify any authorized but unissued shares of stock into one or more classes of stock, including preferred stock. Prior to issuance of shares of each class or series, our Board will be required by Maryland law and our charter to set the terms, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption for each class or series. Thus, our Board could authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock with terms and conditions which could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve premium prices for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in their best interest. The cost of any such reclassification would be borne by our common stockholders. Certain matters under the Investment Company Act require the separate vote of the holders of any issued and outstanding preferred stock. For example, holders of preferred stock would vote as a separate class from the holders of common stock on a proposal to cease operations as a BDC. In addition, the Investment Company Act provides that holders of preferred stock are entitled to vote separately from holders of common stock to elect two preferred stock directors. The issuance of preferred shares convertible into shares of common stock may also reduce the net income and net asset value per share of our common stock upon conversion. These effects, among others, could have an adverse effect on your investment in our common stock.. GECM may not be able to achieve the same or similar returns as those achieved by MAST Capital, . including as a result of operating under the constraints imposed upon us as a BDC  MAST Capital's track record and achievements are not necessarily indicative of future results that will be achieved by GECM. We cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve the results realized by prior investment vehicles managed by MAST Capital.. While senior members of GECM's investment team have significant experience investing in debt securities of middle - market companies, GECM is a new entity and has no investment advisory experience, including no experience managing a BDC. Therefore, GECM may not be able to successfully operate our business or achieve our investment objective. As a result, an investment in our shares entails more risk than the shares of a comparable company with a substantial operating history.. GECM's lack of experience in managing a portfolio of assets under RIC, BDC and Investment Company Act constraints may hinder our ability to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and, as a result, achieve our investment objective.. The Investment Company Act and the Code impose numerous constraints on the operations of registered investment companies, BDCs and RICs that do not apply to the other types of investment vehicles. Moreover, qualification for RIC tax treatment requires satisfaction of certain source-of-income, distribution and asset diversification requirements. The failure to comply with these provisions in a timely manner could prevent us from qualifying as a RIC or could force us to pay unexpected taxes and penalties, which could be material. GECM's lack of experience in managing a portfolio of assets under such constraints may hinder our ability to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and, as a result, achieve our investment objective.. We are a new company with limited operating history and GECM has no prior experience managing a BDC.  We were formed on April 22, 2016 and commenced operations following the closing of the Merger on November 3, 2016. As a BDC, we are subject to the regulatory requirements of the SEC, in addition to the specific regulatory requirements applicable to BDCs under the Investment Company Act and RICs under the Code. GECM has not had any prior experience operating under this regulatory framework, and we may incur substantial additional costs, and expend significant time or other resources, to do so.. We have a limited operating history on which you can evaluate an investment in us or our prior performance. The results of any other funds or clients managed by affiliates of GECM, which have or have had an investment program that is similar to, or different from, our investment program is not indicative of the results that we may achieve. We expect to have a different investment portfolio and may employ different investment strategies and techniques from other funds and clients advised by affiliates of GECM. Accordingly, our results may differ from and are independent of the results obtained by such other funds and clients. Moreover, past performance is no assurance of future returns. We are subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business, including the risk that we will not achieve our investment objective and that the value of our common stock could decline substantially or your investment in us could become worthless.. 40. We cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our securities less attractive to investors.  We are and will remain an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the JOBS Act until the earlier of (a) the last day of the fiscal year (i) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Merger, (ii) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (iii) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of its common stock that is held by non - affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the end of the previous second fiscal quarter, and (b) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non - convertible debt during the prior three - year period. For so long as we remain an \"emerging growth company\" we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \"emerging growth companies\" including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act. We cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on some or all of these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active and more volatile trading market for our securities.. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \"emerging growth company\" may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \"emerging growth company\" can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. To the extent we take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, it will be more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate us since our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates and may result in less investor confidence.. There are significant potential conflicts of interest that could impact our investment returns.  Certain of our executive officers and directors, and members of the investment committee of GECM, serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of other entities and affiliates of GECM and investment funds managed by our affiliates. Accordingly, they may have obligations to investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which might not be in our or our stockholders' best interests or that may require them to devote time to services for other entities, which could interfere with the time available to provide services to us. For example, Peter A. Reed, our president, chief executive officer and chairman of our Board, is GECM's chief investment officer and chief executive officer of the second largest beneficial owner of our stock, GEC.. Although funds managed by GECM may have different primary investment objectives than we do, they may from time to time invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. GECM is not restricted from raising an investment fund with investment objectives similar to ours. Any such funds may also, from time to time, invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. It is possible that we may not be given the opportunity to participate in certain investments made by investment funds managed by investment managers affiliated with GECM.. We will pay management and incentive fees to GECM, and will reimburse GECM for certain expenses it incurs. In addition, investors in our common stock will invest on a gross basis and receive distributions on a net basis after expenses, resulting in, among other things, a lower rate of return than one might achieve through direct investments.. GECM's management fee is based on a percentage of our total assets (other than cash or cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds) and GECM may have conflicts of interest in connection with decisions that could affect our total assets, such as decisions as to whether to incur indebtedness.. The part of the incentive fee payable by us that relates to our pre-incentive fee net investment income is computed and paid on income that may include interest that is accrued but not yet received in cash. If a portfolio company defaults on a loan or note that is structured to provide accrued interest, it is possible that accrued interest previously used in the calculation of the incentive fee will become uncollectible.. The Investment Management Agreement renews for successive annual periods if approved by our Board or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons. However, both we and GECM have the right to terminate the agreement without penalty upon 60 days' written notice to the other party. Moreover, conflicts of interest may arise if GECM seeks to change the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, including, for example, the terms for compensation.. 41. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, we pay GECM our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by GECM in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs.. As a result of the arrangements described above, there may be times when our management team has interests that differ from those of our stockholders, giving rise to a conflict.. Our stockholders may have conflicting investment, tax and other objectives with respect to their investments in us. The conflicting interests of individual stockholders may relate to or arise from, among other things, the nature of our investments, the structure or the acquisition of our investments, and the timing of disposition of our investments. As a consequence, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with decisions made by GECM, including with respect to the nature or structuring of our investments, that may be more beneficial for one stockholder than for another stockholder, especially with respect to stockholders' individual tax situations. In selecting and structuring investments appropriate for us, GECM will consider the investment and tax objectives of us and our stockholders, as a whole, not the investment, tax or other objectives of any stockholder individually.. Potential Changes in Law or Regulation.  In December 2015, the SEC proposed a new rule to regulate the use of derivatives by registered investment companies, including us. If the rule goes into effect, it could limit our ability to invest or remain invested in derivatives. In addition, other future regulatory developments may impact our ability to invest or remain invested in derivatives. Legislation or regulation may also change the way in which we are regulated. We cannot predict the effects of any new governmental regulation that may be implemented on our ability to use swaps or any other financial derivative product, and there can be no assurance that any new governmental regulation will not adversely affect our ability to achieve our investment objective.. Shares of closed-end investment companies, including business development companies, frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value. Shares of closed-end investment companies, including business development companies, frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value. This characteristic of closed-end investment companies is separate and distinct from the risk that our net asset value per share of common stock may decline.. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value per share of our common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in the best interests of GECC and our stockholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price that, in the determination of our board of directors, equals the fair value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount calculated). If we raise additional funds by issuing more common stock or senior securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common stock, then your percentage ownership at that time will decrease, and you may experience dilution.. You may not receive distributions or our distributions may not grow over time and a portion of our distributions may be a return of capital. We intend to make distributions on a monthly basis to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution (i.e., not subject to any legal restrictions under Maryland law on the distribution thereof). We cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. Our ability to pay distributions might be adversely affected by the impact of one or more of the risk factors described in this document. Due to the asset coverage test applicable to us under the Investment Company Act as a BDC, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions.. When we make distributions, we will be required to determine the extent to which such distributions are paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of an investor's basis in our stock and, assuming that an investor holds our stock as a capital asset, thereafter as a capital gain. Stockholders who periodically receive the payment of a distribution consisting of a return of capital may be under the impression that they are receiving net profits when they are not. Stockholders should not assume that the source of a distribution from us is net profit.. 42. We currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long term capital gains in excess of short term capital losses), if any, at least annually, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment and elect to treat such gains as deemed distributions to you. If this happens, you will be treated as if you had received an actual distribution of the capital gains we retain and reinvested the net after tax proceeds in GECC. In this situation, you would be eligible to claim a tax credit (or, in certain circumstances, a tax refund) equal to your allocable share of the tax we paid on the capital gains deemed distributed to you.. Our current intention is to make any distributions in additional shares of our common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan out of assets legally available therefor, unless you elect to receive your distributions and/or long-term capital gains distributions in cash. If you hold shares in the name of a broker or financial intermediary, you should contact the broker or financial intermediary regarding your election to receive distributions in cash.. We can offer no assurance that we will achieve results that will permit the payment of any cash distributions and, if we issue senior securities, we will be prohibited from making distributions if doing so causes us to fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios stipulated by the Investment Company Act or if distributions are limited by the terms of any of our borrowings.. Stockholders may experience dilution in their ownership percentage if they do not participate in our dividend reinvestment plan. All distributions declared in cash payable to stockholders that are participants in our dividend reinvestment plan are generally automatically reinvested in shares of our common stock. As a result, stockholders that do not participate in the dividend reinvestment plan may experience dilution over time. Stockholders who receive distributions in shares of common stock may experience accretion to the net asset value of their shares if our shares are trading at a premium and dilution if our shares are trading at a discount. The level of accretion or discount would depend on various factors, including the proportion of our stockholders who participate in the plan, the level of premium or discount at which our shares are trading and the amount of the distribution payable to a stockholder.. Existing stockholders may incur dilution if, in the future, we sell shares of our common stock in one or more offerings at prices below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock. The Investment Company Act prohibits us from selling shares of our common stock at a price below the current net asset value per share of such stock, with certain exceptions. Our shares might trade at premiums that are unsustainable or at discounts from net asset value.. Shares of business development companies like us may, during some periods, trade at prices higher than their net asset value per share and, during other periods, as frequently occurs with closed-end investment companies, trade at prices lower than their net asset value per share. The perceived value of our investment portfolio may be affected by a number of factors including perceived prospects for individual companies we invest in, market conditions for common stock generally, for initial public offerings and other exit events for venture capital backed companies, and the mix of companies in our investment portfolio over time. Negative or unforeseen developments affecting the perceived value of companies in our investment portfolio could result in a decline in the trading price of our common stock relative to our net asset value per share.. The possibility that our shares will trade at a discount from net asset value or at premiums that are unsustainable are risks separate and distinct from the risk that our net asset value per share will decrease. The risk of purchasing shares of a BDC that might trade at a discount or unsustainable premium is more pronounced for investors who wish to sell their shares in a relatively short period of time because, for those investors, realization of a gain or loss on their investments is likely to be more dependent upon changes in premium or discount levels than upon increases or decreases in net asset value per share.. 43. Future offerings of debt securities, which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation, or equity securities, which could dilute our existing stockholders and may be senior to our common stock for the purposes of distributions, may harm the value of our common stock. In the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making offerings of debt or equity securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes and classes of preferred stock or common stock, subject to the restrictions of the Investment Company Act. Upon a liquidation of our company, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings by us may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the value of our common stock, or both. Any preferred stock we may issue would have a preference on distributions that could limit our ability to make distributions to the holders of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their stock holdings in us. In addition, proceeds from a sale of common stock will likely be used to increase our total assets or to pay down our borrowings, among other uses. This would increase our asset coverage ratio and permit us to incur additional leverage under rules pertaining to business development companies by increasing our borrowings or issuing senior securities such as preferred stock or additional debt securities."
