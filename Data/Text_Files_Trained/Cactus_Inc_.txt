[1] "Item 1A.   Risk Factors. Investing in our Class A Common Stock involves risks. You should carefully consider the information in this Annual Report, including the matters addressed under \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward - Looking Statements,\" and the following risks before making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks or uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we deem immaterial, may also have an effect on our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations. The trading price of our Class A Common Stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.. Risks Related to the Oilfield Services Industry and Our Business. Demand for our products and services depends on oil and gas industry activity and expenditure levels, which are directly affected by trends in the demand for and price of crude oil and natural gas.. Demand for our products and services depends primarily upon the general level of activity in the oil and gas industry, including the number of drilling rigs in operation, the number of oil and gas wells being drilled, the depth and drilling conditions of these wells, the volume of production, the number of well completions and the level of well remediation activity, and the corresponding capital spending by oil and natural gas companies. Oil and gas activity is in turn heavily influenced by, among other factors, oil and gas prices worldwide, which have historically been volatile.. Declines, as well as anticipated declines, in oil and gas prices could negatively affect the level of these activities and capital spending, which could adversely affect demand for our products and services and, in certain instances, result in the cancellation, modification or rescheduling of existing and expected orders and the ability of our customers to pay us for our products and services. These factors could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.. 12. Table of Contents. Factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include, but are not limited to, the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdemand for hydrocarbons, which is affected by worldwide population growth, economic growth rates and general economic and business conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in sentiment on environmental matters;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcosts of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical and economic uncertainty and sociopolitical unrest;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tavailable excess production capacity within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\"OPEC\") and the level of oil and gas production by non - OPEC countries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toil refining capacity and shifts in end - customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttechnological advances affecting energy consumption;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential acceleration of the development of alternative fuels;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\taccess to capital and credit markets, which may affect our customers' activity levels and spending for our products and services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe relative strength of the U.S. dollar;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in laws and regulations related to hydraulic fracturing activities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in environmental laws and regulations (including relating to the use of coal in power plants); and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnatural disasters.. The oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge. The last downturn in the oil and gas industry that began in mid - 2014 resulted in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and adversely affected our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any future downturn or expected downturn could again adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. The cyclicality of the oil and natural gas industry may cause our operating results to fluctuate.. We derive our revenues from companies in the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry, a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and natural gas prices. We have experienced and may in the future experience significant fluctuations in operating results as a result of the reactions of our customers to changes in oil and natural gas prices. For example, prolonged low commodity prices during 2015 and 2016, combined with adverse changes in the capital and credit markets, caused many exploration and production companies to reduce their capital budgets and drilling activity. This resulted in a significant decline in demand for oilfield services and adversely impacted the prices we could charge, particularly for rentals of frac equipment.. 13. Table of Contents. If oil prices or natural gas prices decline, the demand for our products and services could be adversely affected.. The demand for our products and services is primarily determined by current and anticipated oil and natural gas prices and the level of drilling activity and related general production spending in the areas in which we have operations. Volatility or weakness in oil prices or natural gas prices (or the perception that oil prices or natural gas prices will decrease) affects the spending patterns of our customers and may result in the drilling of fewer new wells or lower production spending on existing wells. When this occurs, exploration and production (\"E&P\") companies move to significantly cut costs, both by decreasing drilling and completions activity and by demanding price concessions from their service providers. This results in lower demand for our products and services and may cause lower rates and lower utilization of our equipment. If oil prices decline or natural gas prices continue to remain low or decline further, or if there is a reduction in drilling activities, the demand for our products and services and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.. Additionally, the commercial development of economically viable alternative energy sources (such as wind, solar, geothermal, tidal, fuel cells and biofuels) could reduce demand for our products and services and create downward pressure on the revenue we are able to derive from such products and services, as they are dependent on oil and natural gas prices.. Anticipated growth in U.S. drilling and completions activity, and our ability to benefit from such anticipated growth, could be adversely affected by any significant constraints in pressure pumping capacity in the industry.. Growth in U.S. drilling and completions activity may be impacted by, among other things, pressure pumping capacity and pricing, which, in turn, is impacted by, among other things, the availability of fracturing equipment, demand for fracturing equipment and fracturing intensity per active rig. Also, longer laterals and higher intensity fracturing result in greater wear and tear to the industry's fracturing equipment, which has caused and will continue to cause attrition in the supply of fracturing equipment and shortages in the availability of pressure pumping services. In addition, rising fracturing intensity per rig and an overall increase in completions activity has increased the demand for fracturing equipment. During the completion phase of a well, we rent frac stacks, zipper manifolds and other high - pressure equipment used during the hydraulic fracturing process. For the subsequent production phase of a well, we sell production trees, which are installed on the wellhead after the frac tree has been removed. Any significant additional constraints in the availability of pressure pumping services, fracturing equipment or the ability of fracturing service providers to deliver fracturing services would have an adverse impact on the demand for the products we sell and rent, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. We design, manufacture, sell, rent and install equipment that is used in oil and gas exploration and production activities, which may subject us to liability, including claims for personal injury, property damage and environmental contamination should such equipment fail to perform to specifications.. We provide products and systems to customers involved in oil and gas exploration, development and production. Some of our equipment is designed to operate in high - temperature and/or high - pressure environments, and some equipment is designed for use in hydraulic fracturing operations. We also provide parts, repair services and field services associated with installation at all of our facilities and service centers in the United States and at our facility in Australia, as well as at customer sites. Because of applications to which our products and services are exposed, particularly those involving high pressure environments, a failure of such equipment, or a failure of our customer to maintain or operate the equipment properly, could cause damage to the equipment, damage to the property of customers and others, personal injury and environmental contamination and could lead to a variety of claims against us that could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. We indemnify our customers against certain claims and liabilities resulting or arising from our provision of goods or services to them. In addition, we rely on customer indemnifications, generally, and third - party insurance as part. 14. Table of Contents. of our risk mitigation strategy. However, our insurance may not be adequate to cover our liabilities. In addition, our customers may be unable to satisfy indemnification claims against them. Further, insurance companies may refuse to honor their policies, or insurance may not generally be available in the future, or if available, premiums may not be commercially justifiable. We could incur substantial liabilities and damages that are either not covered by insurance or that are in excess of policy limits, or incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance. Such potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. We may be unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled and qualified workers to sustain or expand our current operations.. The delivery of our products and services requires personnel with specialized skills and experience. Our ability to be productive and profitable will depend upon our ability to attract and retain skilled workers. In addition, our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase the size of our skilled labor force. The demand for skilled workers is high, the supply is limited, and the cost to attract and retain qualified personnel has increased. During industry downturns, skilled workers may leave the industry, reducing the availability of qualified workers when conditions improve. In addition, a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in increases in the wage rates that we must pay. If we are not able to employ and retain skilled workers, our ability to respond quickly to customer demands or strong market conditions may inhibit our growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Political, regulatory, economic and social disruptions in the countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect our business or results of operations.. In addition to our facilities in the United States, we operate one production facility in China and have a facility in Australia that sells and rents equipment as well as provides parts, repair services and field services associated with installation. Instability and unforeseen changes in any of the markets in which we conduct business could have an adverse effect on the demand for, or supply of, our products and services, our results of operations and our financial condition. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnationalization and expropriation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotentially burdensome taxation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinflationary and recessionary markets, including capital and equity markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcivil unrest, labor issues, political instability, terrorist attacks, cyber - terrorism, military activity and wars;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsupply disruptions in key oil producing countries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttariffs, trade restrictions, trade protection measures associated with Section 232 or price controls;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforeign ownership restrictions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timport or export licensing requirements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions on operations, trade practices, trade partners and investment decisions resulting from domestic and foreign laws and regulations;. 15. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in, and the administration of, laws and regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinability to repatriate income or capital;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treductions in the availability of qualified personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforeign currency fluctuations or currency restrictions; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in the interest rate component of forward foreign currency rates.. We are dependent on a relatively small number of customers in a single industry. The loss of an important customer could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.. Our customers are engaged in the oil and natural gas E&P business primarily in the United States and Australia. Historically, we have been dependent on a relatively small number of customers for our revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Pioneer Natural Resources represented 11% of our total revenue, and no other customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue. For each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, Devon Energy Corporation represented 12% of our total revenue, and no other customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue.. Our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if an important customer ceases to engage us for our services on favorable terms or at all or fails to pay or delays in paying us significant amounts of our outstanding receivables.. Additionally, the E&P industry is characterized by frequent consolidation activity. Changes in ownership of our customers may result in the loss of, or reduction in, business from those customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Customer credit risks could result in losses.. The concentration of our customers in the energy industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions. In addition, laws in some jurisdictions outside of the U.S. in which we operate could make collection difficult or time consuming. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and do not generally require collateral in support of our trade receivables. While we maintain reserves for potential credit losses, we cannot assure such reserves will be sufficient to meet write - offs of uncollectible receivables or that our losses from such receivables will be consistent with our expectations.. To the extent one or more of our key customers commences bankruptcy proceedings, our contracts with these customers may be subject to rejection under applicable provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code, or may be renegotiated. Further, during any such bankruptcy proceeding, prior to assumption, rejection or renegotiation of such contracts, the bankruptcy court may temporarily authorize the payment of value for our services less than contractually required, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. Delays in obtaining, or inability to obtain or renew, permits or authorizations by our customers for their operations could impair our business.. In most states, our customers are required to obtain permits or authorizations from one or more governmental agencies or other third parties to perform drilling and completions activities, including hydraulic fracturing. Such permits or approvals are typically required by state agencies but can also be required by federal and local governmental agencies. 16. Table of Contents. or other third parties. The requirements for such permits or authorizations vary depending on the location where such drilling and completions activities will be conducted. As with most permitting and authorization processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit or approval to be issued and the conditions which may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. In some jurisdictions, such as New York State and within the jurisdiction of the Delaware River Basin Commission, certain regulatory authorities have delayed or suspended the issuance of permits or authorizations while the potential environmental impacts associated with issuing such permits can be studied and appropriate mitigation measures evaluated. In Texas, rural water districts have begun to impose restrictions on water use and may require permits for water used in drilling and completions activities. Permitting, authorization or renewal delays, the inability to obtain new permits or the revocation of current permits could cause a loss of revenue and potentially have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. We may lose money on fixed - price contracts.. From time to time, we agree to provide products and services under relatively short term fixed - price contracts. Under these contracts, we are typically responsible for cost overruns. Our actual costs and any gross profit realized on these fixed - price contracts may vary from the estimated amounts on which these contracts were originally based. There is inherent risk in the estimation process, including significant unforeseen technical and logistical challenges or longer than expected deployment times in the case of rentals. Depending on the size of a project, variations from estimated contract performance could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. Increased costs, or lack of availability, of raw materials and other components may result in increased operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.. Our ability to source low cost raw materials and components, such as steel castings and forgings, is critical to our ability to manufacture and sell our products and provide our services competitively. Our results of operations may be adversely affected by our inability to manage the rising costs and availability of raw materials and components used in our wide variety of products and systems. We cannot assure that we will be able to continue to purchase these raw materials on a timely basis or at commercially viable prices, nor can we be certain of the impact of Section 232. Further, unexpected changes in the size of regional and/or product markets, particularly for short lead - time products, could affect our results of operations and cash flows. Should our current suppliers be unable to provide the necessary raw materials or components or otherwise fail to deliver such materials and components timely and in the quantities required, resulting delays in the provision of products or services to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.. In accordance with Section 1502 of the Dodd - Frank Act, the SEC's rules regarding mandatory disclosure and reporting requirements by public companies of their use of \"conflict minerals\" (tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold) originating in the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries became effective in 2014. While the conflict minerals rule continues in effect as adopted, there remains uncertainty regarding how the conflict minerals rule, and our compliance obligations, will be affected in the future. Additional requirements under the rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain of the conflict minerals used in the manufacture of our products or in the provision of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to purchase these products in the future. The costs of compliance, including those related to supply chain research, the limited number of suppliers and possible changes in the sourcing of these minerals, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.. Competition within the oilfield services industry may adversely affect our ability to market our services.. The oilfield services industry is highly competitive and fragmented and includes numerous small companies capable of competing effectively in our markets on a local basis, as well as several large companies that possess substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. The amount of equipment available may exceed demand,. 17. Table of Contents. which could result in active price competition. Many contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which may further increase competition based primarily on price. In addition, adverse market conditions lower demand for well servicing equipment, which results in excess equipment and lower utilization rates. If market conditions in our oil - oriented operating areas were to deteriorate or if adverse market conditions in our natural gas - oriented operating areas persist, utilization rates may decline. The competitive environment has intensified since late 2014 as a result of the industry downturn and oversupply of oilfield equipment and services. Any significant future increase in overall market capacity for the products, rental equipment or services that we offer could adversely affect our business and results of operations.. Our relationship with one of our vendors is important to us.. We obtain certain important materials and machining services from one of our vendors located in China. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately $33.4 million, $10.8 million and $18.1 million of purchases of machined components were made from this vendor, representing approximately 22%, 20% and 27%, respectively, of our total third party vendor purchases of raw materials, finished products, equipment, machining and other services. If we are not able to maintain our relationship with such vendor, our results of operations could be adversely impacted until we are able to find an alternative vendor.. Conservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas and our services.. Fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas, resulting in reduced demand for oilfield services. The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. Indebtedness and liquidity needs could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.. Indebtedness we may incur in the future, whether incurred in connection with acquisitions, operations or otherwise, may adversely affect our operations and limit our growth, and we may have difficulty making debt service payments on such indebtedness as payments become due. Our level of indebtedness may affect our operations in several ways, including the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions should our business fail to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt obligations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimiting our ability to borrow funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments due to the covenants that are contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\taffecting our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcausing an event of default resulting from any failure to comply with the financial or other covenants of our debt, including covenants that impose requirements to maintain certain financial ratios; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timpairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes.. 18. Table of Contents. We are subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk.. We outsource certain of our wellhead equipment to suppliers in China, and our production facility in China assembles and tests these outsourced components, as we do not engage in machining operations in this facility. In addition, we have a service center in Australia that sells products, rents frac equipment and provides field services. To the extent either facility has net U.S. dollar denominated assets, our profitability is eroded when the U.S. dollar weakens against the Chinese Yuan and the Australian dollar. Our production facility in China generally has net U.S. dollar denominated assets, while our service center in Australia generally has net U.S. dollar denominated liabilities. The U.S. dollar translated profits and net assets of our facilities in China and Australia are eroded if the respective local currency value weakens against the U.S. dollar. We have not entered into any derivative arrangements to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates.. New technology may cause us to become less competitive.. The oilfield services industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling and completions techniques and services using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent or other intellectual property protections. Although we believe our equipment and processes currently give us a competitive advantage, as competitors and others use or develop new or comparable technologies in the future, we may lose market share or be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Further, we may face competitive pressure to develop, implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that may allow them to enjoy various competitive advantages in the development and implementation of new technologies. We cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to develop and implement new technologies or products. Limits on our ability to develop, effectively use and implement new and emerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, including the reduction in the value of assets replaced by new technologies.. A failure of our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact us.. We depend on our information technology (\"IT\") systems for the efficient operation of our business. Accordingly, we rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our IT hardware and software infrastructure and our ability to expand and update this infrastructure in response to our changing needs. Despite our implementation of security measures, our systems are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, incursions by intruders or hackers, failures in hardware or software, power fluctuations, cyber terrorists and other similar disruptions. Additionally, we rely on third parties to support the operation of our IT hardware and software infrastructure, and in certain instances, utilize web - based applications. Although no such material incidents have occurred to date, the failure of our IT systems or those of our vendors to perform as anticipated for any reason or any significant breach of security could disrupt our business and result in numerous adverse consequences, including reduced effectiveness and efficiency of operations, inappropriate disclosure of confidential and proprietary information, reputational harm, increased overhead costs and loss of important information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.. Our business is dependent on the continuing services of certain of our key managers and employees.. We depend on key personnel. The loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business if we are unable to implement certain strategies or transactions in their absence. The loss of qualified employees or an inability to retain and motivate additional highly - skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to successfully maintain and expand our market share.. 19. Table of Contents. Equity interests in us are a substantial portion of the net worth of our executive officers and several of our other senior managers. Following the completion of the IPO, those executive officers and other senior managers have increased liquidity with respect to their equity interests in us. As a result, those executive officers and senior managers may have less incentive to remain employed by us. After terminating their employment with us, some of them may become employed by our competitors.. Adverse weather conditions could impact demand for our services or materially impact our costs.. Our business could be materially adversely affected by adverse weather conditions. For example, unusually warm winters could adversely affect the demand for our products and services by decreasing the demand for natural gas or unusually cold winters could adversely affect our ability to perform our services due to delays in the delivery of products that we need to provide our services. Our operations in arid regions can be affected by droughts and limited access to water used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Adverse weather can also directly impede our own operations. Repercussions of adverse weather conditions may include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcurtailment of services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tweather - related damage to infrastructure, transportation, facilities and equipment, resulting in delays in operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinability to deliver equipment, personnel and products to job sites in accordance with contract schedules; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of productivity.. Competition among oilfield service and equipment providers is affected by each provider's reputation for safety and quality.. Our activities are subject to a wide range of national, state and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, customers maintain their own compliance and reporting requirements. Failure to comply with these health and safety laws and regulations, or failure to comply with our customers' compliance or reporting requirements, could tarnish our reputation for safety and quality and have a material adverse effect on our competitive position.. Our operations require us to comply with various domestic and international regulations, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. We are exposed to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to matters such as environmental, workplace, health and safety, labor and employment, customs and tariffs, export and reexport controls, economic sanctions, currency exchange, bribery and corruption and taxation. These laws and regulations are complex, frequently change and have tended to become more stringent over time. They may be adopted, enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in such a manner that the incremental cost of compliance could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. Our operations outside of the United States require us to comply with numerous anti - bribery and anti - corruption regulations. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), among others, applies to us and our operations. Our policies, procedures and programs may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents, and severe criminal or civil sanctions may be imposed as a result of violations of these laws. We are also subject to the risks that our employees and agents outside of the United States may fail to comply with applicable laws.. 20. Table of Contents. In addition, we import raw materials, semi - finished goods, and finished products into the United States, China and Australia for use in such countries or for manufacturing and/or finishing for re - export and import into another country for use or further integration into equipment or systems. Most movement of raw materials, semi - finished or finished products involves imports and exports. As a result, compliance with multiple trade sanctions, embargoes and import/export laws and regulations pose a constant challenge and risk to us since a portion of our business is conducted outside of the United States through our subsidiaries. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could materially affect our reputation, results of operations and financial condition.. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations.. Environmental laws and regulations in the United States and foreign countries affect the equipment, systems and services we design, market and sell, as well as the facilities where we manufacture and produce our equipment and systems in the United States and China, and opportunities our customers pursue that create demand for our products. For example, we may be affected by such laws as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\"), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"), the Clean Water Act, and the Occupational Safety and Health Act (\"OSHA\") of 1970. Further, our customers may be subject to a range of laws and regulations governing hydraulic fracturing, offshore drilling, and greenhouse gas emissions.. We are required to invest financial and managerial resources to comply with environmental laws and regulations and believe that we will continue to be required to do so in the future. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, or the issuance of orders enjoining operations. These laws and regulations, as well as the adoption of other new laws and regulations affecting exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas by our customers, could adversely affect our business and operating results by increasing our costs, limiting the demand for our products and services or restricting our operations. Increased regulation or a move away from the use of fossil fuels caused by additional regulation could also reduce demand for our products and services. For additional information, please see \"Item 1. Business - Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation.\" The operations of the energy industry, including those undertaking hydraulic fracturing, are also subject to wildlife - protection laws and regulations, such as the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (\"MBTA\") or the Endangered Species Act, which may impact exploration, development, and production activities through regulations intended to protect certain species. For example, regulations under the MBTA sometimes require companies to cover reserve pits that are open for more than 90 days to prevent the taking of birds.. Concerns over general economic, business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.. Concerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of credit and the European, Asian and the United States financial markets have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. These factors, combined with volatility in commodity prices, business and consumer confidence and unemployment rates, have precipitated an economic slowdown. Concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad deteriorates, worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish further, which could impact the price at which oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids can be sold, which could affect the ability of our customers to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.. 21. Table of Contents. Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, which could expose us to substantial liability and cause us to lose customers and substantial revenue.. Risks inherent in our industry include the risks of equipment defects, vehicle accidents, fires, explosions, blowouts, surface cratering, uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids, pipe or pipeline failures, abnormally pressured formations and various environmental hazards such as oil spills and releases of, and exposure to, hazardous substances. For example, our operations are subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing, including any mishandling, surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids, including chemical additives. The occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean - up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties, suspension of operations and repairs required to resume operations. The cost of managing such risks may be significant. The frequency and severity of such incidents will affect operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators. In particular, our customers may elect not to purchase our products or services if they view our environmental or safety record as unacceptable, which could cause us to lose customers and substantial revenues.. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities we may suffer. Also, insurance may no longer be available to us or its availability may be at premium levels that do not justify its purchase. The occurrence of a significant uninsured claim, a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations. This may cause us to restrict our operations, which might severely impact our financial condition.. A terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.. The occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries, anti - terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries, including continued hostilities in the Middle East, may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. If any of these events occur, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas, potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our services and causing a reduction in our revenues. Oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers' operations is destroyed or damaged. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.. If we are unable to fully protect our intellectual property rights or trade secrets, we may suffer a loss in our competitive advantage or market share.. We do not have patents relating to many of our key processes and technology. If we are not able to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets, or if our customers or competitors are able to replicate our technology or services, our competitive advantage would be diminished. We also cannot assure you that any patents we may obtain in the future would provide us with any significant commercial benefit or would allow us to prevent our competitors from employing comparable technologies or processes.. 22. Table of Contents. Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock. We are a holding company. Our only material asset is our equity interest in Cactus LLC, and accordingly, we are dependent upon distributions from Cactus LLC to pay taxes, make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and cover our corporate and other overhead expenses.. We are a holding company and have no material assets other than our equity interest in Cactus LLC. We have no independent means of generating revenue. To the extent Cactus LLC has available cash and subject to the terms of any current or future credit agreements or debt instruments, we intend to cause Cactus LLC to make (i) generally pro rata distributions to its unitholders, including us, in an amount at least sufficient to allow us to pay our taxes and to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) non - pro rata payments to us to reimburse us for our corporate and other overhead expenses. To the extent that we need funds and Cactus LLC or its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions or payments under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of any future financing arrangements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, our financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.. Moreover, because we have no independent means of generating revenue, our ability to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement is dependent on the ability of Cactus LLC to make distributions to us in an amount sufficient to cover our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. This ability, in turn, may depend on the ability of Cactus LLC's subsidiaries to make distributions to it. The ability of Cactus LLC, its subsidiaries and other entities in which it directly or indirectly holds an equity interest to make such distributions will be subject to, among other things, (i) the applicable provisions of Delaware law (or other applicable U.S. and foreign jurisdictions) that may limit the amount of funds available for distribution and (ii) restrictions in relevant debt instruments issued by Cactus LLC or its subsidiaries and other entities in which it directly or indirectly holds an equity interest. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid.. The requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the requirements of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost - effective manner.. As a public company, we need to comply with new laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act of 2002, related regulations of the SEC, including filing quarterly and annual financial statements, and the requirements of the NYSE, with which we were not required to comply as a private company. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements will occupy a significant amount of time of our board of directors and management and will significantly increase our costs and expenses. We need to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinstitute a more comprehensive compliance function, including for financial reporting and disclosures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcomply with rules promulgated by the NYSE;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontinue to prepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenhance our investor relations function;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablish new internal policies, such as those relating to insider trading; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinvolve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities.. 23. Table of Contents. The changes necessitated by becoming a public company require a significant commitment of resources and management oversight that has increased, and may continue to increase, our costs and might place a strain on our systems and resources. Such costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Furthermore, while we generally must comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act of 2002 for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, we are not required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls until our first annual report subsequent to our ceasing to be an \"emerging growth company\" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act. Accordingly, we may not be required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls until as late as our annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, although this could be required earlier. Once it is required to do so, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed. Compliance with these requirements may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost - effective manner.. In addition, we expect that being a public company subject to these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. We are currently evaluating these rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.. In the past, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future. Material weaknesses could affect the reliability of our financial statements and may cause to us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or fail to prevent fraud, which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our Class A Common Stock.. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent or detect fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.. In connection with the audit of the consolidated financial statements of Cactus LLC, our predecessor for accounting purposes, for the year ended December 31, 2016, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. We did not effectively operate controls in place over the review of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. This resulted in the identification of certain errors in the consolidated statement of cash flows that have been corrected as a revision of that statement. Please read \"Item 9A. Remediation of Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\" The material weakness described above or any newly identified material weakness could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.. In addition, neither our management nor an independent registered public accounting firm has performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act because no such evaluation has been required. Had we or our independent registered public accounting firm performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act, additional material weaknesses may have been identified.. 24. Table of Contents. Material weaknesses could affect the reliability of our financial statements and may cause to us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or fail to prevent fraud, which would harm our business, and could negatively impact investor perceptions. This could negatively impact the price of our Class A Common Stock.. Additionally, our reporting obligations as a public company will place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future and may cause us to fail to timely achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting. Please see \" - The requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost - effective manner.\". Our stock price may be volatile.. The market price of our Class A Common Stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. In the event of a drop in the market price of our Class A Common Stock, you could lose a substantial part or all of your investment in our Class A Common Stock. The following factors could affect our stock price:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour operating and financial performance;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tquarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as net income per share, net income and revenues;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe public reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstrategic actions by our competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in revenue or earnings estimates, or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage, by equity research analysts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tspeculation in the press or investment community;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe failure of research analysts to cover our Class A Common Stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsales of our Class A Common Stock by us or the perception that such sales may occur;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in accounting principles, policies, guidance, interpretations or standards;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadditions or departures of key management personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactions by our shareholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdomestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe realization of any risks described under this \"Risk Factors\" section.. 25. Table of Contents. The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company's securities. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert our management's attention and resources and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Cadent and Cactus WH Enterprises will have the ability to direct the voting of a majority of the voting power of our common stock, and their interests may conflict with those of our other shareholders.. Holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our shareholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law or our certificate of incorporation. Cadent owns approximately 49.2% of our Class B common stock (representing 31.8% of our voting power) and Cactus WH Enterprises owns approximately 46.6% of our Class B common stock (representing 30.2% of our voting power).. As a result, Cadent and Cactus WH Enterprises will be able to control matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, changes to our organizational documents and significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership makes it unlikely that any holder or group of holders of our Class A Common Stock will be able to affect the way we are managed or the direction of our business. The interests of Cadent and Cactus WH Enterprises with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us, such as future acquisitions, financings and other corporate opportunities and attempts to acquire us, may conflict with the interests of our other shareholders. Cadent and Cactus WH Enterprises would have to approve any potential acquisition of us. In addition, one of our directors is currently a partner of Cadent Energy Partners. This director's duties as a partner of Cadent Energy Partners may conflict with his duties as our director, and the resolution of these conflicts may not always be in our or your best interest. Furthermore, in connection with our IPO, we entered into a stockholders' agreement with Cadent and Cactus WH Enterprises. Among other things, the stockholders' agreement provides each of Cadent and Cactus WH Enterprises with the right to designate a certain number of nominees to our board of directors so long as they and their respective affiliates collectively beneficially own at least 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. The existence of significant shareholders and the stockholders' agreement may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management or limiting the ability of our other shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in our best interests. Cadent and Cactus WH Enterprises' concentration of stock ownership may also adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with significant shareholders.. Certain of our directors have significant duties with, and spend significant time serving, entities that may compete with us in seeking acquisitions and business opportunities and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating time or pursuing business opportunities.. Certain of our directors, who are responsible for managing the direction of our operations and acquisition activities, hold positions of responsibility with other entities (including Cadent and its affiliated entities) whose businesses are similar to our business. The existing positions held by these directors may give rise to fiduciary or other duties that are in conflict with the duties they owe to us. These directors may become aware of business opportunities that may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as to the other entities with which they are or may become affiliated. Due to these existing and potential future affiliations, they may present potential business opportunities to other entities prior to presenting them to us, which could cause additional conflicts of interest. They may also decide that certain opportunities are more appropriate for other entities with which they are affiliated, and as a result, they may elect not to present those opportunities to us. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor.. 26. Table of Contents. Cadent and its affiliates are not limited in their ability to compete with us, and the corporate opportunity provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation could enable Cadent to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us.. Our governing documents provide that Cadent and its affiliates (including portfolio investments of Cadent and its affiliates) are not restricted from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. In particular, subject to the limitations of applicable law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpermits Cadent and its affiliates, including any of our directors affiliated with Cadent, to conduct business that competes with us and to make investments in any kind of business, asset or property in which we may make investments; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovides that if Cadent or its affiliates, including any of our directors affiliated with Cadent, becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter, they will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us (unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such director in his capacity as one of our directors).. Cadent and its affiliates, or our non - employee directors, may become aware, from time to time, of certain business opportunities (such as, among other things, acquisition opportunities) and may direct such opportunities to other businesses in which they have invested, in which case we may not become aware of or otherwise have the ability to pursue such opportunity. Further, such businesses may choose to compete with us for these opportunities, possibly causing these opportunities to not be available to us or causing them to be more expensive for us to pursue. In addition, Cadent and its affiliates, or our non - employee directors, may dispose of assets owned by them in the future, without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase any of those assets. As a result, our renouncing our interest and expectancy in any business opportunity that may be from time to time presented to Cadent and its affiliates, or our non - employee directors, could adversely impact our business or prospects if attractive business opportunities are procured by such parties for their own benefit rather than for ours.. Cadent and its affiliates potentially have access to resources greater than ours, which may make it more difficult for us to compete with Cadent and its affiliates with respect to commercial activities as well as for potential acquisitions. We cannot assure you that any conflicts that may arise between us and our shareholders, on the one hand, and Cadent, on the other hand, will be resolved in our favor. As a result, competition from Cadent and its affiliates could adversely impact our results of operations.. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock.. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our shareholders, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimitations on the removal of directors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimitations on the ability of our shareholders to call special meetings;. 27. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablishing advance notice provisions for shareholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of shareholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproviding that the board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal our bylaws; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablishing advance notice and certain information requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings.. In addition, certain change of control events have the effect of accelerating the payment due under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which could be substantial and accordingly serve as a disincentive to a potential acquirer of our company. Please see \" - In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\". Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\"), our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described in the preceding sentence. This choice of forum provision may limit a shareholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Future sales of our Class A Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.. Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the CW Unit Holders may cause Cactus LLC to redeem their CW Units for shares of Class A Common Stock (on a one - for - one basis, subject to conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassification and other similar transactions) and then sell those shares of Class A Common Stock. Additionally, we may issue additional shares of Class A Common Stock or convertible securities in subsequent public offerings. We have 26,450,000 outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and 48,439,772 outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock. The CW Unit Holders own 48,439,772 shares of Class B Common Stock, representing approximately 64.7% of our total outstanding common stock. All such shares of Class B Common Stock are restricted from immediate resale under the federal securities laws and are subject to the lock - up agreements between such parties and the underwriters but may be sold into the market in the future. Cadent and Cactus WH Enterprises are party to a registration rights agreement between us and the Pre-IPO Owners, which will require us to effect the registration of their. 28. Table of Contents. shares in certain circumstances no earlier than the expiration of the lock - up period contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with our IPO.. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Class A Common Stock or securities convertible into Class A Common Stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our Class A Common Stock will have on the market price of our Class A Common Stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A Common Stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A Common Stock.. Under certain circumstances, redemptions of CW Units by CW Unit Holders will result in dilution to the holders of our Class A Common Stock.. Redemptions of CW Units by CW Unit Holders in accordance with the terms of the Cactus Wellhead LLC Agreement will result in a corresponding increase in our membership interest in Cactus LLC, increase in the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding and decrease in the number of shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding. In the event that CW Units are exchanged at a time when Cactus LLC has made cash distributions to CW Unit Holders, including Cactus Inc., and Cactus Inc. has accumulated such distributions and neither reinvests them in Cactus LLC in exchange for additional CW Units nor distributes them as dividends to the holders of Cactus Inc.'s Class A Common Stock, the holders of our Class A Common Stock would experience dilution with respect to such accumulated distributions.. Cactus Inc. will be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for certain tax benefits that we may claim, and the amounts of such payments could be significant.. In connection with our IPO, we entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with the TRA Holders. This agreement will generally provide for the payment by Cactus Inc. to the TRA Holders of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax and franchise tax that Cactus Inc. actually realizes or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances as a result of certain increases in tax basis and certain benefits attributable to imputed interest. Cactus Inc. will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these net cash savings.. The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement will continue until all tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement have been utilized or expired, unless we exercise our right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement (or the Tax Receivable Agreement is terminated due to other circumstances, including our breach of a material obligation thereunder or certain mergers or other changes of control), and we make the termination payment specified in the Tax Receivable Agreement. In addition, payments we make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be increased by any interest accrued from the due date (without extensions) of the corresponding tax return. In the event that the Tax Receivable Agreement is not terminated, the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are anticipated to commence in 2019 and to continue for 16 years after the date of the last redemption of CW Units.. The payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are our obligations and not obligations of Cactus LLC, and we expect that the payments we will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial. Estimating the amount and timing of payments that may become due under the Tax Receivable Agreement is by its nature imprecise. For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, cash savings in tax generally are calculated by comparing our actual tax liability (determined by using the actual applicable U.S. federal income tax rate and an assumed combined state and local income tax rate) to the amount we would have been required to pay had we not been able to utilize any of the tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. The amounts payable, as well as the timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, are dependent upon significant future events and assumptions, including the timing of the redemption of CW Units, the price of our Class A Common Stock at the time of each redemption, the extent to which such redemptions are taxable transactions, the amount of the redeeming unit holder's tax basis in its CW Units at the time of the relevant redemption, the depreciation and amortization periods that. 29. Table of Contents. apply to the increase in tax basis, the amount and timing of taxable income we generate in the future and the U.S. federal income tax rates then applicable, and the portion of our payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that constitute imputed interest or give rise to depreciable or amortizable tax basis. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will not be conditioned upon a holder of rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement having a continued ownership interest in us.. In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.. If we elect to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early or it is terminated early due to Cactus Inc.'s failure to honor a material obligation thereunder or due to certain mergers or other changes of control, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement would accelerate and we would be required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future payments to be made by us under the Tax Receivable Agreement (determined by applying a discount rate of one - year LIBOR plus 150 basis points) and such payment is expected to be substantial. The calculation of anticipated future payments will be based upon certain assumptions and deemed events set forth in the Tax Receivable Agreement, including (i) the assumption that we have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the tax benefits covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) the assumption that any CW Units (other than those held by Cactus Inc.) outstanding on the termination date are deemed to be redeemed on the termination date. Any early termination payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of the future tax benefits to which the termination payment relates.. As a result of either an early termination or a change of control, we could be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that exceed our actual cash tax savings under the Tax Receivable Agreement. In these situations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, or other forms of business combinations or changes of control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.. Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we will determine. The TRA Holders will not reimburse us for any payments previously made under the Tax Receivable Agreement if any tax benefits that have given rise to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are subsequently disallowed, except that excess payments made to any TRA Holder will be netted against payments that would otherwise be made to such TRA Holder, if any, after our determination of such excess. As a result, in some circumstances, we could make payments that are greater than our actual cash tax savings, if any, and may not be able to recoup those payments, which could adversely affect our liquidity.. If Cactus LLC were to become a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and Cactus LLC might be subject to potentially significant tax inefficiencies, and we would not be able to recover payments previously made by us under the Tax Receivable Agreement even if the corresponding tax benefits were subsequently determined to have been unavailable due to such status.. We intend to operate such that Cactus LLC does not become a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A \"publicly traded partnership\" is a partnership the interests of which are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof. Under certain circumstances, redemptions of CW Units pursuant to the Redemption Right (or our Call Right) or other transfers of CW Units could cause Cactus LLC to be treated as a publicly traded partnership. Applicable U.S. Treasury regulations provide for certain safe harbors from treatment as a publicly traded partnership, and we intend to operate such that one or more such safe harbors shall apply. For example, we intend to limit the number of unitholders of Cactus LLC, and the Cactus Wellhead LLC Agreement, which was entered into in connection with the closing of our IPO, provides for limitations on the ability of CW Unit Holders to transfer their CW Units and provides us, as managing. 30. Table of Contents. member of Cactus LLC, with the right to impose restrictions (in addition to those already in place) on the ability of unitholders of Cactus LLC to redeem their CW Units pursuant to the Redemption Right to the extent we believe it is necessary to ensure that Cactus LLC will continue to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.. If Cactus LLC were to become a publicly traded partnership, significant tax inefficiencies might result for us and for Cactus LLC, including as a result of our inability to file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with Cactus LLC. In addition, we would no longer have the benefit of certain increases in tax basis covered under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and we would not be able to recover any payments previously made by us under the Tax Receivable Agreement, even if the corresponding tax benefits (including any claimed increase in the tax basis of Cactus LLC's assets) were subsequently determined to have been unavailable.. If Cactus Inc. were deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\"), as a result of its ownership of Cactus LLC, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for Cactus Inc. to continue its business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on its business.. Under Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the 1940 Act, a company generally will be deemed to be an \"investment company\" for purposes of the 1940 Act if (i) it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities or (ii) it engages, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We do not believe that Cactus Inc. is an \"investment company,\" as such term is defined in either of those sections of the 1940 Act. As the sole managing member of Cactus LLC, Cactus Inc. will control and operate Cactus LLC. On that basis, we believe that Cactus Inc.'s interest in Cactus LLC is not an \"investment security\" as that term is used in the 1940 Act. However, if Cactus Inc. were to cease participation in the management of Cactus LLC, its interest in Cactus LLC could be deemed an \"investment security\" for purposes of the 1940 Act. Cactus Inc. and Cactus LLC intend to conduct their operations so that Cactus Inc. will not be deemed an investment company. However, if Cactus Inc. were to be deemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on Cactus Inc.'s capital structure and its ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for Cactus Inc. to continue its business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on its business.. We may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our Class A Common Stock.. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our Class A Common Stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine.
