[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. We encourage you to consider carefully the risk factors described below, in addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our performance depends entirely on the operations and management of the Partnership. Consequently, risks and uncertainties affecting the Partnership will directly affect our performance. Specifically, see information regarding forward-looking statements and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors included in the Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and its subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act for a discussion of risks to the Partnership that also may affect us. We incorporate by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS. BECAUSE OUR ASSETS ARE THE i-UNITS ISSUED BY THE PARTNERSHIP TO US, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS DEPEND ENTIRELY ON OUR MANAGEMENT AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PARTNERSHIP.. We are a limited partner of the Partnership and our only assets are the i-units that the Partnership has issued to us. As a result, our performance depends entirely on the Partnership's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The risks and uncertainties that affect the Partnership, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows also affect us and the value of our Listed Shares.. THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF ADDITIONAL SHARES THAT WE MAKE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS DEPEND ON THE AMOUNT OF CASH THAT THE PARTNERSHIP DISTRIBUTES TO THE HOLDERS OF ITS CLASS A UNITS.. When the Partnership makes a cash distribution to the holders of its Class A common units, we distribute to each holder of our shares in respect of each share such holder owns that fraction of a share determined by dividing the amount of the cash distribution paid by the Partnership with respect to each common unit by the average market price of one of our Listed Shares. Therefore, if the Partnership decreases the cash distributions that it pays to the holders of its common units, as it did commencing with the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the value of the distributions of additional shares that we make to our shareholders will decrease as well.. Our board of directors may establish cash reserves at the Partnership that it believes are necessary to fund the Partnership's future operating and capital expenditures, provide for the proper conduct of its business, comply with applicable laws or agreements to which the Partnership is a party, or provide funds for future distributions to partners. These cash reserves affect the amount of cash available for distribution by the Partnership to the holders of its common units and, consequently, the value of the distributions of additional shares that we make to our shareholders.. In addition, the fraction of a share to be issued in each quarterly distribution on our outstanding shares is based on the average closing price of our shares for the 10-day trading period immediately preceding the ex-dividend date for our Listed Shares. Because the market price of our Listed Shares may vary substantially over time, the value of the additional shares that we distribute to our shareholders may vary substantially from the cash that they would have received had they owned common units of the Partnership instead of our Listed Shares.. 3. TABLE OF CONTENTS. THE PARTNERSHIP MAY ISSUE ADDITIONAL COMMON UNITS OR OTHER CLASSES OF UNITS AND WE MAY ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES, ANY OF WHICH WOULD DILUTE YOUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST.. The Partnership's issuance of additional common units or other classes of units or our issuance of shares, other than our quarterly distributions, may have the following effects:. • The amount available for distributions on each share may decrease;. • The relative voting power of each previously outstanding share may decrease; and. • The market price of the Listed Shares may decline.. Additionally, the public sale by the General Partner of a significant portion of the common units that it currently owns could reduce the market price of the Class A common units and, indirectly, the market price of our shares. The Partnership Agreement allows the General Partner to cause the Partnership to register for public sale any units held by the General Partner or one of its affiliates. A public sale of the common units currently held by the General Partner could absorb some of the trading market demand for the outstanding Class A common units, which indirectly could reduce the market price of our shares. In addition, the General Partner may sell its common units in private transactions at any time, which could have a similar effect on the market for the outstanding Class A common units and, indirectly, the market for our shares.. IF WE ARE NOT FULLY REIMBURSED OR INDEMNIFIED FOR OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES WE INCUR IN MANAGING THE BUSINESS AND AFFAIRS OF THE PARTNERSHIP, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PAY THOSE LIABILITIES AND THE VALUE OF OUR SHARES COULD DECLINE.. Under the delegation of control agreement, the General Partner has delegated to us management of the Partnership and its operating subsidiaries. To the extent we incur liabilities or other obligations in connection with our performance under the delegation of control agreement, we are entitled to be reimbursed or indemnified by the Partnership to the same extent as the General Partner is entitled to be reimbursed or indemnified under the Partnership Agreement. In the event the Partnership and the General Partner are either unwilling or unable to reimburse or indemnify us, we likely will be unable to satisfy these liabilities or obligations. Additionally, our right to reimbursement or indemnification is limited under certain circumstances, including if we act in bad faith or if we violate laws, like the United States federal securities laws, for which indemnification may be against public policy.. IF IN THE FUTURE WE CEASE TO MANAGE THE BUSINESS AND AFFAIRS OF THE PARTNERSHIP, WE MAY BE DEEMED TO BE AN INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940.. If we cease to manage the Partnership's business and are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act, we would either have to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, obtain exemptive relief from the SEC, or modify our organizational structure or our contract rights to fall outside the definition of an investment company. Registering as an investment company could, among other things, materially limit our ability to engage in transactions with our affiliates, including the purchase and sale of certain securities or other property to or from our affiliates, restrict our ability to borrow funds or engage in other transactions involving leverage and require us to add directors who are independent of us or our affiliates.. TAX RISKS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. As our only cash-generating assets consists of our capital interest in the Partnership, our tax risks are primarily derivative of the tax risks associated with an investment in the Partnership.. IF THE PARTNERSHIP WERE TREATED AS A CORPORATION FOR UNITED STATES FEDERAL, OR STATE OR LOCAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, THE VALUE OF OUR SHARES WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED AND THE OWNER OF OUR VOTING SHARES WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO MERGE US INTO THE PARTNERSHIP.. 4. TABLE OF CONTENTS. The anticipated benefit of an investment in our shares depends largely on the continued treatment of the Partnership as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes. Current law requires the Partnership to derive at least 90% of its annual gross income from specific activities to continue to be treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes. The Partnership may not find it possible, regardless of its efforts, to meet this income requirement or may inadvertently fail to meet this income requirement. A change in current law may also cause the Partnership to be treated as a corporation for United States federal, or state or local income tax purposes without regard to its sources of income or otherwise subject the Partnership to entity-level taxation. In addition, several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation.. If the Partnership were to be treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes, it would pay United States federal income tax on its income at the applicable corporate tax rate, and such treatment also may subject the Partnership to state or local income taxes at varying rates. Additional taxes imposed on the Partnership as a result of being treated as a corporation could substantially reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to the holders of its common units, which in turn could reduce the value of the i-units we own and the value of our Listed Shares. In addition, the automatic increase in the number of i-units that we will own after each quarterly distribution of cash to holders of common units generally would be a taxable distribution to us. Therefore, treatment of the Partnership as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to us, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our shares.. Under the provisions of our limited liability company agreement and the Partnership Agreement, if the Partnership were to be treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes, the owner of our voting shares has the right to cause us to merge with or into the Partnership or one of its subsidiaries. As a condition to such merger, we must obtain either an opinion of counsel that such merger should be currently non-taxable to holders of our shares or a ruling from the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that such merger will be currently non-taxable to holders of our shares, except as to the consideration received for fractional shares or as to the termination of any rights or obligations related to the purchase provisions. In such an event, our shareholders would receive common units or other securities substantially similar to the common units in exchange for their shares.. The Partnership's partnership agreement provides that if legislation is enacted that subjects the Partnership to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects the Partnership to entity-level taxation for United States federal income tax purposes, the Partnership's minimum quarterly distribution and target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that legislation on the Partnership. If this were to happen, the amount of distributions we receive from the Partnership and our resulting cash flows could be reduced substantially, which would adversely affect the value of our shares.. THE TAX TREATMENT OF PUBLICLY TRADED PARTNERSHIPS SUCH AS THE PARTNERSHIP COULD BE SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES OR DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS, POSSIBLY APPLIED ON A RETROACTIVE BASIS.. The present United States federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including the Partnership, or an investment in the Partnership's common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time. From time to time, members of Congress have proposed and considered substantive changes to the existing United States federal income tax laws that would affect publicly traded partnerships. Although there is no current legislative proposal, a prior legislative proposal would have eliminated the qualifying income exception to the treatment of all publicly traded partnerships as corporations upon which the Partnership relies for its treatment as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes. In addition, on January 24, 2017, final regulations regarding which activities give rise to qualifying income within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code (the \"Final Regulations\") were published in the Federal Register. The Final Regulations are effective as of January 19, 2017, and apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 19, 2017.  We do not believe the Final Regulations affect the Partnership's ability to be treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes.. However, any modification to the United States federal income tax laws may be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to meet the exception for certain publicly traded partnerships to be treated as partnerships for United States federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes. 5. TABLE OF CONTENTS. or other proposals will be reintroduced or ultimately will be enacted. Any similar or future legislative changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in shares.. RISKS ARISING FROM OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH ENBRIDGE, THE GENERAL PARTNER, AND THE PARTNERSHIP. OUR SHARES ARE SUBJECT TO PURCHASE PROVISIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN OUR SHAREHOLDERS HAVING TO SELL THEIR SHARES AT A TIME OR PRICE THAT MAY BE UNFAVORABLE.. If Enbridge were to exercise any of its rights to purchase our shares that are held by the public, those shareholders would be required to sell their shares for cash at a time or price that may be undesirable, and could receive an amount of cash that is less than the amount they paid for their shares. Any such sale would be taxable for United States federal income tax purposes, and the individual shareholders would recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and the tax basis in the shares sold.. HOLDERS OF OUR LISTED SHARES ARE NOT ENTITLED TO VOTE TO ELECT OUR DIRECTORS, AND, THEREFORE, WILL HAVE LITTLE OR NO OPPORTUNITY TO INFLUENCE OR CHANGE OUR MANAGEMENT.. Owners of our Listed Shares have little or no opportunity to influence or change our management, because Enbridge indirectly owns all of our voting shares and elects all of our directors. Through the election of our directors, Enbridge indirectly controls us and the Partnership.. A PERSON OR GROUP OWNING 20% OR MORE OF THE AGGREGATE NUMBER OF PARTNERSHIP'S ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON UNITS AND OUR SHARES, OTHER THAN ENBRIDGE AND ITS AFFILIATES, MAY NOT VOTE THE COMMON UNITS OR SHARES, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEY WOULD RECEIVE A PREMIUM FOR THEIR SHARES IN A HOSTILE TAKEOVER.. A person or group owning 20% or more of the aggregate number of the Partnership's issued and outstanding common units and our shares, other than Enbridge and its affiliates, may not vote its common units or shares, which could reduce the possibility that they would receive a premium for their shares in a hostile takeover. This limitation may:. • Discourage a person or group from attempting to take over control of us or the Partnership; and. • Reduce the price at which our shares will trade under certain circumstances.. For example, this limitation could have the result of discouraging a third-party from attempting to remove the General Partner and take over our management of the Partnership by making a tender offer for the common units at a price above their trading market price.. THE TERMS OF OUR SHARES MAY BE CHANGED WITHOUT SHAREHOLDER PERMISSIONS, BECAUSE OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS THE POWER TO CHANGE THE TERMS OF OUR SHARES IN WAYS OUR BOARD DETERMINES, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION ARE NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS.. Shareholders may not like the changes, if any, to the terms of our shares made by our board of directors, and may disagree with our board's determination that the changes are not materially adverse. If a shareholder should disagree with our board's decisions, the recourse will be limited because our limited liability company agreement gives broad latitude and discretion to our board of directors and eliminates or reduces many of the fiduciary duties that our board of directors otherwise would owe to shareholders.. OUR LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AGREEMENT LIMITS THE FIDUCIARY DUTIES THAT OUR DIRECTORS OWE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND RESTRICTS THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS FOR ACTIONS TAKEN BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE CONSTITUTE A BREAK OF A FIDUCIARY DUTY.. 6. TABLE OF CONTENTS. Our limited liability company agreement contains provisions that modify the fiduciary duties that our board of directors otherwise would owe to our shareholders under state fiduciary duty law. For example, our limited liability company agreement:. • Permits our board of directors to make a number of decisions, including the determination of which factors it will consider in resolving conflicts of interest, in its \"sole discretion,\" which entitles our board of directors to consider only the interests and factors that it desires, with no duty or obligation to give consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or any shareholder;. • Provides that Enbridge, its affiliates, and their respective officers and directors, who in most cases are also our officers and directors, are not required to offer us any business opportunities; and. • Provides that none of our directors or officers will be liable to us or any other person for any act or omission taken or omitted by such director or officer, so long as such director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner that such director or officer reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, our best interests.. These and similar provisions in our limited liability company agreement may restrict the remedies available to our shareholders for actions taken by our board of directors that might otherwise constitute a breach of a fiduciary duty. The Partnership Agreement contains similar provisions that modify the fiduciary duties that the board of directors of the General Partner would otherwise owe to the Partnership's unitholders under state fiduciary duty law. As the delegate of the General Partner, these provisions apply to our directors and officers in managing the business and affairs of the Partnership.. POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST MAY ARISE AMONG ENBRIDGE AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS, ON THE ONE HAND, AND US AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND THE PARTNERSHIP AND ITS UNITHOLDERS, ON THE OTHER HAND. BECAUSE THE FIDUCIARY DUTIES OF OUR DIRECTORS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY BE PERMITTED TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT BENEFIT ENBRIDGE AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS OR THE PARTNERSHIP AND ITS UNITHOLDERS MORE THAN US AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS.. Conflicts of interest may arise from time to time among Enbridge and its shareholders, on the one hand, and us and our shareholders and the Partnership and its unitholders, on the other hand. Conflicts of interest may also arise from time to time between us and our shareholders, on the one hand, and the Partnership, its unitholders and/or the General Partner, on the other hand. In managing and controlling us and the Partnership, our board of directors may consider the interests of all parties to a conflict and may resolve those conflicts by making decisions that benefit Enbridge and its shareholders or the Partnership and its unitholders more than us and our shareholders. The following decisions, among others, could involve conflicts of interest:. • Whether the Partnership or Enbridge will pursue certain acquisitions or other business opportunities;. • Whether the Partnership will issue additional units or other equity securities or whether it will purchase outstanding units;. • Whether the General Partner will sell units of the Partnership its holds;. • Whether we will issue additional shares;. • The amount of payments to Enbridge and its affiliates for any services rendered for the Partnership's benefit;. • The amount of costs that is reimbursable to us or Enbridge by the Partnership;. • The outcomes resulting from actions taken in connection with the Partnership's 2017 strategic review, including the simplification of its capital structure;. • The enforcement of obligations owed to the Partnership by us, the General Partner and Enbridge, including obligations regarding competition between Enbridge and the Partnership; and. 7. TABLE OF CONTENTS. • The retention of separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us and the Partnership.. In these and similar situations, any decision by our board of directors may benefit one group more than another, and in making such decisions, our board of directors may consider the interests of all groups, as well as other factors, in deciding whether to take a particular course of action.. In other situations, Enbridge may take certain actions, including engaging in businesses that compete with the Partnership, that are adverse to us and our shareholders and the Partnership and its unitholders. For example, although Enbridge and its subsidiaries are generally restricted from engaging in any business that is in direct material competition with our businesses, that restriction is subject to the following significant exceptions:. • Enbridge and its subsidiaries are not restricted from continuing to engage in businesses, including the normal development of such businesses, in which they were engaged at the time of the Partnership's initial public offering in December 1991;. • Such restriction is limited geographically only to those routes and products for which the Partnership provided transportation at the time of its initial public offering;. • Enbridge and its subsidiaries are not prohibited from acquiring any business that materially and directly competes with the Partnership as part of a larger acquisition, so long as the majority of the value of the business or assets acquired, in Enbridge's reasonable judgment, is not attributable to the competitive business; and. • Enbridge and its subsidiaries are not prohibited from acquiring any business that materially and directly competes with the Partnership if that business is first offered for acquisition to the Partnership and our board of directors and the Partnership's unitholders determine not to pursue the acquisition.. As a result of these exceptions, Enbridge and its subsidiaries would be permitted to transport crude oil and liquid petroleum over routes that are not the same as the Partnership's Lakehead System, even if such transportation is in direct material competition with the Partnership's business.. IN THE EVENT OF A LIQUIDATION OF THE PARTNERSHIP NOT RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY THE PARTNERSHIP OR OTHERWISE APPROVED BY US AT THE DIRECTION OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS, THE VALUE OF OUR SHARES WOULD LIKELY DECLINE.. The Partnership may not take any action to cause a liquidation of the Partnership unless, prior to such liquidation, Enbridge has agreed to purchase all of our shares or we have voted to approve such liquidation at the direction of our shareholders. In the event of a liquidation of the Partnership not resulting from any action taken by the Partnership or otherwise approved by us at the direction of our shareholders, the value of our shares will depend on the after-tax amount of the liquidating distribution received by us as the owner of i-units. The terms of the i-units provide that no allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction will be made in respect of the i-units until such time as there is a liquidation of the Partnership. If there is a liquidation of the Partnership, it is intended that we will be allocated income and gain in an amount necessary for the capital account attributable to each i-unit to be equal to that of a common unit. As a result, we likely will realize taxable income upon the liquidation of the Partnership. However, there may not be sufficient amounts of income and gain to cause the capital account attributable to each i-unit to be equal to that of a common unit. If they are not equal, we and, therefore, our shareholders will receive less value than would be received by an owner of common units. In that event, the liquidating distribution per common unit will exceed the liquidating distribution per i-unit.. Further, the tax indemnity provided to us by Enbridge only indemnifies us for our tax liabilities arising out of a transaction involving the i-units to the extent we have not received sufficient cash in the transaction generating the tax liability to pay the associated tax. Prior to any liquidation of the Partnership, we do not expect to receive cash in a taxable transaction. If a liquidation of the Partnership occurs, however, we likely would receive cash which we would use, at least in part, to pay taxes. As a result, our residual value and the value of our shares will likely be less than the value of the common units upon the liquidation of the Partnership."
