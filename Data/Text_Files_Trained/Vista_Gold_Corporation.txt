[1] "ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS.. An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk.  The risks described below are not the only ones facing the Company or otherwise associated with an investment in our securities.  Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect our business.  If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.. Operating Risks. We cannot be assured that Mt Todd is feasible or that a feasibility study will accurately forecast operating results.. Mt Todd is our principal asset. Our future profitability depends largely on the economic feasibility of the project. Before arranging financing for Mt Todd, we will have to complete a feasibility study.  There can be no assurance that the mining and comminution processes including ore sorting, gold production rates, revenue, capital and operating costs. 13. Table of Contents. including taxes and royalties will not vary unfavorably from the estimates and assumptions included in the feasibility study.. Mt Todd requires substantial capital investment and we may be unable to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms or at all.. The construction and operation of Mt Todd will require significant capital. Our ability to raise sufficient capital will depend on several factors, including a favorable feasibility study, acquisition of the requisite permits, macroeconomic conditions, and future gold prices. Uncontrollable factors such as lower gold prices, unanticipated operating or permitting challenges, perception of environmental impact, illiquidity in the debt markets or equity markets, could impede our ability to finance Mt Todd on acceptable terms, if at all.. If we decide to construct the mine at Mt Todd, we will be assuming certain reclamation obligations resulting in a material financial obligation.. The Mt Todd site was not reclaimed when the original mine closed.  Although we are not currently responsible for the reclamation of these historical disturbances, we will accept full responsibility for them if and when we make a decision to finance and construct the mine and we provide 30 days' notice to NT Government of our intention to take over and assume the management, operation and rehabilitation of Mt Todd.  At that time, we will be required to provide a bond in a form and amount satisfactory to the NT Government (in whose jurisdiction Mt Todd is located) that would cover the prospective expense of the reclamation of the property.  In addition, the regulatory authorities may increase reclamation and bonding requirements from time to time.  The satisfaction of these bonding requirements and continuing or future reclamation obligations will require a significant amount of capital.. We may not be able to get the required permits to begin construction at Mt Todd in a timely manner or at all.. Any delay in acquiring the requisite permits, or failure to receive required governmental approvals could delay or prevent the start of construction of Mt Todd.  If we are unable to acquire permits to mine the property, then the project cannot be developed and operated; in addition, the property will have no reserves under SEC Industry Guide 7 and NI 43-101, which would result in an impairment of the carrying value of the project.. There may be other delays in the construction of Mt Todd.. Delays in commencement of construction could result from factors such as availability and performance of engineering and construction contractors, suppliers and consultants; availability of required equipment; and availability of capital. Any delay in the performance of any one or more of the contractors, suppliers, consultants or other persons on which we depend, or lack of availability of required equipment, or delay or failure to receive required governmental approvals, or financing could delay or prevent commencement of construction at Mt Todd. There can be no assurance of whether or when construction at Mt Todd will start or that the necessary personnel, equipment or supplies will be available to the Company if and when construction is started.. Increased costs could impede our ability to become profitable.. Costs at any particular mining location frequently are subject to variation due to a number of factors, such as changing ore grade, changing metallurgy, and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body.  In addition, costs are affected by the price of commodities, fuel, electricity, operating supplies and labor. These costs are at times subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make future production at Mt Todd less profitable or uneconomic. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.. 14. Table of Contents. We cannot be assured that we will have an adequate water supply at Mt Todd.. Water at Mt Todd is expected to be provided from a fresh water reservoir which is fed by seasonal rains. Insufficient rainfall, or drought-like conditions in the area feeding the reservoir could limit or extinguish this water supply, and sufficient water resources may not be available leading to operations stopping until the water supply is replenished.. We could be subject to litigation, allegations or other legal claims.. Our assets or our business activities may be subject to disputes that may result in litigation or other legal claims. We may be subject to allegations through press, social media or other mediums that may or may not be founded. We may be required to respond to or defend against these claims and/or allegations which will divert resources away from our principal business. There can be no assurance that our defense of such claims and/or allegations would be successful, and we may be required to make material settlements. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows, results of operations, and corporate reputation.. We rely on third parties to fulfill their obligations under agreements.. Our business strategy includes entering into agreements with third-parties (\"Partners\") which may earn the right to obtain an interest in certain of our projects, in part by managing the respective project. Whether or not we hold a majority interest in a respective project, our Partner(s) may: (i) have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with or opposed to ours; (ii) exercise veto rights to block actions that we believe to be in the best interests of the project; (iii) take action contrary to our policies or objectives; or (iv) as a result of financial or other difficulties, be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the respective joint venture, option, earn-in right or other agreement(s), such as contributing capital for the expansion or maintenance of projects.  Any one or a combination of these could result in liabilities for us and/or could adversely affect the value of the related project(s) and, by association, damage our reputation and consequently our ability to acquire or advance other projects and/or attract future Partners.. Our exploration and development interests are subject to evolving environmental regulations.. Our property and royalty interests are subject to environmental regulation. Environmental legislation is becoming more restrictive in some countries or jurisdictions in a manner that will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. There is no assurance that future changes in environmental regulation, if any, will not adversely affect our interests. Currently, our property and royalty interests are subject to government environmental regulations in Australia, Indonesia, Mexico and the U.S.. We could be subject to environmental lawsuits.. Neighboring landowners and other third parties could file claims based on environmental statutes and common law for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by environmental nuisance, the release of hazardous substances or other waste material into the environment on or around our properties.  There can be no assurance that our defense of such claims would be successful.  This could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operation, and corporate reputation.. We may have material undisclosed environmental liabilities of which we are not aware.. Vista has been engaged in gold exploration since 1983.  Since inception the Company has been involved in a large number of exploration projects in many different jurisdictions.  There may be environmental liabilities associated with disturbances at any of these projects for which the Company may be identified as a probable responsible party, regardless of its level of involvement in creating the related disturbance.  We may not be aware of such claims against the Company until regulators provide notice thereof. Consequently, we may have material undisclosed environmental responsibilities which could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and corporate reputation.. 15. Table of Contents. There may be challenges to our title to mineral properties.. There may be challenges to our title to our mineral properties. If there are title defects with respect to any of our properties, we may be required to compensate other persons or perhaps reduce our interest in the affected property. Also, in any such case, the investigation and resolution of title issues could divert Company resources from our core strategies.. Our exploration and development activities, strategic transactions, or any acquisition activities may not be commercially successful and fail to lead to gold production or fail to add value.. Substantial expenditures are required to acquire gold properties, to establish mineral reserves through drilling and analysis, to develop metallurgical processes to extract metal from the ore and to develop the mining and processing facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for mining. We cannot be assured that any mineral reserves or mineral resources acquired, established or discovered will be in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations, or an ability to execute a strategic transaction, or that the funds invested in them will ever be recovered.. Financial and Business Risks. A substantial or extended decline in gold prices would have a material adverse effect on the value of our assets, on our ability to raise capital and could result in lower than estimated economic returns.. The value of our assets, our ability to raise capital and our future economic returns are substantially dependent on the price of gold. The gold price fluctuates on a daily basis and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Factors tending to influence gold prices include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgold sales or leasing by governments and central banks or changes in their monetary policy, including gold inventory management and reallocation of reserves;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tspeculative short  or long positions on futures markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe relative strength of the U.S. dollar;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpectations of the future rate of inflation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinterest rates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges to economic activity in the United States, China, India and other industrialized or developing countries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeopolitical conflicts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in jewelry, investment or industrial demand;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in supply from production, disinvestment and scrap; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tforward sales by producers in hedging or similar transactions.. A substantial or extended decline in the gold price could:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnegatively impact our ability to raise capital on favorable terms, or at all;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tjeopardize the development of Mt Todd;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduce our existing estimated mineral resources and reserves by removing material from these estimates that could not be economically processed at the lower gold price;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduce the potential for future revenues from gold projects in which we have an interest;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduce funds available to operate our business; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduce the market value of our assets, including our investment in Midas Gold Shares.. Industry consolidation could result in the acquisition of a control position in the Company for less than fair value.. Consolidation within the industry is a growing trend. As a result of the broad market and industry factors including the price of gold, we believe the current market value of our common stock does not reflect the fair value of the Company's assets.  These conditions could result in the acquisition of a control position, or attempted acquisition of a control position in the Company at what we believe to be less than fair value. This could result in substantial costs to us and. 16. Table of Contents. divert our management's attention and resources. A completed acquisition could result in realized losses of shareholder value.. We have a history of losses, and we do not expect to generate earnings from operations or pay dividends in the near term.. We are an exploration stage enterprise.  As such, we devote our efforts to exploration, analysis and, if warranted, development of our projects.  We do not currently produce gold and do not currently generate operating earnings from gold production.  We finance our business activities principally by issuing equity and/or debt, and selling non-core assets.. We have incurred losses in all periods since 1998, except for the year ended December 31, 2011, during which we recorded non-cash net gains, and the year ended December 31, 2015 during which we recorded gains related to R&D Refunds. We expect to continue to incur losses. We have no history of paying cash dividends and we do not expect to be able to pay cash dividends or to make any similar distribution in the foreseeable future.. We may be unable to raise additional capital on favorable terms, if at all.. Our exploration and, if warranted, development activities and the construction and start-up of any mining operation require substantial amounts of capital. In order to develop Mt Todd, and/or to acquire attractive gold projects, we will have to raise additional funds from the sale of non-core assets and / or external sources. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in selling non-core assets or that additional financing will be available at all or on acceptable terms. If we cannot raise sufficient additional financing, we may have to substantially reduce or cease operations.. Our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance.. We are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulated organizations, including the British Columbia Securities Commission, the SEC, the Toronto Stock Exchange, the NYSE American, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by the United States Congress, making compliance increasingly more difficult and uncertain, which could have an adverse effect on reputation and our stock price.. We face intense competition in the mining industry.. The mining industry is intensely competitive in all of its phases. Some of our competitors are much larger, established mining companies with greater financial and technical resources than ours.  We compete with other mining companies for attractive mining claims, for capital, for equipment and supplies, for outside services and for qualified managerial and technical employees. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, we will be unable to execute exploration and development programs or such programs may be reduced in scope. Competition for equipment and supplies could result in shortage of necessary supplies and/or increased costs. Competition for outside services could result in increased costs, reduced quality of service and/or delays in completing services. If we cannot successfully retain or attract qualified employees, our ability to advance the development of Mt Todd, to attract necessary financing, to meet all of our environmental and regulatory responsibilities, or to take opportunities to improve our business, could be negatively affected. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and corporate reputation.. The occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our cash flow and overall profitability.. We maintain insurance policies that mitigate certain risks related to our operations. This insurance is maintained in amounts that we believe to be reasonable based on the circumstances surrounding each identified risk. However, we may elect not to have insurance for certain risks because of the high premiums associated with insuring those risks or for various other reasons; in other cases, insurance may not be available for certain risks. We do not insure against political. 17. Table of Contents. risk. Occurrence of events for which we are not insured could result in significant losses that could materially adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to fund our business.. Our share price may be volatile and your investment in our common shares could suffer a decline in value.. Broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.  Factors that could cause fluctuation in the price of our common stock may include, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstock market price and volume fluctuations of other publicly traded companies and, in particular, those that are in the mining industry;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tspeculation about our business in the press or the investment community;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconditions or trends in our industry or the economy generally;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the prices of gold;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadditions or departures of key personnel; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsales of our common stock, including sales by our directors, officers or significant stockholders.. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert our management's attention and resources.. Currency fluctuations may adversely affect our costs.. We have material property interests in Australia. Most costs in Australia are incurred in the local currency. The appreciation of the Australian dollar, if any, against the U.S. dollar effectively increases our cost of doing business in Australia. This could have the effect of increasing the amount of capital required to continue to explore and develop Mt Todd, and/or reducing the pace at which it is developed.. Our Australian Research and development (\"R&D\") grants are subject to review.. The Australian R&D tax incentive program, under which we have received certain grants related to qualifying R&D programs and expenditures, is a self-assessment process, and as such, the Australian Government has the right to review our qualifying programs and related expenditures for a period of four years. If such a review were to occur, and as a result of the review and failure of  a related appeal a qualified program and related expenditures were disqualified, the respective R&D grant could be recalled with penalties and interest.. The Company is likely a \"passive foreign investment company,\" which will likely have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences for U.S. shareholders.. U.S. shareholders of our common shares should be aware that the Company believes it was classified as a PFIC during the taxable year ended December 31, 2017, and based on current business plans and financial projections, management believes there is a significant likelihood that the Company will be a PFIC during the current taxable year.  If the Company is a PFIC for any year during a U.S. shareholder's holding period, then such U.S. shareholder generally will be required to treat any gain realized upon a disposition of Common Shares, or any so-called \"excess distribution\" received on their Common Shares, as ordinary income, and to pay an interest charge on a portion of such gain or distributions, unless the shareholder makes a timely and effective \"qualified electing fund\" (\"QEF Election\") or a \"mark-to-market\" election with respect to the Common Shares.  A U.S. shareholder who makes a QEF Election generally must report on a current basis its share of the net capital gain and ordinary earnings for any year in which the Company is PFIC, whether or not the Company distributes any amounts to its shareholders.  U.S. shareholders should be aware that there can be no assurance that the Company will satisfy record keeping requirements that apply to a QEF Election, or that the Company will supply U.S. shareholders with information that such U.S. shareholders require to report under the QEF Election rules, in event that the Company is a PFIC and a U.S. shareholder wishes to make a QEF Election.  Thus, U.S.. 18. Table of Contents. shareholders may not be able to make a QEF Election with respect to their Common Shares.  A U.S. shareholder who makes the mark-to-market election generally must include as ordinary income each year the excess of the fair market value of the Common Shares over the taxpayer's basis therein.  This paragraph is qualified in its entirety by the discussion below in \"Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - \"Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.\" Each U.S. shareholder should consult his or her own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal, U.S. state and local, and foreign tax consequences of the PFIC rules and the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of Common Shares.. Industry Risks. Calculations of mineral reserves and mineral resources are estimates only and subject to uncertainty.. The estimating of mineral reserves and mineral resources is an imprecise process and the accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quantity and quality of available data, the assumptions used and judgments made in interpreting engineering and geological information and estimating future capital and operating costs. There is significant uncertainty in any reserve or resource estimate, and the economic results of mining an ore deposit may differ materially from the estimates.. Feasibility studies are estimates only and subject to uncertainty.. Feasibility studies are used to determine the economic viability of an ore deposit, as are pre-feasibility studies and preliminary economic assessments. Feasibility studies are the most detailed studies and reflect a higher level of confidence in the estimated production rates, and capital and operating costs. Generally accepted levels of confidence are plus or minus 15% for feasibility studies, plus or minus 25-30% for pre-feasibility studies and plus or minus 35-40% for preliminary economic assessments. These levels reflect the levels of confidence that exist at the time the study is completed.  Subsequent changes to metal prices, foreign exchange rates (if applicable), reclamation requirements, operating and capital costs may differ materially from these estimates.. Mining companies are increasingly required to consider and provide benefits to the communities and countries in which they operate, and are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.. As a result of public concern about the real or perceived detrimental effects of economic globalization and global climate impacts, businesses in general and the mining industry in particular, face increasing public scrutiny of their activities. These businesses are under pressure to demonstrate that as they seek to generate satisfactory returns on investment to shareholders, other stakeholders, including employees, governments, indigenous peoples, communities surrounding operations and the countries in which they operate, benefit and will continue to benefit from their commercial activities. The potential consequences of these pressures include reputational damage, legal suits, increased costs, increased social investment obligations, difficulty in acquiring permits, and increased taxes and royalties payable to governments and communities.. Mining exploration, development and operating activities are inherently hazardous.. Mineral exploration involves many risks that even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. Operations in which we have direct or indirect interests will be subject to all the hazards and risks normally incidental to exploration, development and production of gold and other metals, any of which could result in work stoppages, damage to property, physical harm and possible environmental damage. The nature of these risks is such that liabilities might exceed any liability insurance policy limits. It is also possible that the liabilities and hazards might not be insurable, or, we could elect not to be insured against such liabilities due to high premium costs or other reasons, in which event, we could incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.. 19. Table of Contents. Regulations and pending legislation involving climate change could result in increased operating costs.. Gold production is energy intensive, resulting in a significant carbon footprint. A number of governments and/or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to various climate change interest groups and the potential impact of climate change. This type of legislation and possible future legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs related to increased energy requirements, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations.. Pending initiatives involving taxation could result in increased tax and operating costs.. There is growing attention from the media and the public on perceived international tax avoidance techniques which could result in escalating rates of poverty, inequality and unemployment in host countries. Initiatives like the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project being led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development aim to reform the system of international taxation to minimize international tax avoidance techniques. This initiative and possible future initiatives could result in increased tax expense and related compliance costs for future international mining operations."
