[1] "ITEM 1A.        RISK FACTORS. Limited partner interests are inherently different from capital stock of a corporation, although many of the business risks to which we are subject are similar to those that would be faced by a corporation engaged in the frac sand businesses.  You should consider carefully the following risk factors together with all of the other information included in this report in evaluating an investment in our common units.. If any of the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  In that case, we may be unable to make distributions on our common units, the trading price of our common units could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.. Risks Related to Our Business. We may not have sufficient available cash to pay any quarterly distribution on our common units.. We may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to enable us to pay any distributions to our unitholders.  For example, the board of directors of our general partner determined that we did not generate sufficient available cash to distribute to our unitholders for each quarter during the year ended December 31, 2017.  Our partnership agreement does not require us to pay distributions on a quarterly basis or otherwise.. In future periods, the amount of cash we can distribute principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which fluctuates from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:. • the level of production of, demand for, and price of frac sand, particularly in the markets we serve;. • the fees we charge, and the margins we realize, from our frac sand sales and the other services we provide;. • changes in laws and regulations (or the interpretation thereof) related to the mining and oil and natural gas industries, silica dust exposure or the environment;. • the level of competition from other companies;. • the cost and time required to execute organic growth opportunities;. • difficulty collecting receivables; and. • prevailing global and regional economic and regulatory conditions, and their impact on our suppliers and customers.. In addition, the actual amount of cash we have available for distribution depends on other factors, including:. • the levels of our maintenance capital expenditures and growth capital expenditures;. • the level of our operating costs and expenses;. • our debt service requirements and other liabilities;. • fluctuations in our working capital needs;. • restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility, the purchase agreement that governs our second lien notes and any other debt agreements to which we are a party;. • the cost of acquisitions, if any;. • fluctuations in interest rates;. • our ability to borrow funds and access capital markets; and. • the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner.. The amount of distributions that we pay, if any, and the decision to pay any distribution at all, are determined by the board of directors of our general partner.  Our revolving credit facility and the purchase agreement that governs our second lien notes also require us to comply with certain financial metrics and liquidity thresholds in order to make quarterly distributions to holders of our common units.  Our quarterly distributions, if any, are subject to significant fluctuations based on the above factors.. The amount of cash we have available for distribution to unitholders depends primarily on our cash flow and not solely on profitability.. You should be aware that the amount of cash we have available for distribution depends primarily upon our cash flow, including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings, and not solely on profitability, which is affected by non-cash items.  As a result, we may not be able to make cash distributions during periods in which we record net income.. 15. Table of Contents. The amount of our quarterly cash distributions, if any, may vary significantly both quarterly and annually and will be directly dependent on the performance of our business.  Unlike most publicly traded partnerships, we do not have a minimum quarterly distribution or employ structures intended to consistently maintain or increase distributions over time.. Investors who are looking for an investment that will pay regular and predictable quarterly distributions should not invest in our common units.  We expect our business performance may be more volatile, and our cash flows may be less stable, than the business performance and cash flows of most publicly traded partnerships.  As a result, our quarterly cash distributions may be volatile and may vary quarterly and annually.  Unlike most publicly traded partnerships, we do not have a minimum quarterly distribution or employ structures intended to consistently maintain or increase distributions over time.  The amount of our quarterly cash distributions is directly dependent on the performance of our business.  Because our quarterly distributions will significantly correlate to the cash we generate each quarter after payment of our fixed and variable expenses, quarterly distributions paid to our unitholders may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and may be zero.. The board of directors of our general partner may modify or revoke our cash distribution policy at any time at its discretion.  Our partnership agreement does not require us to make any distributions at all.. The board of directors of our general partner adopted a cash distribution policy pursuant to which we distribute all of the available cash we generate each quarter to unitholders of record on a pro rata basis.  However, the board may change such policy at any time at its discretion and could elect not to make distributions for one or more quarters.  For example, the board of directors of our general partner determined not to make a cash distribution on our common units for each quarter during the year ended December 31, 2017.  Our partnership agreement does not require us to make any distributions at all.  Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the permanence of such a policy in making an investment decision.  Any modification or revocation of our cash distribution policy could substantially reduce or eliminate the amounts of distributions to our unitholders.. We have a history of losses and may continue to incur losses in the future.. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we incurred aggregate losses of $6.8 million and $72.8 million, respectively.  Our loss from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $3.7 million and $113.2 million, respectively, and our loss from discontinued operations was $3.1 million  for the year ended December 31, 2017 and an income of $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.  There is no assurance that we will operate profitably or will generate positive cash flow in the future.  In addition, our operating results in the future may be subject to significant fluctuations due to many factors not within our control, such as the demand for our frac sand products, and the level of competition and general economic conditions.. Our operations are subject to the cyclical nature of our customers' businesses and depend upon the continued demand for crude oil and natural gas.. Our frac sand sales are to customers in the oil and natural gas industry, a historically cyclical industry.  This industry was adversely affected by the uncertain global economic climate in the second half of 2008 and in 2009.  Natural gas, crude oil and NGL prices declined significantly in the second half of 2014 and have been negatively affected by a combination of factors, including weakening demand, increased production, the decision by the OPEC to keep production levels unchanged and a strengthening in the U.S. dollar relative to most other currencies.  Further downward pressure on commodity prices continued throughout 2015 and the first nine months of 2016. Worldwide economic, political and military events, including war, terrorist activity, events in the Middle East and initiatives by OPEC have contributed, and are likely to continue to contribute, to commodity price volatility.  Additionally, warmer than normal winters in North America and other weather patterns may adversely impact the short-term demand for oil and natural gas and, therefore, demand for our products.. During periods of economic slowdown and long-term reductions in oil and natural gas prices, oil and natural gas exploration and production companies often reduce their oil and natural gas production rates and also reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects, which results in decreased demand for our frac sand.  Such developments occur even among companies that are not experiencing financial difficulties.  A continued or renewed economic downturn in one or more of the industries or geographic regions that we serve, or in the worldwide economy, could adversely affect our results of operations.  In addition, any future decreases in the rate at which oil and natural gas reserves are discovered or developed, whether due to increased governmental regulation, limitations on exploration and drilling activity, a sustained decline in oil and natural gas prices, or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, even in a stronger natural gas and oil price environment.. Our operations are subject to operating risks that are often beyond our control and could adversely affect production levels and costs.. Our mining, processing and production facilities are subject to risks normally encountered in the frac sand industry.  These risks include:. • changes in the price and availability of transportation;. 16. Table of Contents. • inability to obtain necessary production equipment or replacement parts;. • inclement or hazardous weather conditions, including flooding, and the physical impacts of climate change;. • unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressures;. • unanticipated ground, grade or water conditions;. • inability to acquire or maintain necessary permits or mining or water rights;. • labor disputes and disputes with our excavation contractors;. • late delivery of supplies;. • changes in the price and availability of natural gas or electricity that we use as fuel sources for our frac sand plants and equipment;. • technical difficulties or failures;. • cave-ins or similar pit wall failures;. • environmental hazards, such as unauthorized spills, releases and discharges of wastes, tank ruptures and emissions of unpermitted levels of pollutants;. • industrial accidents;. • changes in laws and regulations (or the interpretation thereof) related to the mining and oil and natural gas industries, silica dust exposure or the environment;. • inability of our customers or distribution partners to take delivery;. • reduction in the amount of water available for processing;. • fires, explosions or other accidents; and. • facility shutdowns in response to environmental regulatory actions.. Any of these risks could result in damage to, or destruction of, our mining properties or production facilities, personal injury, environmental damage, delays in mining or processing, losses or possible legal liability.  Any prolonged downtime or shutdowns at our mining properties or production facilities could have a material adverse effect on us.. Not all of these risks are reasonably insurable, and our insurance coverage contains limits, deductibles, exclusions and endorsements.  Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to meet our needs in the event of loss, and any such loss may have a material adverse effect on us.. We may be adversely affected by decreased demand for frac sand or the development of either effective alternative proppants or new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing.. Frac sand is a proppant used in the completion and re-completion of natural gas and oil wells through hydraulic fracturing.  Frac sand is the most commonly used proppant and is less expensive than ceramic proppant, which is also used in hydraulic fracturing to stimulate and maintain oil and natural gas production.  A significant shift in demand from frac sand to other proppants, such as ceramic proppants, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  The development and use of other effective alternative proppants, or the development of new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing altogether, could also cause a decline in demand for the frac sand we produce and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. We may be adversely affected by a reduction in horizontal drilling activity or the development of either effective alternative proppants or new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing.. Demand for frac sand is substantially higher in the case of horizontally drilled wells, which allow for multiple hydraulic fractures within the same well bore but are more expensive to develop than vertically drilled wells.  The development and use of a cheaper, more effective alternative proppant, a reduction in horizontal drilling activity or the development of new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing altogether, could also cause a decline in demand for the frac sand we produce and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  A reduction in demand for the frac sand we produce may cause our contractual arrangements to become economically unattractive and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. 17. Table of Contents. A large portion of our sales is generated by a few large customers, and the loss of our largest customers or a significant reduction in purchases by those customers could adversely affect our operations.. During 2017, our top five customers represented 59.1% of sales from our continuing operations.  Our customers who are not subject to firm contractual commitments may not continue to purchase the same levels of our products in the future due to a variety of reasons.  For example, some of our top customers could go out of business or, alternatively, be acquired by other companies that purchase the same products and services provided by us from other third-party providers.  Our customers could also seek to capture and develop their own sources of frac sand.  In addition, some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks.  If any of our major customers substantially reduces or altogether ceases purchasing our products, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects.  In addition, upon the expiration or termination of our existing contracts, we may not be able to enter into new contracts at all or on terms as favorable as our existing contracts.  We may also choose to renegotiate our existing contracts on less favorable terms (including with respect to price and volumes) in order to preserve relationships with our customers.. In addition, the long-term sales agreements we have for our frac sand may negatively impact our results of operations.  Certain of our long-term agreements are for sales at fixed prices that are adjusted only for certain cost increases.  As a result, in periods with increasing frac sand prices, our contract prices may be lower than prevailing industry spot prices.  Our long-term sales agreements also contain provisions that allow prices to be adjusted downwards in the event of falling industry prices.. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance by any of our key customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance by any of our key customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and cash flows and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.  Our long-term take-or-pay sales agreements with select customers contain provisions designed to compensate us, in part, for our lost margins on any unpurchased volumes; accordingly, in most circumstances, we would be paid less than the price per ton we would receive if our customers purchased the contractual tonnage amounts.  Certain of our other long-term frac sand sales agreements provide for minimum tonnage orders by our customers but do not contain pre-determined liquidated damage penalties in the event the customers fail to purchase designated volumes.  Instead, we would seek legal remedies against the non-performing customer or seek new customers to replace our lost sales volumes.  Certain of our other long-term frac sand supply contracts are efforts-based and therefore do not require the customer to purchase minimum volumes of frac sand from us or contain take-or-pay provisions.. Our different types of contracts with our frac sand customers provide for different potential remedies to us in the event a customer fails to purchase the minimum contracted amount of frac sand in a given period.  If we were to pursue legal remedies in the event a customer failed to purchase the minimum contracted amount of sand under a fixed-volume contract or failed to satisfy the take-or-pay commitment under a take-or-pay contract, we may receive significantly less in a judgment or settlement of any claimed breach than we would have received had the customer fully performed under the contract.  In the event of any customer's breach, we may also choose to renegotiate any disputed contract on less favorable terms (including with respect to price and volumes) to us to preserve the relationship with that customer.  Accordingly, any material nonpayment or performance by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and cash flows and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.. Our long-term contracts may preclude us from taking advantage of increasing prices for frac sand or mitigating the effect of increased operational costs during the term of our long-term contracts, even though certain volumes under our long-term contracts are subject to annual fixed price escalators.. The long-term supply contracts we have may negatively impact our results of operations in future periods.  Our long-term contracts require our customers to pay a specified price for a specified volume of frac sand over a specified period of time.  As a result, in periods with increasing prices, our sales may not keep pace with market prices.  Additionally, if our operational costs increase during the terms of our long-term supply contracts, we may not be able to pass any of those increased costs to our customers.  If we are unable to otherwise mitigate these increased operational costs, our net income and available cash for distributions could decline.. The credit risks of our concentrated customer base could result in losses.. This concentration of our customers in the energy industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as customers may be similarly affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions. If a significant number of our customers experience a prolonged business decline or disruption, we may incur increased exposure to credit risk and bad debts.  If we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers or unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness, any resulting increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by them and our inability to re-market or otherwise use the production could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.. 18. Table of Contents. Certain of our contracts contain provisions requiring us to meet minimum obligations to our customers and suppliers.  If we are unable to meet our minimum requirements under these contracts, we may be required to pay penalties or the contract counterparty may be able to terminate the agreement.. In certain instances, we commit to deliver products to our customers prior to production, under penalty of nonperformance.  Depending on the contract, our inability to deliver the requisite tonnage of frac sand may permit our customers to terminate the agreement or require us to pay our customers a fee, the amount of which would be based on the difference between the amounts of tonnage contracted for and the amount delivered.  We have significant long-term operating leases for railcars, both currently in service and yet to be delivered, under which we would still be obligated to pay despite any future decrease in the number of railcars needed to conduct our operations.  Further, our agreement with Canadian National requires us to provide minimum volumes of frac sand for shipping on the Canadian National line.  If we do not provide the minimum volume of frac sand for shipping, we will be required to pay a per-ton shortfall penalty, subject to certain exceptions.  In addition, under our agreements with sand suppliers, we are obligated to order a minimum amount of wet sand per year or pay fees on the difference between the minimum and the amount we actually order.  Similarly, we would be required to make minimum payments to mineral rights owners at certain of our mines in the event we purchase less than the minimum volumes of sand specified under the particular royalty agreement in place.  If we are unable to meet our obligations under any of these agreements, we may have to pay substantial penalties or the agreements may become subject to termination, as applicable.  In such events, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.. We must effectively manage our production capacity.. To meet rapidly changing demand in the frac sand industry, we must effectively manage our resources and production capacity.  During periods of decreasing demand for frac sand, we must be able to appropriately align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions and effectively manage our mining operations.  Our ability to rapidly and effectively reduce our cost structure in response to such downturns is limited by the fixed nature of many of our expenses in the near term and by our need to continue our investment in maintaining reserves and production capabilities.  Conversely, when upturns occur in the markets we serve, we may have difficulty rapidly and effectively increasing our production capacity or procuring sufficient reserves to meet any sudden increases in the demand for frac sand that could result in the loss of business to our competitors and harm our relationships with our customers.  The inability to timely and appropriately adapt to changes in our business environment could have a material adverse effect on our our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.. Failure to maintain effective quality control systems at our mining, processing and production facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.. The performance, quality, and safety of our products are critical to the success of our business.  For instance, our frac sand must meet stringent International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, and API technical specifications, including sphericity, grain size, crush resistance, acid solubility, purity, and turbidity, as well as customer specifications, in order to be suitable for hydraulic fracturing purposes.  If our frac sand fails to meet such specifications or our customers' expectations, we could be subject to significant contractual damages or contract terminations and face serious harm to our reputation, and our sales could be negatively affected.  The performance, quality, and safety of our products depend significantly on the effectiveness of our quality control systems, which, in turn, depends on a number of factors, including the design of our quality control systems, our quality-training program and our ability to ensure that our employees adhere to our quality control policies and guidelines.  Any significant failure or deterioration of our quality control systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.. Increasing costs or a lack of dependability or availability of transportation services or infrastructure could have an adverse effect on our ability to deliver our frac sand products at competitive prices.. Because of the relatively low cost of producing frac sand, transportation and handling costs tend to be a significant component of the total delivered cost of sales.  The bulk of our currently contracted sales involve our customers also contracting with truck and rail services to haul our frac sand to end users.  If there are increased costs under those contracts, and our customers are not able to pass those increases along to end users, our customers may find alternative providers.  We have provided fee-based transportation and logistics (including railcar procurement, freight management, and product storage) services for both our spot market and contract customers.  Should we fail to properly manage the customer's logistics needs under those instances where we have agreed to provide them, we may face increased costs, and our customers may choose to purchase sand from other suppliers.  Labor disputes, derailments, adverse weather conditions or other environmental events, tight railcar leasing markets and changes to rail freight systems could interrupt or limit available transportation services.  For example, harsh weather conditions and the continued surge in frac sand demand are currently straining railroad networks across the country and leading to service disruptions.  A significant increase in transportation service rates, a reduction in the dependability or availability of transportation services, prolonged rail service disruptions or relocation of our customers' businesses to areas that are not served by the rail systems accessible from our production facilities could impair our customers' ability to access our products and our ability to expand our markets or lead our. 19. Table of Contents. customers to seek alternative sources of frac sand, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. We face significant competition that may cause us to lose market share and reduce our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.. The frac sand industries are highly competitive.  The frac sand market is characterized by a small number of large, national producers and a larger number of small, regional, or local producers.  Competition in this industry is based on price, consistency and quality of product, site location, distribution capability, customer service, reliability of supply, breadth of product offering and technical support.. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do.  In addition, our larger competitors may develop technology superior to ours or may have production facilities that offer lower-cost transportation to certain specific customer locations than we do.  In recent years there has been an increase in the number of small, regional producers servicing the frac sand market due to an increased demand for hydraulic fracturing services and to the growing number of unconventional resource formations being developed in the United States.  Should the demand for hydraulic fracturing services decrease or the supply of frac sand available in the market increase, prices in the frac sand market could materially decrease as less-efficient producers exit the market, selling frac sand at below market prices.  Furthermore, oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and other providers of hydraulic fracturing services have acquired and in the future may acquire their own frac sand reserves to fulfill their proppant requirements, and these other market participants may expand their existing frac sand production capacity, all of which would negatively impact demand for our frac sand products.  In addition, increased competition in the frac sand industry could have an adverse impact on our ability to enter into long-term contracts or to enter into contracts on favorable terms.. Our cash flows fluctuate on a seasonal basis and severe weather conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business.. Because raw sand cannot be wet-processed during extremely cold temperatures, frac sand is typically washed only eight months out of the year at our Wisconsin operations.  Our inability to wash frac sand year round in Wisconsin results in a seasonal build-up of inventory as we excavate excess sand to build a stockpile that will feed the dry plant during the winter months.  This seasonal build-up of inventory causes our average inventory balance to fluctuate from a few weeks in early spring to more than 100 days in early winter.  As a result, the cash flows of our continuing sand operations fluctuate on a seasonal basis based on the length of time Wisconsin wet plant operations must remain shut down due to harsh winter weather conditions.  We may also be selling frac sand for use in oil and gas-producing basins where severe weather conditions may curtail drilling activities and, as a result, our sales volumes to customers in those areas may be adversely affected.  For example, we could experience a decline in volumes sold for the second quarter relative to the first quarter each year due to seasonality of frac sand sales to customers in western Canada as sales volumes are generally lower during the months of April and May due to limited drilling activity as a result of that region's annual thaw.  Unexpected winter conditions (if winter comes earlier than expected or lasts longer than expected) may lead to us not having a sufficient sand stockpile to supply feedstock for our dry plant during winter months and result in us being unable to meet our contracted sand deliveries during such time, or may drive frac sand sales volumes down by affecting drilling activity among our customers, each of which could lead to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and reputation.  The inability of our logistics partners, including rail companies, to manage their own operations efficiently during inclement weather could have an effect on our ability to serve our customers where we are relying on our logistics partners to provide certain transportation services.. Diminished access to water may adversely affect our operations and the operations of our customers.. While much of our process water is recycled and recirculated, the mining and processing activities in which we engage at our wet plant facilities require significant amounts of water.  During extreme drought conditions, some of our facilities are located in areas that can become water-constrained.  We have obtained water rights and have installed high capacity wells on our properties that we currently use to service the activities on our properties, and we plan to obtain all required water rights to service other properties we may develop or acquire in the future.  However, the amount of water that we are entitled to use pursuant to our water rights must be determined by the appropriate regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate.  Such regulatory authorities may amend the regulations regarding such water rights, increase the cost of maintaining such water rights or eliminate our current water rights, and we may be unable to retain all or a portion of such water rights.  Such changes in laws, regulations or government policy and related interpretations pertaining to water rights may alter the environment in which we do business, which may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.. Similarly, our customers' performance of hydraulic fracturing activities may require the use of large amounts of water.  The ability of our customers' to obtain the necessary amounts of water sufficient to perform hydraulic fracturing activities may well depend on those customers ability to acquire water by means of contract, permitting, or spot purchase.  The ability of our customers to obtain and maintain sufficient levels of water for these fracturing activities are similarly subject to regulatory authority approvals, changes in applicable laws or regulations, potentially differing interpretations of contract terms, increases in costs to provide such water, and even changes in weather that could make such water resources more scarce.. 20. Table of Contents. We may be unable to grow our cash flows if we are unable to expand our business, which could limit our ability to increase distributions to our unitholders.. A principal focus of our strategy is to continue to grow the per unit distribution on our units by expanding our businesses, particularly our frac sand business.  Our future growth will depend upon a number of factors, some of which we cannot control.  These factors include our ability to:. • develop new business and enter into contracts with new customers;. • retain our existing customers and maintain or expand the level of services we provide them;. • identify and obtain additional frac sand reserves;. • recruit and train qualified personnel and retain valued employees;. • expand our geographic presence;. • effectively manage our costs and expenses, including costs and expenses related to growth;. • consummate accretive acquisitions;. • obtain required debt or equity financing for our existing and new operations;. • meet customer-specific contract requirements or pre-qualifications;. • obtain permits from federal, state and local regulatory authorities; and. • make assumptions about mineral reserves, future production, sales, capital expenditures, operating expenses and costs, including synergies.. If we do not achieve levels of growth expected for our business, the market price of our common units could decline materially.. We may be unable to grow successfully through future acquisitions, and we may not be able to integrate effectively the businesses we may acquire, which may impact our operations and limit our ability to increase distributions to our unitholders.. From time to time, we may choose to make business acquisitions to pursue market opportunities, increase our existing capabilities, and expand into new areas of operations.  While we have reviewed acquisition opportunities in the past and will continue to do so in the future, we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities or successfully acquire identified targets.  In addition, we may not be successful in integrating any future acquisitions into our existing operations, which may result in unforeseen operational difficulties or diminished financial performance or require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention.  Even if we are successful in integrating future acquisitions into our existing operations, we may not derive the benefits, such as operational or administrative synergies, that we expected from such acquisitions, which may result in the commitment of our capital resources without the expected returns on such capital.  Furthermore, competition for acquisition opportunities may escalate, increasing our cost of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making acquisitions.  Our inability to make acquisitions, or to integrate successfully future acquisitions into our existing operations, may adversely impact our operations and limit our ability to increase distributions to our unitholders.. Growing our business by constructing new plants and facilities subjects us to construction risks as well as market risks relating to insufficient demand for the services of such plants and facilities upon completion thereof.. One of the ways we intend to grow our business is through the construction of new dry plants, wet plants, and transload facilities in our continuing sand operations.  The construction of such facilities requires the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, which may exceed our resources, and involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political, and legal uncertainties.  If we undertake these projects, we may not be able to complete them on schedule or at all or at the budgeted cost.  Moreover, our revenues may not increase upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project.  For instance, if we build a new plant or facility, the construction will occur over an extended period of time, and we will not receive any material increases in revenues until at least after completion of the project, if at all.  Moreover, we may construct new plants or facilities to capture anticipated future demand in a region in which anticipated market conditions do not materialize or for which we are unable to acquire new customers.  As a result, new plants or facilities may not be able to attract enough demand to achieve our expected investment return, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.. Our ability to grow in the future is dependent on our ability to access external growth capital.. We may distribute all of our available cash after expenses and prudent operating reserves to our unitholders.  We expect that we will rely primarily upon external financing sources, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to maintain our asset base and fund growth capital expenditures.  However, we may not be able to obtain. 21. Table of Contents. equity or debt financing on terms favorable to us, or at all.  To the extent we are unable to efficiently finance growth externally, our cash distribution policy will significantly impair our ability to grow.  In addition, because we may distribute all of our available cash, we may not grow as quickly as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations.  To the extent we issue additional units in connection with other growth capital expenditures, such issuances may result in significant dilution to our existing unitholders and the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level.  There are no limitations in our partnership agreement on our ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units.  The incurrence of borrowings or other debt by us to finance our growth strategy would result in interest expense, which in turn would affect the available cash that we have to distribute to our unitholders.. Our debt levels may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing, pursuing other business opportunities and paying distributions.. In January 2018, we entered into a $75.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility with outstanding borrowings of $2.5 million as of February 22, 2018, as well as $215.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes currently outstanding under our second lien note purchase agreement.  As of January 31, 2018, our borrowing base under the revolving credit facility was in excess of $75 million, and therefore available borrowings are limited by total commitments from lenders.  Our ability to incur additional debt is subject to limitations under our revolving credit facility and the purchase agreement that governs our second lien notes.  Our level of debt has important consequences to us, including the following:. • our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for operating working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired by our debt level, or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;. • we need a portion of our cash flow to make payments on our indebtedness, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions; and. • our debt level makes us more vulnerable than our competitors with less debt to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally.. Our ability to service our debt depends upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which is affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.  In addition, our ability to service our debt under our revolving credit facility and the purchase agreement that governs our second lien notes depends on market interest rates, since the interest rates applicable to our borrowings fluctuate with movements in interest rate markets.  If our operating results are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt, or seeking additional equity capital.  We may be unable to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms, or at all.. Restrictions in our revolving credit facility and the purchase agreement that governs our second lien notes limit our ability to capitalize on acquisition and other business opportunities.. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our revolving credit facility, the purchase agreement that governs our second lien notes and any future financing agreements could restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue our business activities.  For example, our revolving credit facility and the purchase agreement that governs our second lien notes restrict or limit our ability to:. • grant liens;. • incur additional indebtedness;. • engage in a merger, consolidation or dissolution;. • enter into transactions with affiliates;. • sell or otherwise dispose of assets, businesses and operations;. • materially alter the character of our business;. • make acquisitions, investments and capital expenditures; and. • make distributions to our unitholders.. Furthermore, our revolving credit facility and the purchase agreement that governs our second lien notes contain certain operating and financial covenants.  Our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and the purchase agreement that governs our second lien notes may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions.  If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired.  If we violate any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests a significant portion of our indebtedness. 22. Table of Contents. may become immediately due and payable.  We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.  Any subsequent replacement of our revolving credit facility, our second lien notes or any new indebtedness could have similar or greater restrictions.. We may have difficulty maintaining compliance with the covenants and ratios required under our revolving credit facility and the purchase agreement that governs our second lien notes, which currently include covenants to maintain certain levels of liquidity and meet certain threshold ratios for leverage and fixed charges.  Failure to maintain compliance with these financial covenants could adversely affect our operations, financial condition and ability to make distributions to our unitholders.. We depend on our revolving credit facility for future capital needs and to fund our operations and capital expenditures, as necessary.  We are required to comply with certain financial covenants and ratios under our revolving credit facility as well as the purchase agreement that governs our second lien notes.  Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and events or circumstances beyond our control, including events and circumstances that may stem from the condition of financial markets and commodity price levels.  Our revolving credit facility and the purchase agreement that governs our second lien notes require us, among other things, to maintain a minimum liquidity requirement of $20 million at all times, to meet certain thresholds for total leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio and to limit our capital expenditures, subject to certain availability thresholds.  We are currently in compliance with the covenants in our revolving credit facility and the purchase agreement that governs our second lien notes.. Our failure to comply with any of the covenants in our revolving credit facility and the purchase agreement that governs our second lien notes could result in a default, which could cause all of our existing indebtedness to become immediately due and payable.  In the event that we are unable to access sufficient capital to fund our business and planned capital expenditures, we may be required to curtail our acquisitions, strategic growth projects, portions of our current operations and other activities.  A lack of capital could result in a decrease in the operations of our sand business, subject us to claims of breach under customer and supplier contracts and may force us to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis, each of which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and ability to make distributions to our unitholders.. If we are unable to generate enough cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness or are unable to use future borrowings to refinance our indebtedness or fund other capital needs, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, which may have onerous terms or may be unavailable.. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our outstanding indebtedness, or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other capital needs.  If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as:. • refinancing or restructuring all or a portion of our debt;. • obtaining alternative financing;. • selling assets;. • reducing or delaying capital investments;. • seeking to raise additional capital; or. • revising or delaying our strategic plans.. However, we cannot assure you that we would be able to implement alternative financing plans, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that undertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, would allow us to meet our debt obligations and capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments.. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to obtain alternative financing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects.  Any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms.  Further, if for any reason we are unable to meet our debt service and repayment obligations, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing our debt, which would allow our creditors at that time to declare all outstanding indebtedness to be due and payable (which would in turn trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default rights between the relevant agreements), the lenders under our revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to lend any additional amounts, and the lenders under our revolving credit facility and the purchase agreement that governs our second lien notes could foreclose against our assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility, the purchase agreement that governs our second lien notes or any of our other indebtedness were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the lenders or to our other debt holders.. 23. Table of Contents. Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt.  This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our current indebtedness.. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to certain limitations, including those under our revolving credit facility and the purchase agreement that governs our second lien notes.  If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could increase.  Our level of indebtedness could, for instance, prevent us from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us or from making desirable capital expenditures.  This could put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other less leveraged competitors that have more cash flow to devote to their operations.  In addition, the incurrence of additional indebtedness could make it more difficult to satisfy our existing financial obligations.. Our ability to manage and grow our business effectively may be adversely affected if we lose management or operational personnel.. We depend on the continuing efforts of our executive officers.  The departure of any of our executive officers could have a significant negative effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace.. Additionally, our ability to hire, train and retain qualified personnel will continue to be important and will become more challenging as we grow and if energy industry market conditions continue to be positive.  When general industry conditions are good, the competition for experienced operational personnel increases as other energy and manufacturing companies' personnel needs increase.  Our ability to grow or even to continue our current level of service to our current customers will be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully hire, train and retain these important personnel.. Inaccuracies in our estimates of mineral reserves could result in lower than expected sales and higher than expected costs.. We base our mineral reserve estimates on engineering, economic, and geological data assembled and analyzed by our engineers and geologists, which are reviewed by outside firms.  However, sand reserve estimates are necessarily imprecise and depend to some extent on statistical inferences drawn from available drilling data, which may prove unreliable.  There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of mineral reserves and in estimating costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control.  Estimates of recoverable mineral reserves necessarily depend on a number of factors and assumptions, all of which may vary considerably from actual results, such as:. • geological and mining conditions and/or effects from prior mining that may not be fully identified by available data or that may differ from experience;. • assumptions concerning future prices of frac sand products, operating costs, mining technology improvements, development costs and reclamation costs; and. • assumptions concerning future effects of regulation, including our ability to obtain required permits and the imposition of taxes by governmental agencies.. Any inaccuracy in our estimates related to our mineral reserves could result in lower than expected sales and higher than expected costs and have an adverse effect on our cash available for distribution.. Our operations are dependent on our rights and ability to mine our properties and on our having renewed or received the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities and other third parties.. We hold numerous governmental, environmental, mining, and other permits, water rights and approvals authorizing operations at each of our sand facilities.  A decision by a governmental agency or other third party to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit, water right or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit, water right or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility.  Expansion of our existing operations is also predicated on securing the necessary environmental or other permits, water rights or approvals, which we may not receive in a timely manner or at all.. We are subject to compliance with stringent environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to substantial costs and liabilities.. Our sand and mining operations are subject to increasingly stringent and complex federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and standards governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection.  These laws, regulations and standards impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our operations, including the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities; the incurrence of significant capital expenditures to limit or prevent releases of materials from our processors, terminals, and related facilities; and the imposition of remedial actions or other liabilities for pollution conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations.  Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA, and similar state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws, regulations and standards and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly actions.. 24. Table of Contents. Failure to comply with environmental laws, regulations, standards, permits, and orders may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations.  Certain environmental laws impose strict liability for the remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances that could subject us to liability without regard to whether we were negligent or at fault.  In addition, changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any such changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements with respect to our operations or more stringent or costly well drilling, construction, completion or water management activities with respect to our customers' operations could adversely affect our operations, financial results and cash available for distribution.. Increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, unanticipated remediation obligations or emissions control expenditures and claims for penalties or damages could result in substantial costs and liabilities, and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders could suffer as a result.  Neither the owners of our general partner nor their affiliates will indemnify us for any environmental liabilities, including those arising from non-compliance or pollution, that may be discovered at, on or under, or arise from, our operations or assets.  As such, we can expect no economic assistance from any of them in the event that we are required to make expenditures to investigate, correct or remediate any petroleum hydrocarbons, hazardous substances, wastes or other materials.  Please see \"Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations\" for more detail regarding the environmental and occupational health and safety rules that impact our operations.. Government action on climate change could result in increased compliance costs for us and our customers.. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of natural gas, are examples of greenhouse gases (\"GHGs\").  In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs.  It presently appears unlikely that comprehensive climate legislation will be passed by either house of Congress in the near future, although energy legislation and other regulatory initiatives are expected to be proposed that may be relevant to GHG emissions issues.  In addition, almost half of the states have begun to address GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional GHG cap and trade programs.  Depending on the particular program, we could be required to control GHG emissions or to purchase and surrender allowances for GHG emissions resulting from our operations.. Independent of Congress, the EPA has adopted regulations controlling GHG emissions under its existing authority under the CAA. For example, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions in the United States from specified large GHG emission sources.  The EPA also has adopted rules establishing construction and operating permit requirements for certain large stationary sources of GHG emissions that are already potential major sources of critical pollutants.. Although it is not currently possible to predict how any such proposed or future GHG legislation or regulation by Congress, the EPA, the states or multi-state regions will impact our business, any legislation or regulation of GHG emissions that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions or reduced demand for our services, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Further, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.  The agreement entered into force in November 2016 after more than 70 countries, including the United States, ratified or otherwise consented to be bound by the agreement.  To the extent the United States or any other country implements this agreement or impose other climate change regulations on the oil and gas industry, it could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business.. Mine closures entail substantial costs, and if we close one or more of our mines sooner than anticipated, our results of operations may be adversely affected.. We base our assumptions regarding the life of our mines on detailed studies that we perform from time to time, but our studies and assumptions do not always prove to be accurate.  If we close any of our mines sooner than expected, sales will decline unless we are able to increase production at any of our other mines, which may not be possible.. Applicable statutes and regulations require that mining property be reclaimed following a mine closure in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan.  The plan addresses matters such as decommissioning and removal of facilities and equipment, re-grading, prevention of erosion and other forms of water pollution, re-vegetation and post-mining monitoring and land use.  We may be required to post a surety bond or other form of financial assurance equal to the cost of reclamation as set forth in the approved reclamation plan.  The establishment of the final mine closure reclamation liability is based on permit requirements and requires various estimates and assumptions, principally associated with reclamation costs and production levels.  If our accruals for expected reclamation and other costs associated with mine closures for which we will be responsible were later determined to be insufficient, or if we were required to expedite the timing for performance of mine closure activities as compared to estimated timelines, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.. 25. Table of Contents. Federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and the potential for related regulatory action or litigation could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays for our customers, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.. A significant portion of our business supplies frac sand to oil and natural gas industry customers performing hydraulic fracturing activities.  Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing may adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into the formation to stimulate gas production.  Legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act (the \"SDWA\") to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of \"underground injection\" and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, were proposed in recent sessions of Congress.  We cannot predict whether any such legislation will ever be enacted and, if so, what its provisions would be.  Scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways, with the EPA having released a final report regarding the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources in 2016.  The report concluded that certain activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances.  In addition, the U.S. Department of energy released a series of recommendations for improving the safety of the process in 2011.  Further, the EPA and the U.S. Department of the Interior (the \"DOI\") have proposed and adopted new regulations for certain aspects of the process.  For example, the EPA finalized effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing.  The DOI adopted rules that require disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing activities upon federal and Indian lands and also would strengthen standards for well-bore integrity and the management of fluids that return to the surface during and after fracturing operations on federal and Indian lands (although implementation of this rule has been stayed pending the resolution of legal challenges).. In addition, various state, local and foreign governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permitting requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain areas, such as environmentally sensitive watersheds.  For example, many states - including the major oil and gas producing states of North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West Virginia - have imposed disclosure requirements on hydraulic fracturing well owners and operators.  The availability of public information regarding the constituents of hydraulic fracturing fluids could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate individual or class action legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater and drinking water supplies or otherwise cause harm to human health or the environment.  Moreover, disclosure to third parties or to the public, even if inadvertent, of our customers' proprietary chemical formulas could diminish the value of those formulas and result in competitive harm to our customers, which could indirectly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The adoption of new laws or regulations at the federal, state, local or foreign levels imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting or delaying, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete natural gas wells in shale formations, increase our customers' costs of compliance and doing business and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they perform, which could negatively impact demand for our frac sand products.  In addition, heightened political, regulatory, and public scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing practices could potentially expose us or our customers to increased legal and regulatory proceedings, and any such proceedings could be time-consuming, costly or result in substantial legal liability or significant reputational harm.  Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, whether directly or indirectly.  For example, we could be directly affected by adverse litigation involving us, or indirectly affected if the cost of compliance limits the ability of our customers to operate in the geographic areas we serve.. We are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, which imposes stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of our operations.. Our operations are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, which imposes stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of mineral extraction and processing operations, including the training of personnel, operating procedures and operating equipment.  We are also subject to standards imposed by MSHA and other federal and state agencies relating to workplace exposure to crystalline silica.  Our failure to comply with such standards, or changes in such standards or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition or otherwise impose significant restrictions on our ability to conduct mineral extraction and processing operations.. 26. Table of Contents. We and our customers are subject to other extensive regulations, including licensing, protection of plant and wildlife endangered and threatened species, and reclamation regulation, that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities.  In addition, future regulations, or more stringent enforcement of existing regulations, could increase those costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.. In addition to the regulatory matters described above, we and our customers are subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife threatened and endangered species protection, jurisdictional wetlands protection, reclamation and restoration activities at mining properties after mining is completed, the discharge of materials into the environment and the effects that mining and hydraulic fracturing have on groundwater quality and availability.  Our future success depends, among other things, on the quantity of our frac sand and other mineral deposits and our ability to extract these deposits profitably, and our customers being able to operate their businesses as they currently do.. In order to obtain permits and renewals of permits in the future, we may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the potential adverse impact that any proposed mining and processing activities may have on the environment, individually or in the aggregate, including on public lands.  Certain approval procedures may require preparation of archaeological surveys, endangered species studies and other studies to assess the environmental impact of new sites or the expansion of existing sites.  Compliance with these regulatory requirements is expensive and significantly lengthens the time needed to develop a site.  Finally, obtaining or renewing required permits is sometimes delayed or prevented due to community opposition and other factors beyond our control.  The denial of a permit essential to our operations or the imposition of conditions with which it is not practicable or feasible to comply could impair or prevent our ability to develop or expand a site.  Significant opposition to a permit by neighboring property owners, members of the public or non-governmental organizations, or other third parties or delay in the environmental review and permitting process also could impair or delay our ability to develop or expand a site.  New legal requirements, including those related to the protection of the environment, could be adopted that could materially adversely affect our mining operations (including our ability to extract or the pace of extraction of mineral deposits), our cost structure or our customers' ability to use our frac sand products.  Such current or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and we may not be able to obtain or renew permits in the future.. Terrorist attacks, the threat of terrorist attacks, hostilities in the Middle East, or other sustained military campaigns may adversely impact our results of operations.. The long-term impact of terrorist attacks, such as the attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, and the magnitude of the threat of future terrorist attacks on the energy industry in general and on us in particular are not known at this time.  Uncertainty surrounding hostilities in the Middle East or other sustained military campaigns may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of markets for frac sand and the possibility that infrastructure facilities and pipelines could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror.  Changes in the insurance markets attributable to terrorist attacks may make certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain.  Moreover, the insurance that may be available to us may be significantly more expensive than our existing insurance coverage.  Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war could also affect our ability to raise capital.. A failure in our operational and communications systems, loss of power, natural disasters, or cyber security attacks on any of our facilities, or those of third-parties, may adversely affect our financial results.. Our business is dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and a substantial number of transactions. If any of our financial, operational or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our financial results could also be adversely affected if an employee causes our operational or financial systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our operational systems. In addition, dependence upon automated systems may further increase the risk that operational system flaws, employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.. Due to technology advances, we have become more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our business. We use computer programs to help run our financial and operations processes, and this may subject our business to increased risks. Any future cyber security attacks that affect our facilities, communications systems, our customers or any of our financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, cyber-attacks on our customer and employee data may result in a financial loss and may negatively impact our reputation. We do not maintain specialized insurance for possible liability resulting from a cyber-attack on our assets that may shut down all or part of our business. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer operational system failure. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business, result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial results.. 27. Table of Contents. Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us. Holders of our common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our general partner or its directors.. Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management's decisions regarding our business.  Unitholders have no right on an annual or ongoing basis to elect our general partner or its board of directors.  Insight Equity is the majority owner of our general partner and has the right to appoint our general partner's entire board of directors, including our independent directors.  If the unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they have little ability to remove our general partner.  As a result of these limitations, the price at which the common units trade may be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price.  Our partnership agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders' ability to influence the manner or direction of management.. Insight Equity owns the majority of and controls our general partner, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations.  Our general partner and its affiliates, including Insight Equity, have conflicts of interest with us and limited duties, and they may favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our common unitholders.. Insight Equity owns the majority of and controls our general partner and appoints all of the officers and directors of our general partner, some of whom are officers and directors of Insight Equity.  Although our general partner has a duty to manage us in a manner that is beneficial to us and our unitholders, the directors and officers of our general partner have a fiduciary duty to manage our general partner in a manner that is beneficial to its owners.  Conflicts of interest may arise between Insight Equity and our general partner, on the one hand, and us and our unitholders, on the other hand.  In resolving these conflicts of interest, our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of Insight Equity and the other owners of our general partner over our interests and the interests of our common unitholders.  These conflicts include the following situations, among others:. • neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires Insight Equity to pursue a business strategy that favors us or utilizes our assets or dictates what markets to pursue or grow;. • our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us, such as Insight Equity, in resolving conflicts of interest;. • our partnership agreement replaces the fiduciary duties that would otherwise be owed by our general partner with contractual standards governing its duties, limits our general partner's liabilities and restricts the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that, without these limitations, might constitute breaches of its fiduciary duty;. • our partnership agreement provides that whenever our general partner makes a determination or takes, or declines to take, any other action in its capacity as our general partner, our general partner is required to make such determination, or take or decline to take such other action, in good faith, meaning that it subjectively believed that the decision was in the best interests of our partnership, and, except as specifically provided by our partnership agreement, will not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by our partnership agreement, Delaware law, or any other law, rule or regulation, or at equity;. • except in limited circumstances, our general partner has the power and authority to conduct our business without unitholder approval;. • our general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, capital expenditures, borrowings, issuances of additional partnership securities and the creation, reduction or increase of reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders;. • our general partner determines which of the costs it incurs on our behalf are reimbursable by us;. • our partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered to us or from entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf;. • our general partner intends to limit its liability regarding our obligations;. • our general partner may exercise its right to call and purchase all of the common units not owned by it and its affiliates if they own more than 80% of the common units;. • our general partner controls the enforcement of its and its affiliates' obligations to us; and. • our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us.. 28. Table of Contents. Our general partner limits its liability regarding our obligations.. Our general partner limits its liability under contractual arrangements so that the counterparties to such arrangements have recourse only against our assets, and not against our general partner or its assets.  Our general partner may therefore cause us to incur indebtedness or other obligations that are nonrecourse to our general partner.  Our partnership agreement provides that any action taken by our general partner to limit its liability is not a breach of our general partner's duties, even if we could have obtained more favorable terms without the limitation on liability.  In addition, we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify our general partner to the extent that it incurs obligations on our behalf.  Any such reimbursement or indemnification payments would reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders.. Our partnership agreement replaces our general partner's fiduciary duties to holders of our common units with contractual standards governing its duties.. Our partnership agreement contains provisions that eliminate the fiduciary standards to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law and replace those duties with several different contractual standards.  For example, our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner, free of any duties to us and our unitholders other than the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which means that a court will enforce the reasonable expectations of the partners where the language in the partnership agreement does not provide for a clear course of action.  This provision entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires and relieves it of any duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or our limited partners.  Examples of decisions that our general partner may make in its individual capacity include:. • how to allocate business opportunities among us and its affiliates;. • whether to exercise its limited call right;. • whether to seek approval of the resolution of a conflict of interest by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner;. • how to exercise its voting rights with respect to the units it owns; and. • whether or not to consent to any merger or consolidation of the partnership or amendment to the partnership agreement.. Our common unitholders have agreed to become bound by the provisions in the partnership agreement, including the provisions discussed above.. Our partnership agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of our common units for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.. Our partnership agreement contains provisions that restrict the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty under state fiduciary duty law.  For example, our partnership agreement:. • provides that whenever our general partner makes a determination or takes, or declines to take, any other action in its capacity as our general partner, our general partner is required to make such determination, or take or decline to take such other action, in good faith, meaning it subjectively believed that the decision was in the best interest of our partnership, and except as specifically provided by our partnership agreement, will not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by our partnership agreement, Delaware law, or any other law, rule or regulation, or at equity;. • provides that our general partner will not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as a general partner so long as such decisions are made in good faith;. • provides that our general partner and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us, our limited partners or their assignees resulting from any act or omission unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that our general partner or its officers and directors, as the case may be, acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the conduct was unlawful; and. • provides that our general partner will not be in breach of its obligations under our partnership agreement (including any duties to us or our unitholders) if a transaction with an affiliate or the resolution of a conflict of interest is:. • approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner, although our general partner is not obligated to seek such approval;. • approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding common units, excluding any common units owned by our general partner or any of its affiliates;. 29. Table of Contents. • determined by the board of directors of our general partner to be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties; or. • determined by the board of directors of our general partner to be \"fair and reasonable\" to us, taking into account the totality of the relationships among the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us.. In connection with a situation involving a transaction with an affiliate or a conflict of interest, any determination by our general partner must be made in good faith.  If an affiliate transaction or the resolution of a conflict of interest is not approved by our common unitholders or the conflicts committee and the board of directors of our general partner determines that the resolution or course of action taken with respect to the affiliate transaction or conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in bullets three and four above, then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, the board of directors acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or the partnership, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption.  In this context, members of the board of directors of our general partner will be conclusively deemed to have acted in good faith if it subjectively believed that either of the standards set forth in bullets three and four above was satisfied.. Our partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20% or more of our common units.. Unitholders' voting rights are further restricted by a provision of our partnership agreement providing that any units held by a person that owns 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding, other than our general partner, its affiliates, their direct transferees and their indirect transferees approved by our general partner (which approval may be granted in its sole discretion) and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of our general partner, cannot vote on any matter.. Our general partner interest or the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.. Our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of the unitholders.  Furthermore, our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of Insight Equity to transfer all or a portion of its ownership interest in our general partner to a third party.  The new owner of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of our general partner with its own designees and thereby exert significant control over the decisions made by the board of directors and officers.. An increase in interest rates may cause the market price of our common units to decline.. Like all equity investments, an investment in our common units is subject to certain risks.  In exchange for accepting these risks, investors may expect to receive a higher rate of return than would otherwise be obtainable from lower-risk investments.  Accordingly, as interest rates rise, the ability of investors to obtain higher risk-adjusted rates of return by purchasing government-backed debt securities may cause a corresponding decline in demand for riskier investments generally, including yield-based equity investments such as publicly traded partnership interests.  Reduced demand for our common units resulting from investors seeking other more favorable investment opportunities may cause the trading price of our common units to decline.. We may issue additional units without your approval, which would dilute your existing ownership interests.. Our partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional limited partner interests that we may issue at any time without the approval of our unitholders.  The issuance by us of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:. • our existing unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;. • the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease;. • the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase;. • the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and. • the market price of the common units may decline.. Our general partner has a call right that may require you to sell your units at an undesirable time or price.. If at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units, our general partner will have the right, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, but not the obligation, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price that is not less than their then-current market price, as calculated pursuant to the terms of our partnership agreement.  As a result, you may be required to sell your common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return or a negative return on your investment.  You may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of your units.. 30. Table of Contents. Your liability may not be limited if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of our business.. A general partner of a partnership generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership, except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner.  Our partnership is organized under Delaware law, and we conduct business in a number of other states.  The limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some of the other states in which we do business.  You could be liable for any and all of our obligations as if you were a general partner if a court or government agency were to determine that:. • we were conducting business in a state but had not complied with that particular state's partnership statute; or. • your right to act with other unitholders to remove or replace our general partner, to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or to take other actions under our partnership agreement constitute \"control\" of our business.. Unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them.. Under certain circumstances, unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them.  Under Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, we may not make a distribution to you if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets.  Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of an impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount.  Substituted limited partners are liable both for the obligations of the assignor to make contributions to the partnership that were known to the substituted limited partner at the time it became a limited partner and for those obligations that were unknown if the liabilities could have been determined from the partnership agreement.  Neither liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interest nor liabilities that are non-recourse to the partnership are counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted.. The New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, does not require a publicly traded partnership like us to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements.. Because we are a publicly traded partnership, the NYSE does not require us to have a majority of independent directors on our general partner's board of directors or to establish a compensation committee or a nominating and corporate governance committee.  Accordingly, unitholders do not have the same protections afforded to certain corporations that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.. If we cannot meet the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") continued listing requirements, the NYSE may delist our common units which would have an adverse impact on the liquidity and market price of our common units.. Our common stock is currently listed on the NYSE. In the future, we may not be able to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE.  As previously disclosed in our press release dated May 20, 2016, and our Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 11, 2016, we were not able to file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016, in a timely manner.  On May 17, 2016, we received a letter from the New York Stock Exchange Regulation, Inc. informing us that, as a result of our failure to timely file our Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016, we were subject to the procedures specified in Section 802.01E (SEC Annual Report Timely Filing Criteria) of the NYSE's Listed Company Manual.  We are in compliance with this NYSE requirement following the filing of our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2016, and June 30, 2016, on September 12, 2016.  In addition, the continued listing requirements on the NYSE require, among other things; (i) that the average closing price of our common units be above $1.00 over 30 consecutive trading days and (ii) that our market capitalization be not less than $15 million over 30 consecutive trading days.  If in the future we are unable to satisfy the NYSE criteria for continued listing, our common units would be subject to delisting.  A delisting of our common units could negatively impact us by reducing the liquidity and market price of our common units, reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common units, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing.. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.  As a result, current and potential unitholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our units.. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud, and operate successfully as a public company.  If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed.  We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or that we will be able to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.  Any failure to maintain effective internal controls, or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving our internal controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.  Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our units.. 31. Table of Contents. Tax Risks to Common Unitholders. Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.  If the IRS were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, which would subject us to entity-level taxation, then our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced.. The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in the common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.  Despite the fact that we are a limited partnership under Delaware law, it is possible in certain circumstances for a partnership such as ours to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.  Although we do not believe based upon our current operations that we will be so treated, a change in our business or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity.. If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 21%, and would likely pay state and local income tax at varying rates.  Distributions would generally be taxed again as corporate dividends (to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits), and no income, gains, losses, deductions, or credits would flow through to you.  Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to you would be substantially reduced.  Therefore, if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, there would be a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units.. If we were subjected to a material amount of additional entity-level taxation by individual states, it would reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.. Changes in current state law may subject us to additional entity-level taxation by individual states.  Several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation.  Imposition of any such taxes may substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to you and, therefore, negatively impact the value of and investment in our common units.. The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.. The present federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative, or judicial interpretation at any time.  For example, from time to time, the U.S. government considers substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships, including the elimination of the qualifying income exception upon which we rely for our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.. Any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be retroactively applied and could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the exception for us to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.  We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted.  However, it is possible that a change in law could affect us, and any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units.. Our unitholders' share of our income is taxable to them for federal income tax purposes even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us.. Because a unitholder is treated as a partner to whom we allocate taxable income which could be different in amount than the cash we distribute, a unitholder's allocable share of our taxable income is taxable to it, which may require the payment of federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes, on its share of our taxable income even if it receives no cash distributions from us.  For example, a gain on the sale of any of our assets may result in a unitholder being allocated taxable income without receiving a corresponding cash distribution from us. Our unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income.. If the IRS contests the federal income tax positions we take, the market for our common units may be adversely impacted and the cost of any IRS contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.. The IRS has made no determination with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.  The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the positions we take, and the IRS's positions may ultimately be sustained.  It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take and such positions may not ultimately be sustained.  A court may not agree with some or all the positions we take.  Any contest with the IRS, and the outcome of any IRS contest, may have a materially adverse impact on the market for our common units and the price at which they trade.  In addition, our costs of any contest with the IRS will be borne indirectly by our unitholders because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution.. 32. Table of Contents. If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, it may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from us, in which case our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced.. Pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns, it may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from us.  Generally, we expect to elect to have our general partner and our unitholders take such audit adjustment into account in accordance with their interests in us during the tax year under audit, but there can be no assurance that such election will be effective in all circumstances.  If we are unable to have our general partner and our unitholders take such audit adjustment into account in accordance with their interests in us during the tax year under audit, our current unitholders may bear some or all of the tax liability resulting from such audit adjustment, even if such unitholders did not own units in us during the tax year under audit.  If, as a result of any such audit adjustment, we are required to make payments of taxes, penalties and interest, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced.. Tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected.. If you sell your common units, you will recognize a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the amount realized and your tax basis in those common units.  Because distributions in excess of your allocable share of our net taxable income decrease your tax basis in your common units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the common units you sell will, in effect, become taxable income to you if you sell such common units at a price greater than your tax basis in those common units, even if the price you receive is less than your original cost.  Furthermore, a substantial portion of the amount realized on any sale of your common units, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items, including depreciation and depletion recapture.  In addition, because the amount realized includes a unitholder's share of our nonrecourse liabilities, if you sell your common units, you may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash you receive from the sale.. Tax-exempt entities and non-U.S. persons face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.. Investment in common units by tax-exempt entities, such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (known as IRAs), and non-U.S. persons raises issues unique to them.  For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax, including IRAs and other retirement plans, is unrelated business taxable income and is taxable to them.. Distributions to non-U.S. persons are reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate, and non-U.S. persons are required to file federal income tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income.  If you are a tax-exempt entity or a non-U.S. person, you should consult a tax advisor before investing in our common units.. We treat each purchaser of common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased.  The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units.. Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and because of other reasons, we have adopted depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury Regulations.  A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to you.  It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain or loss from your sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to your tax returns.. We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our common units each month based upon the ownership of our common units on the first business day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge aspects of our proration method, and, if successful, we would be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.. We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our common units each month based upon the ownership of our common units on the first business day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred.  The U.S. Department of Treasury and the IRS have issued Treasury Regulations that permit publicly traded partnerships to use a monthly simplifying convention that is similar to ours, but they do not specifically authorize all aspects of the proration method we have adopted. If the IRS were to successfully challenge this method, we could be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.. 33. Table of Contents. A unitholder whose common units are loaned to a \"short seller\" to effect a short sale of common units may be considered as having disposed of those common units.  If so, he would no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.. Because a unitholder whose common units are loaned to a \"short seller\" to effect a short sale of common units may be considered as having disposed of the loaned common units, he may no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition.  Moreover, during the period of the loan to the short seller, any of our income, gain, loss or deductions with respect to those common units may not be reportable by the unitholder, and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those common units could be fully taxable as ordinary income.  Our unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to consult a tax advisor to discuss whether it is advisable to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from loaning their common units.. We may become a resident of Canada and be required to pay tax in Canada on our worldwide income, which could reduce our earnings, and unitholders could then become taxable in Canada in respect of their ownership of our common units.. Under the Income Tax Act (Canada), or the Canadian Tax Act, a company that is resident in Canada is subject to tax in Canada on its worldwide income, and unitholders of a company resident in Canada may be subject to Canadian capital gains tax on a disposition of its units and to Canadian withholding tax on dividends paid in respect of such units.. Under Canadian law, our place of residence would generally be determined based on the location where our central management and control is exercised.  Although our central management and control is currently exercised in the United States and we intend to continue to conduct our affairs and operate in such a manner, if we were nonetheless to be considered a Canadian resident for purposes of the Canadian Tax Act, our worldwide income would become subject to Canadian income tax under the Canadian Tax Act.  Further, unitholders who are non-residents of Canada may become subject under the Canadian Tax Act to tax in Canada on any gains realized on the disposition of our units and would become subject to Canadian withholding tax on dividends paid or deemed to be paid by us, subject to any relief that may be available under a tax treaty or convention.. As a result of investing in our common units, you may become subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in jurisdictions where we operate or own or acquire properties.. In addition to federal income taxes, our unitholders could be subject to other taxes, including state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or control property now or in the future, even if they do not live in any of those jurisdictions.  Our unitholders will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions.  Further, our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements.  We currently own property or conduct business in many states, most of which impose an income tax on individuals, corporations and other entities.  As we make acquisitions or expand our business, we may control assets or conduct business in additional states that impose a personal income tax.  It is your responsibility to file all federal, state and local tax returns.  Please consult your tax advisor.. 34. Table of Contents"
