[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. The following risk factors are based on management's current knowledge and estimates of factors affecting the Company's operations, both known and unknown. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking information as actual results may differ materially from the possible risks and outcomes discussed herein. In addition, a number of other factors (those identified elsewhere in this document and others, both known and unknown) may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.. A. H. Belo's newspapers operate in highly competitive media markets, and the Company's ability to generate revenue depends on the effectiveness of the Company's strategy to promote new and existing products.. The Company's businesses operate in highly competitive media markets. A. H. Belo's newspapers compete for advertising and circulation revenue with other newspapers, websites, digital applications, magazines, television, radio, direct mail and other media. The continued expansion of digital media and communications, particularly social media, mobile applications and the proliferation of tablet and mobile devices has increased some consumers' preferences to receive all or part of their news and information digitally. Websites such as craigslist.org,  monster.com and cars.com provide a cost efficient platform for reaching wide but targeted audiences for classified advertising. Websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google and Yahoo! are successful in gathering and making available national and local news and information from multiple sources and attracting a broad readership base.. Historically, newspaper publishing was viewed as a cost-effective method of delivery for various forms of advertising to a large audience. The continued development and deployment of new technologies and greater competition from digital media increases the challenge to the Company to provide competitive offerings to retain its print and digital advertisers and subscribers.. A. H. Belo's ability to stabilize advertising and circulation revenue through price and volume increases may be affected by competition from other forms of media and other publications available in the Company's various markets, declining consumer spending on discretionary items such as newspapers, decreasing amounts of free time and declining frequency of regular newspaper buying among certain demographic groups. The Company may also incur higher costs competing for paid circulation. If the Company is not able to compete effectively, revenue may decline and the Company's financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.. Purchasing practices of national advertisers could negatively impact the Company's pricing and ability to up-sell other products, which could result in lower revenues.. In line with the Company's overall print advertising revenue trend, national advertisers' marketing budgets have been significantly reduced. In addition, many national advertisers which place advertising in the Company's newspapers are centralizing purchasing functions and streamlining the buying and negotiating process. This could result in the commoditization of certain advertising products, which limits the Company's ability to promote its position in the market, the customer service value of its relationship with the advertiser, and the benefits of its suite of products, including the Company's ability to up-sell other products. This also may put the Company in competition with other advertising companies that are able to offer lower prices for a larger geographical area than the Company covers. Accordingly, the Company could experience a decline in pricing which could result in lower revenues and profitability.. <U+FEFF>. Decreases in circulation may adversely affect A. H. Belo's advertising and circulation revenue.. <U+FEFF>. A. H. Belo's newspapers, and the newspaper industry as a whole, are challenged to maintain and grow print circulation volume. To the extent circulation volume declines cannot be offset by rate increases, the Company will realize lower circulation revenue. Further, circulation volume declines could also result in lower rates and volumes for advertising revenue.. The expansion of programmatic advertising could result in lower realization of advertising revenue sold by the Company's news and entertainment websites.. Digital marketing services are becoming a significant component to business customers advertising strategies. Barriers to entering this industry are low and many competitors offering advertising services on traditional advertising platforms are seeking to gain market share, particularly through programmatic exchanges. As this industry expands, purchasing and selling of advertisement on exchanges is expected to result in lower costs of advertising which in-turn could be passed on to businesses customers. Such events could result in lower profit realization for digital advertising revenue within the Company's news and entertainment websites as it competes with exchange platforms for advertising dollars.. A. H. Belo Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K  \t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\tPAGE 11. Table of Contents. The growth and profitability of the Company's marketing services businesses are largely dependent on acceptance by local businesses and the recruitment and retention of key employees.. Marketing services offerings are rapidly evolving as business customers seek quantifiable results to measure the effectiveness of their advertising spending. The Company's marketing services customers primarily represent mid-sized businesses with varying degrees of knowledge and familiarity with online marketing and advertising campaigns. The success of the Company's marketing services offerings is dependent on the education of these customers on the benefits of these services to their businesses. Challenges may include the accuracy or perceived accuracy of metrics provided and the ability of the customer to properly interpret the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns against benchmarks that may not be reliable.. Increasing the Company's client base and achieving broader market acceptance of its suite of cross-channel, interactive marketing solutions will depend on the ability of sales and marketing teams and their capabilities to obtain new clients as well as sell additional products and services to existing clients. Competition is fierce for direct sales professionals with the skills and technical knowledge that is required, and the Company may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future. The ability to achieve significant future revenue growth will depend on the success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of direct sales professionals. New and planned hires require significant training and time before sales teams become fully productive, and may not become as productive as quickly as anticipated.  The Company's growth prospects could be harmed if efforts to expand, train and retain the direct sales team do not generate a corresponding significant increase in revenue.. Newsprint prices are volatile and may increase in the future, and newsprint supply may become increasingly scarce as paper mills exit the market.. <U+FEFF>. The basic raw material for newspapers is newsprint, the cost of which for the last three years has represented between approximately 5.0 percent and 6.0 percent of A. H. Belo's revenues. The Company's publishing operations depend significantly upon the continuing availability of newsprint and the Publishing segment's results of operations may be impacted significantly by changes in newsprint prices.  The price of newsprint historically has been volatile. Consolidation in the North American newsprint industry has reduced the number of suppliers and has led to paper mill closures and conversions to other grades of paper, which in turn has decreased overall newsprint capacity and increased the likelihood of higher prices. Other factors that may increase prices the Company pays for newsprint includes:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe imposition of tariffs or other restrictions on non-U.S. suppliers of paper.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIncreases in supplier operating expenses due to rising raw material or energy costs or other factors.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDecreases in the Company's current consumption levels.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe Company's inability to maintain existing relationships with its newsprint suppliers. <U+FEFF>. In addition, the Company's ability to supply its publishing operation with newsprint has been and may continue to be disrupted by such factors as:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe Company's suppliers may be unable to deliver newsprint due to labor unrest.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tTrucks or other means of transporting newsprint may become unavailable.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPaper mills may close at a faster rate than declines in the demand for paper. <U+FEFF>. A. H. Belo currently purchases most of its newsprint through a purchasing consortium. Significant increases in newsprint costs or the Company's inability to obtain an adequate supply of newsprint in the future could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. The Company's potential inability to successfully execute cost control measures could result in total operating costs that are greater than expected.. <U+FEFF>. The primary costs of the Company's operations include employee compensation and benefits, followed by distribution costs, newsprint and other production materials and technology costs. The Company has taken steps to lower costs through selling or discontinuing production of unprofitable operations and products, reducing personnel and restructuring employee benefits and implementing general cost control measures. Although the Company continues its cost control efforts, the Company may be unable to match revenue declines with offsetting cost reductions.. <U+FEFF>. Certain operating costs may not fluctuate directly with changes in revenue, which could result in lower margins if advertising and circulation volumes decline. The Company could also experience inflationary pressures from newsprint and other suppliers and be. A. H. Belo Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K  \t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\tPAGE 12. Table of Contents. unable to generate additional revenue or additional cost reductions to offset these inflationary pressures. The Company utilizes outside service providers to distribute its newspapers, and certain preprint advertising is distributed through the mail. Higher fuel costs or higher. postage rates could result in higher direct costs incurred by the Company to distribute its products.. <U+FEFF>. Increasing cost of healthcare benefits offered to employees requires the Company to evaluate the scope of benefits offered and the method in which health care benefits are delivered. Competition for qualified personnel may require the Company to spend more on compensation costs, including employee benefits, to attract and retain its workforce.. <U+FEFF>. The Company may not be able to pass on to customers these potential cost increases given the significant competition for advertising dollars and the ability of customers to obtain their news from other media at a low cost. If the Company does not achieve expected savings or if operating costs increase due to the creation and development of new products or otherwise, total operating costs may be greater than anticipated.. <U+FEFF>. The Company believes appropriate steps are being taken to control costs. However, if the Company is not successful in matching revenue declines with corresponding cost reductions, the Company's ability to generate future profits could be affected.. <U+FEFF>. The sufficiency of the Company's liquidity is dependent upon meeting future financial goals.. <U+FEFF>. Although the Company's cash holdings are sufficient to meet foreseeable operating needs, the Company must achieve expected financial goals. Unplanned events such as significant required pension plan contributions, tax obligations, significant loss of revenue, unprofitable operations or deterioration of collections of receivables, could accelerate the use of the Company's cash balances. The Company's ability to raise financial capital in the future may be hindered due to uncertainty regarding the newspaper industry's prospective performance. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, if and when needed, the Company may be forced to sell assets at below-market prices to sustain its operations.. <U+FEFF>. There can be no assurance that the Company's product and service initiatives will be successful.. <U+FEFF>. The Company has introduced new product and service initiatives designed to grow advertising and market services revenue and to respond to the challenges of maintaining revenue in existing markets. These initiatives may not be successful, may not be marketable or profitable and could result in declines in financial performance.. <U+FEFF>. Significant turnover of key employees could expose the Company to loss.. <U+FEFF>. A. H. Belo relies on the efforts of its senior executive officers and other members of management. The Company is located in a strong economic region of the United States with low unemployment and strong competition for senior management personnel. The success of the Company's businesses depends heavily on its ability to successfully execute the required responsibilities of these roles as well as the Company's ability to retain current management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. The loss of key personnel results in additional recruiting and training costs to the Company. Further, the exposure for loss to the Company and the potential delay of operations is elevated until the employee has sufficient knowledge commensurate with their assigned duties.. <U+FEFF>. Market conditions could increase the funding requirements associated with the Company's pension plans.. <U+FEFF>. The Company is the sole sponsor of A. H. Belo Pension Plans I and II (collectively, the \"A. H. Belo Pension Plans\" or the \"Pension Plans\") and is required to meet certain pension funding requirements as established under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"). Instability in global and domestic capital markets may result in low returns on the assets contributed to the A. H. Belo Pension Plans. Additionally, low yields on corporate bonds may decrease the discount rate, resulting in a higher funding obligation. Although legislation was enacted into law in 2012, which provided limited funding relief, market conditions could materially increase the funding requirements associated with the A. H. Belo Pension Plans, which could have an adverse impact on the Company's liquidity and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. Adverse results from new litigation or governmental proceedings or investigations could adversely affect A. H. Belo's business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. From time to time, A. H. Belo and its subsidiaries are subject to litigation, governmental proceedings and investigations. Adverse determinations in any such matters could require A. H. Belo to make monetary payments or result in other sanctions or findings that could affect adversely the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. A. H. Belo's directors and executive officers have significant combined voting power and significant influence over its management and affairs.. <U+FEFF>. A. H. Belo Corporation 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K  \t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\tPAGE 13. Table of Contents. A. H. Belo directors and executive officers hold approximately 50 percent of the voting power of the Company's outstanding voting stock as of December 31, 2017. A. H. Belo's Series A common stock has one vote per share and Series B common stock has 10 votes per share. Except for certain significant corporate transactions, generally all matters to be voted on by A. H. Belo's shareholders must be approved by a majority of the voting power of the Company's outstanding voting stock, voting as a single class. Certain corporate transactions, such as a merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, dissolution of the Company, the alteration, amendment, or repeal of A. H. Belo's bylaws by shareholders and certain amendments to A. H. Belo's certificate of incorporation, require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock, voting as a single class. Accordingly, A. H. Belo's directors and executive officers will have significant influence over the Company's management and affairs and over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions. This ownership may limit other shareholders' ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, A. H. Belo may take actions that some shareholders do not view as beneficial.. <U+FEFF>"
