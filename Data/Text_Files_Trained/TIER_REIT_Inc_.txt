[1] "Item 1A.            Risk Factors.. The factors described below represent what we believe are our principal risks. Other factors may exist that we do not consider to be significant based on information that is currently available or that we are not currently able to anticipate. The occurrence of any of the risks discussed below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the market price of our common stock and could affect our ability to pay distributions in any future periods.  Our stockholders may be referred to as \"you\" or \"your\" in this Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" section.. Risks Related to Our Business and Operations. Market disruptions may adversely impact many aspects of our operating results and operating condition.. The financial markets have been highly variable, and oil prices have declined dramatically over the past few years.  The availability of debt financing secured by commercial real estate is subject to tightened underwriting standards, and interest rates have been increasing, leading to widening credit spreads, all of which may lead to a slowdown in the U.S. economy as a whole, or impact real estate investments in some of the following ways:. • the financial condition of our tenants may be adversely affected, which may result in us having to reduce rental rates in order to retain tenants;. • an increase in the number of bankruptcies or insolvency proceedings of our tenants and lease guarantors could delay our efforts to collect rent and any past due balances under the relevant leases, and ultimately could preclude collection of these sums;. • our ability to borrow on terms and conditions that we find acceptable may be limited, which could result in our investment operations generating lower overall economic returns and a reduced level of cash flow, which could potentially impact our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or pursue acquisition opportunities, among other things, and increase our interest expense;. • the value of certain of our real estate assets may decrease below the amounts we paid for them, which would limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by these assets; and. • the value and liquidity of short-term investments, if any, could be reduced as a result of the dislocation of the markets for our short-term investments and increased volatility in market rates for these investments or other factors.. For these and other reasons, we cannot assure you that we will be profitable or that we will realize growth in the value of our investments.. We cannot predict the impact future actions by regulators or government bodies, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, will have on real estate debt markets or on our business, and any such actions may negatively impact us.. Regulators and U.S. government bodies have a major impact on our business. The U.S. Federal Reserve is a major participant in, and its actions significantly impact, the commercial real estate debt markets. For example, quantitative easing, a program implemented by the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep long-term interest rates low and stimulate the U.S. economy, had the effect of reducing the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates. However, the U.S. Federal Reserve ended the latest round of quantitative easing and has raised interest rates.  Rising interest rates increase the cost of borrowing, which could limit our flexibility. This may result in future acquisitions by us generating lower overall economic returns and increasing the costs associated with refinancing current debt, which could potentially reduce future cash flow available for distribution. We cannot predict or control the impact future actions by regulators or government bodies, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, will have on our business.  For example, it is difficult to predict future legislation, regulation, and actions under the current presidential administration.. 7. Economic conditions may adversely affect our income, and we could be subject to risks associated with acquiring real estate assets.. U.S. and international financial markets have been highly variable.  The effects of financial market volatility may persist particularly as financial institutions continue to restructure their businesses and capital structures in response to new or enhanced regulatory requirements, all of which could impact the availability of credit and overall economic activity as a whole.. In addition, we are subject to the risks generally incident to the ownership of real estate assets. For example, even though we may purchase assets at a discount from historical cost or market value due to, among other things, substantial deferred maintenance or poorly structured financing of the real estate or debt instruments underlying the assets, or we may currently own properties with similar factors, there is no assurance that we will be able to overcome these factors. All of these factors could further decrease the value of real estate assets.. Further, fluctuations in market conditions make judging the future performance of these assets difficult. The real estate assets we own or may acquire may substantially decline in value, which would, among other things, negatively impact our ability to finance or refinance debt secured by these assets or earn positive returns on these assets, and may require us to write down or impair the value of these assets, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and ability to pay or sustain distributions.. Our ongoing strategy depends, in part, upon future acquisitions and development, and we may not be successful in identifying and consummating these transactions.. A part of our business strategy contemplates strategic expansion through the acquisition and development of institutional quality office properties. We may not be successful in identifying suitable properties or other assets or in consummating these transactions on satisfactory terms, or at all. We would likely need access to capital in order to fund any of these types of transactions. There is no assurance we would have access to capital on acceptable terms and conditions, or at all.. Further, we face significant competition for attractive investment opportunities from an indeterminate number of other real estate investors, including investors with significant capital resources such as domestic and foreign corporations and financial institutions, publicly traded and privately held REITs, private institutional investment funds, investment banking firms, life insurance companies, and pension funds.  As a result of competition, we may be unable to acquire additional properties as we desire or the purchase price may be significantly elevated.. Development and construction projects are subject to significant risks, including the risks that such projects are more costly than anticipated and that we may not successfully complete and operate developed properties.. We may, from time to time, develop and construct new properties or redevelop existing properties. In doing so, we will be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with construction and development including the environmental concerns of governmental entities or community groups and our builder's ability to control construction costs or to build in conformity with plans, specifications, and timetables. The builder's failure to perform may necessitate legal action by us to rescind the purchase or the construction contract or to compel performance. Performance also may be affected or delayed by conditions beyond the builder's control. Delays in completion of construction also could give tenants the right to terminate preconstruction leases for space at a newly developed project. We may incur additional risks when we make periodic progress payments or other advances to builders prior to completion of construction. These and other such factors can result in increased costs of a project or loss of our investment. We may expend significant time and money on projects that are never completed, our construction costs, including labor and materials, may be higher than estimated, and we may be unable to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all. In addition, we are subject to normal lease-up risks relating to newly constructed projects or re-developed projects, and occupancy and rental rates at a newly-completed property may not meet our expectations.  Furthermore, we must rely upon projections of rental income and expenses and estimates of the fair market value of property upon completion of construction when agreeing upon a price to be paid for the property at the time of acquisition of the property.  If our projections are inaccurate, we may pay too much for a property, and our return on our investment could suffer. We may also invest in unimproved real property. Returns from development of unimproved properties also are subject to additional risks and uncertainties such as those associated with rezoning.. 8. Leases representing approximately 4% of the rentable area within our operating office properties (excluding our held for sale properties) are scheduled to expire in 2018. We may be unable to renew leases or lease vacant space at favorable rates or at all.. As of December 31, 2017, leases representing approximately 4% of the rentable area within our operating office properties (excluding our held for sale properties) were scheduled to expire in 2018. We may be unable to extend or renew any of the expiring leases, or we may be able to re-lease these spaces only at rental rates equal to or below the expiring rental rates. We also may not be able to lease space which is currently not occupied on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all. In addition, some of our tenants have leases that include early termination provisions that permit the lessee to terminate all or a portion of its lease with us after a specified date or upon the occurrence of certain events with little or no liability to us. We may be required to offer substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights, or below-market renewal options to retain these tenants or attract new ones.  Portions of our properties may remain vacant for extended periods of time. Further, some of our leases currently provide tenants with options to renew the terms of their leases at rates that are less than the current market rate. If we are unable to obtain new rental rates that are on average comparable to our asking rents across our portfolio, then our ability to increase cash flow will be negatively impacted.. We may be required to make significant capital expenditures to improve our properties in order to retain and attract tenants and are uncertain of the sources of, and may be unable to obtain funding for, all of our future capital needs.. We require capital on an ongoing basis to fund tenant improvements, leasing commissions, and capital expenditures. Specifically, we may be required to expend substantial funds to improve or refurbish leasable space either to retain existing tenants or to attract new tenants. We expect that, upon the expiration of leases at our properties, we may be required to make rent or other concessions to tenants; accommodate requests for renovations, build-to-suit remodeling, and other improvements; or provide additional services to our tenants. As a result, we may have to pay for significant leasing costs or tenant improvements in order to retain tenants whose leases are expiring or to attract new tenants. The reserves we have established for capital improvements may not be sufficient, which would require us to seek funds from other sources.  Moreover, certain reserves required by lenders are designated for specific uses and may not be available to use for tenant improvements. Our ability to fund future property capital needs may depend on our ability to borrow, to raise capital, including through the disposition of certain of our assets or interests in assets or equity offerings, or to generate additional cash flow from operations. There can be no assurance that any of these sources will be available, and some of these strategies pose additional risks. For example, if we sell assets, it will likely have the effect of reducing cash flow from operating activities. Alternatively, if we decide to raise capital by offering shares of common or preferred stock, or any other securities that are convertible into, exercisable, or exchangeable for our capital stock, the issuance could have the effect of diluting the proportionate equity interest and voting power of our existing stockholders. Ultimately, if we are unable to fund our capital needs, we may be required to, among other things, defer necessary improvements to our properties, which may cause the properties to suffer from a greater risk of obsolescence or a decline in value, or we may experience decreased cash flow as a result of non-renewals by tenants upon expiration of their leases or fewer tenants being attracted to a property. If this happens, we may not be able to maintain expiring rental rates for the affected properties.. We face significant competition in the leasing market, which may decrease or prevent increases in the occupancy and rental rates of our properties.. We own properties located in metropolitan cities and suburban markets in the United States. We compete with numerous developers, owners, and operators of office properties, many of which own properties similar to, and in the same market areas as, our properties.  If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates, or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose existing or potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to attract new tenants and retain existing tenants when their leases expire. Also, as our competitors develop additional office properties in locations near our properties, there will likely be increased competition for creditworthy tenants which may require us to make capital improvements to properties that we would not have otherwise made or further reduce rents.. We depend on tenants for our revenue, and accordingly, lease terminations and tenant defaults could adversely affect the income produced by our properties.. The success of our investments materially depends on the financial stability of our tenants, many of which are financial, legal and other professional firms and many of whom may experience a change in their business at any time. Economic conditions have adversely affected in the past, and could adversely affect in the future, one or more of our tenants. As a result, our tenants may delay lease commencements, decline to extend or renew their leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due or declare bankruptcy. Any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants' leases, or expiration of existing leases. 9. without renewal, and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated or expired leases. In the event of a tenant default or bankruptcy, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment and re-leasing our property. Specifically, a bankruptcy filing by, or relating to, one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from that tenant or lease guarantor unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court. In addition, we cannot evict a tenant solely because of bankruptcy. The bankruptcy of a tenant or lease guarantor could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases, and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums. If a lease is assumed by a tenant in bankruptcy, all pre-bankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full.  If, however, a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only a general, unsecured claim for damages. An unsecured claim would only be paid to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of general, unsecured claims.  Restrictions under the bankruptcy laws further limit the amount of any other claims that we can make if a lease is rejected. As a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of the remaining rent during the term.. One of our balance sheet strategies involves the disposition of properties; however, we may be unable to sell a property on acceptable terms and conditions, or at all.. One of our balance sheet strategies is to sell or otherwise dispose of certain properties. We believe it makes economic sense to do so in today's market in certain instances, such as when we believe there is strong investment interest in a market, when we believe the value of the leases in place at a property will significantly decline over the remaining lease term, when we believe we have limited or no equity in a property that secures debt with a near- term maturity, when we do have equity in a property but the projected returns do not justify further investment, or when we believe the equity in a property can be redeployed in the portfolio in order to achieve better returns or strategic goals. However, certain market conditions generally, and property specific issues such as vacancies and lease terminations, could negatively affect the value of our investment properties and therefore reduce our ability to sell or otherwise dispose of these properties on acceptable terms or at all.  In addition, the \"prohibited transaction\" rules (discussed below) may limit our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders.  Real estate investments generally, and in particular large office properties like those that we own, often cannot be sold quickly, particularly when coupled with a debt assumption. Furthermore, properties that we have owned for a significant period of time may have a low tax basis.  If we were to dispose of any of these properties in a taxable transaction, we may be required, under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), applicable to REITs, to distribute a significant amount of the taxable gain, if any, to our stockholders and this could, in turn, impact our cash flow. In addition, purchase options and rights of first refusal held by tenants or partners in joint ventures may also limit our ability to sell certain properties. All of these factors limit our ability to effectuate this particular balance sheet strategy.. If we sell properties and provide financing to purchasers, defaults by the purchasers would decrease our cash flows and limit our ability to make distributions.. In some instances we may sell our properties by providing financing to purchasers. When we provide financing to purchasers, we will bear the risk that the purchaser may default, which could negatively impact our liquidity and results of operations. Even in the absence of a purchaser default, the distribution of the proceeds of sales to our stockholders, or the reinvestment of proceeds in other assets, will be delayed until the promissory notes or other property we may accept upon a sale are actually paid, sold, refinanced, or otherwise disposed.. Our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial health and operating flexibility.. As of December 31, 2017, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $794.5 million, excluding debt of our unconsolidated entities.  As a result of our indebtedness, we are required to use a material portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which limits the cash flow available for other purposes. In addition, we may not generate sufficient cash flow after debt service to, among other things, fund capital expenditures and pay distributions. Our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements, including our credit facility agreement, could have significant adverse consequences to us, regardless of our ability to refinance or extend our debt, including:. • limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts for, among other things, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business plan, or other purposes;. • limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business or to pay distributions;. • increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;. 10. • limiting our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in governmental regulation;. • limiting our ability to fund capital expenditures, tenant improvements, and leasing commissions; and. • limiting our ability or increasing the costs to refinance our indebtedness.. We have experienced net losses attributable to our common stockholders, and we may experience future losses.. Although we had positive net income attributable to our common stockholders of approximately $84.3 million, primarily as a result of gains on the sale of properties for the year ended December 31, 2017, we had net losses attributable to our common stockholders of approximately $29.4 million and $32.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. If we incur net losses in the future or such losses increase, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay distributions to our stockholders will be materially and adversely affected.. Economic, regulatory, and socio-economic changes that impact the real estate market generally or that could affect patterns of use of commercial office space may cause our operating results to suffer and decrease the value of our real estate properties.. If our properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses, debt service, and capital expenditures, it is unlikely we could continue to pay distributions to our stockholders. In addition, there are significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes, and maintenance costs) that generally do not decline even if the income from the property has declined. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the operating performance and long- or short-term value of our properties:. • changes in the national, regional, and local economic climates, particularly in markets in which we have a concentration of properties;. • local office submarket conditions such as changes in the supply of, or demand for, space in properties similar to those that we own within a particular area;. • changes in the patterns of office use due to technological advances which may make telecommuting more prevalent;. • the attractiveness of our properties to potential tenants;. • changes in interest rates and availability of permanent mortgage funds that may render the sale of a property difficult or unattractive or otherwise reduce returns to stockholders;. • the financial stability of our tenants, including bankruptcies, financial difficulties, or lease defaults by our tenants;. • changes in operating costs and expenses, including costs for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes, and our ability to control rents in light of such changes;. • the need to periodically fund the costs to repair, renovate, and re-lease space;. • earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters; civil unrest, terrorist acts, or acts of war; and public health emergencies, including the spread of infectious diseases, such as Ebola, any of which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses;. • changes in, or increased costs of compliance with, governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment, and taxes; and. • changes in accounting standards.. Any of these factors may cause a decrease in the value of our real estate properties.. 11. The geographic concentration of our portfolio may make us particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in the real estate markets of those areas.. In addition to general, regional, and national economic conditions, our operating results are impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties.  Properties located in Austin, Dallas, and Houston, Texas, generated approximately 69.8% of our consolidated rental revenue from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.  For properties located in Austin, Dallas, and Houston, Texas, leases scheduled to expire in 2018 and 2019 represent approximately 5% and 8%, respectively, of our total occupied square feet as of December 31, 2017.  Any adverse economic or real estate developments in these markets, such as business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, changing demographics, and other factors, or any decrease in demand for office space resulting from the local business climate, could adversely affect our property revenue, and hence, net operating income.. A significant number of our properties are located in or near energy producing and energy dependent regions, and if energy prices remain depressed, our financial results could be negatively impacted.. We have a substantial number of properties that are located in or near energy producing and energy dependent regions. In particular, we have five operating properties with approximately 2.2 million rentable square feet located in Houston, Texas, that comprised approximately $61.2 million, or 28.3%, of our consolidated rental revenue from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.  The Houston area is heavily dependent upon the energy sector. The prices of oil and gas declined dramatically during 2015 and have been volatile over the past few years.  Depressed prices have had a significant adverse impact on the Houston economy, and companies in the oil and gas industries, including our tenants and prospective tenants.  If these conditions persist, our tenants and prospective tenants will likely curtail their level of operations, reduce the size of their workforces, and otherwise experience significant adverse impacts.  In addition, a decline in the oil and gas industries would likely adversely affect companies, including our tenants and prospective tenants, in businesses that service or supply the oil and gas industries as well as businesses, including our tenants and prospective tenants, in unrelated industries located in areas like Houston that have benefited from the economic expansion generated by previous robust growth driven in part by higher oil prices. A prolonged period of low oil or gas prices or other factors negatively impacting the energy industry could have an adverse impact on our ability to maintain the occupancy of our Houston properties or could cause us to lease space at rates below current in place rents or at rates below the rates at which we have leased space in our Houston properties over the prior year. In addition, a prolonged period of low oil or gas prices or other factors negatively impacting the energy industry could have an adverse impact on the ability of our energy tenants to pay rent or could cause them to vacate their premises prior to, or at the conclusion of, their lease terms. Any such events could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, factors negatively impacting the energy industry could reduce the market values of our Houston properties which could reduce our net asset value and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. We may be adversely affected by trends in the office real estate industry.. Some businesses are rapidly evolving to increasingly permit employee telecommuting, flexible work schedules, open workplaces, and teleconferencing. These practices enable businesses to reduce their space requirements. A continuation of the movement towards these practices could over time erode the overall demand for office space and, in turn, place downward pressure on occupancy, rental rates, and property valuations.. An oversupply of space in any of our markets could cause rental rates and occupancies to decline, making it more difficult for us to lease space at attractive rental rates, or at all.. Undeveloped land in some of the markets in which we operate is generally more readily available and less expensive than in higher barrier-to-entry markets such as New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. As a result, even during times of positive economic growth, our competitors could construct new buildings that would compete with our properties. Any such increase in supply could result in lower occupancy and rental rates in our portfolio.. A concentration of our investments in any one property class may leave our profitability vulnerable to a downturn in that sector.. Substantially all of our properties are institutional quality office properties. As a result, we are subject to risks inherent in operating a single type of property.  Any downturn in the office sector may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. 12. Adverse market and economic conditions may adversely affect us and could cause us to recognize impairment charges on real estate assets.. We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying value of our real estate related assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present which indicate that the carrying value of our real estate related assets may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated over the life of the asset including its eventual disposition. In the event that the carrying value exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows and also exceeds the fair value of the asset, we adjust the real estate related assets to fair value and recognize an impairment charge.. Projections of expected future cash flows require management to make assumptions to estimate future market rental income amounts subsequent to the expiration of current lease agreements, property operating expenses, the number of months it takes to re-lease the property, and the number of years the property is held for investment, among other factors. The subjectivity of assumptions used in the future cash flow analysis, including discount rates, could result in an incorrect assessment of the property's fair value and, therefore, could result in the misstatement of the carrying value of our real estate and related lease intangible assets and our net income.. Adverse market and economic conditions and market volatility may make it difficult to value our real estate assets. As a result of adverse market and economic conditions, there may be significant uncertainty in the valuation, or in the stability of, the cash flows, discount rates, and other factors related to such assets that could result in a substantial decrease in their value. We may be required to recognize additional asset impairment charges in the future.. If we lose or are unable to obtain key personnel, our ability to implement our business and investment strategies and key objectives could be delayed or hindered.. Our ability to achieve our strategies and objectives depends, to a significant degree, upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and our other key personnel. The employment agreements that we have with our executive officers are terminable upon notice, and we cannot guarantee that we will retain our executive officers. We believe that our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain and hire highly-skilled managerial and operating personnel. Competition for persons with managerial and operational skills is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in retaining or attracting skilled personnel.  If we lose or are unable to obtain the services of our executive officers and other key personnel, or do not establish or maintain the necessary strategic relationships, our ability to implement our business and investment strategies and key objectives could be delayed or hindered, and our operations and financial results could suffer.. Competition for skilled personnel could increase labor costs.. We compete with various other companies in attracting and retaining qualified and skilled personnel. We depend on our ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our company. Competitive pressures may require that we enhance our pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel. We may not be able to offset such added costs by increasing the rates we charge our tenants. If there is an increase in these costs or if we fail to attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel, our business and operating results could be harmed.. Compensation awards to our management may not be tied to or correspond with our financial results or the price per share of our common stock.. The compensation committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our compensation and employee benefit plans and practices, including our executive compensation plans and our incentive compensation and equity-based compensation plans. Our compensation committee has significant discretion in structuring compensation packages and may make compensation decisions based on competitive market practices or any number of other factors. As a result, compensation awards may not be tied to or correspond with financial results at our company or the price per share of our common stock.. Our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments.. In appropriate circumstances, we intend to acquire, develop, and recapitalize properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures. We currently have joint ventures that are not consolidated within our financial statements.  Our participation in joint ventures is subject to the risks that:. 13. • we could become engaged in a dispute with any of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to develop, finance, or operate a property and could lead to the sale of either party's ownership interest or the property;. • we may not have sole decision-making authority with respect to the joint venture which could prevent us from taking actions that are in our best interests;. • our joint ventures may be subject to debt and any refinancing of such debt may require equity capital calls;. • our joint venture partners may default on their obligations necessitating that we fulfill their obligations ourselves;. • our joint venture partners may have different objectives than we have regarding the appropriate timing and terms of the development, sale, or refinancing of a property;. • our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes and this could create conflicts of interest;. • our joint venture partners may take actions that are not within our control, which could jeopardize our qualification as a REIT or the tax status of the joint venture, requiring us to pay taxes or subjecting properties owned by the joint venture to liabilities greater than those contemplated by the terms of the joint venture agreements;. • our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest; and. • our joint ventures may be unable to repay any amounts that we may loan to them.. The failure of any bank in which we deposit our funds could reduce the amount of cash we have available for our operations or to pay distributions or make additional investments.. We have diversified our cash and cash equivalents between several banking institutions in an attempt to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.  However, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or \"FDIC,\" generally only insures limited amounts per depositor per insured bank.  We have cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash deposited in interest bearing accounts at certain financial institutions exceeding these federally insured levels. If any of the banking institutions in which we have deposited funds ultimately fails, we may lose the portion of our deposits that exceed the federally insured levels. The loss of our deposits would reduce the amount of cash we have available for our operations, to pay distributions, or to make additional investments.. We face risks associated with short-term liquid investments.. From time to time, we have significant cash balances that we invest in a variety of short-term investments that are intended to preserve principal value and maintain a high degree of liquidity while providing current income. These investments may include (either directly or indirectly):. • direct obligations issued by the U.S. Treasury;. • obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies;. • taxable municipal securities;. • obligations (including certificates of deposits) of banks and thrifts;. • commercial paper and other instruments consisting of short-term U.S. dollar denominated obligations issued by corporations and banks;. • repurchase agreements collateralized by corporate and asset-backed obligations;. • both registered and unregistered money market funds; and. • other highly rated short-term securities.. Investments in these securities and funds are not insured against loss of principal. Under certain circumstances we may be required to redeem all or part of our investment or our right to redeem some or all of our investment may be delayed or suspended.. 14. In addition, there is no guarantee that our investments in these securities or funds will be redeemable at par value. A decline in the value of our investment or a delay or suspension of our right to redeem may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.. An increase in real estate taxes may decrease our income from properties.. Generally, from time to time our property taxes will increase as property values or assessment rates change or for other reasons deemed relevant by the assessors. An increase in the assessed valuation of a property for real estate tax purposes results in an increase in the related real estate taxes on that property. Although some tenant leases may permit us to pass the tax increases through to the tenants for payment, there is no assurance that renewal leases or future leases will be negotiated on the same basis. Increases not passed through to tenants will adversely affect our income and our cash available to pay distributions, if any.. We may suffer uninsured losses or losses in excess of insured limits relating to real property or pay excessively expensive premiums for insurance coverage.. Although we attempt to ensure that all of our properties are adequately insured to cover casualty losses, there are certain types of losses, generally catastrophic in nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, pollution, or environmental matters, that are uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be insured subject to limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments.  Insurance risks associated with potential terrorist acts could sharply increase the premiums we pay for coverage against property and casualty claims.  Mortgage lenders generally insist that specific coverage against terrorism be purchased by commercial property owners as a condition for providing mortgage, bridge, or mezzanine loans. We cannot be certain that this coverage will continue to be available, or available at reasonable cost, if at all, which could inhibit our ability to finance or refinance our properties. We may be required to provide other financial support, either through financial assurances or self-insurance, to cover potential losses. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate coverage for any losses we may suffer. In addition, other than any capital reserve we may establish, we will have limited sources of funding to repair or reconstruct any uninsured damaged property, and we cannot assure you that those reserves will be sufficient.. Should one of our insurance carriers become insolvent, we would be adversely affected.. We carry several different lines of insurance placed with several large insurance carriers. If any one of our large insurance carriers were to become insolvent, any outstanding claims would be at risk for collection. Further, in such an event, we would be forced to replace the existing insurance coverage with another suitable carrier, possibly at unfavorable rates or terms.. Future terrorist attacks, military conflicts, and global unrest could have a material adverse effect on general economic conditions, consumer confidence, and market liquidity.. Terrorist attacks, ongoing and future military conflicts, and the continued global unrest may affect commodity prices and interest rates, among other things. An increase in interest rates may increase our cost of borrowing, leading to a reduction in our earnings. An increase in the price of oil will also cause an increase in our operating costs, which may not be reimbursed by our tenants. Also, terrorist acts could result in significant damages to, or loss of, our properties or the value thereof.. We and the tenants of the properties in which we have an interest may be unable to obtain adequate insurance coverage on acceptable economic terms for losses resulting from acts of terrorism. Our lenders may require that we carry terrorism insurance even if we do not believe this insurance is necessary or cost effective. We may also be prohibited under the applicable lease from passing all or a portion of the cost of such insurance through to our tenants. Should an act of terrorism result in an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose capital invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues from a property while remaining obligated for any mortgage indebtedness or other financial obligations related to the property.. Actual or threatened terrorist attacks may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties.. We have significant investments in large metropolitan markets that have been or may be in the future the targets of actual or threatened terrorism attacks. As a result, some tenants in these markets may choose to relocate their businesses to other markets or to lower-profile office buildings within these markets that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity. This could result in an overall decrease in the demand for office space in these markets generally or in our properties in particular, which could increase vacancies in our properties or necessitate that we lease our properties on less favorable terms or both. In addition, future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our properties, both physically and financially, or cause losses that materially exceed our insurance coverage. As a result of the foregoing, our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties could decline materially.. 15. Some of our properties are concentrated in regions that are particularly susceptible to extreme weather or natural disasters.. Certain of our properties are located in geographical areas, such as Florida and Texas, that are regularly impacted by extreme weather and natural disasters, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, winds, floods, hurricanes, and fires.  Natural disasters in these areas may cause damage to our properties beyond the scope of our insurance coverage, thus requiring us to make substantial expenditures to repair these properties and resulting in a loss of revenues from these properties.  Further, several of these properties are located near the coast and are exposed to more severe weather than our properties located inland. Elements such as salt water and humidity in these areas can increase or accelerate wear on the properties' weatherproofing and mechanical, electrical, and other systems, and cause mold issues over time. As a result, we may incur operating costs and expenditures for capital improvements at these properties in excess of those normally anticipated.. Our Eldridge Properties sustained flood-related damage as a result of Hurricane Harvey and its aftermath, and the impact of such damage could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.. During the third quarter of 2017, One & Two Eldridge Place and Three Eldridge Place (collectively known as the \"Eldridge Properties\") experienced flood-related damage as a result of Hurricane Harvey and its aftermath.  From August 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017, we provided rent abatements of approximately $7.0 million to tenants because the properties had not been restored to pre-loss condition.  We incurred approximately $8.6 million of restoration costs during the year ended December 31, 2017.  By early January 2018, all of the properties were fully operational, but we expect to incur additional costs over a period of time to fully restore the properties to their pre-loss condition.. We carry comprehensive property, casualty, flood and business interruption insurance that we anticipate will cover our losses at the properties, subject to a deductible.  Insurance payments to us may be delayed, which could have a material adverse impact on our results prior to our receipt of such payments.  In addition, our results of operations may be adversely impacted to the extent that our insurance coverage does not cover all of the losses that we expect or in connection with litigation relating to the property damage, insurance claims or lease disputes arising out of Hurricane Harvey and its aftermath.  To the extent that we are unable to sufficiently restore the condition of each of the buildings, primarily comprised of the first floor of each building and mechanical systems, in a timely manner, our tenants at these properties may have a right to terminate their leases, which could materially impact our results of operations, particularly if we are unable to recover potential losses through insurance coverage or we are unable to lease the space to new tenants on a timely basis or at comparable rates.  To date, one tenant has delivered a purported notice of termination relating to a significant lease; however, we have contested such notice and discussions between the parties are ongoing.  There can be no assurances as to the results of such discussions or whether other tenants might exercise or purport to exercise a termination right.. We face possible risks associated with the physical effects of climate change.. We cannot predict the rate at which climate change will progress. However, the physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, and business. To the extent that climate change impacts changes in weather patterns, some of our properties could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels.  Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for space at our properties or result in our inability to operate the buildings at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of, or availability of, property insurance on terms we find acceptable, increasing the cost of energy, and increasing the cost of snow removal at our properties. There can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, or business.. Security breaches through cyber-attacks, cyber-intrusions, or otherwise, could disrupt our IT networks and related systems.. Risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, or otherwise, against persons inside our organization, persons with access to systems inside our organization, the U.S. government, financial markets or institutions, or major businesses, including tenants, could disrupt or disable networks and related systems, other critical infrastructures, and the normal operation of business. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber-terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Even though we may not be specifically targeted, cyber-attacks on the U.S. government, financial markets, financial institutions, or other major businesses, including tenants, could disrupt our normal business operations and networks, which may in turn have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.. 16. IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations. They also may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. Although we believe we will be able to maintain the security and integrity of these types of networks and related systems, or implement various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.  Even the most well protected information, networks, systems, and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected.  While, to date, we are not aware that we have experienced any significant cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions, we may not be able to anticipate or implement adequate security barriers or other preventive measures. A security breach or other significant disruption involving our IT networks and related systems could:. • disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our tenants;. • result in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants, missed reporting deadlines, and/or missed permitting deadlines;. • result in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations  regarding our qualification as a REIT;. • result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation, or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive, or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive, or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;. • result in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space;. • require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result;. • subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties, or termination of leases  or other agreements; or. • damage our reputation among our tenants and stockholders generally.. Any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.. The cost of complying with environmental and other governmental laws and regulations may adversely affect us, and we may become subject to liability relating to environmental matters.. All real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. These laws and regulations generally govern wastewater discharges, air emissions, the operation and removal of underground and above-ground storage tanks, the use, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, and the remediation of contamination associated with disposals. We also are required to comply with various local, state, and federal fire, health, life-safety, and similar regulations. Some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability on tenants or owners for the costs of investigating or remediating contaminated properties. These laws and regulations often impose liability whether or not the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The cost of removing or remediating could be substantial. In addition, the presence of these substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent a property or to use the property as collateral for borrowing.. Environmental laws and regulations also may impose restrictions on the manner in which properties may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures by us. Environmental laws and regulations provide for sanctions in the event of noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Third parties may seek recovery from owners of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances.  Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws may require material expenditures by us.  For example, various federal, state, and local laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Among other things, \"green\" building codes may seek to reduce emissions through the imposition of standards for design, construction materials, water and energy usage and efficiency, and waste management. We are not aware of any such. 17. existing requirements that we believe will have a material impact on our current operations. However, future requirements could increase the costs of maintaining or improving our existing properties or developing new properties.. Our costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act may affect cash available for our operations, to pay distributions, or to make additional investments.. Our real properties are generally subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (the \"Act\"). Under the Act, all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons.  The Act has separate compliance requirements for \"public accommodations\" and \"commercial facilities\" generally requiring that buildings and services be made accessible and available to people with disabilities. The Act's requirements could require removal of access barriers and could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, monetary penalties or, in some cases, an award of damages.  We attempt to acquire properties that comply with the Act or any relevant law or regulation of a foreign jurisdiction or place the burden on the seller or other third party, such as a tenant, to ensure compliance with those laws or regulations. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire properties or allocate responsibilities in this manner.. We may from time to time be subject to litigation that may negatively impact our cash flow, financial condition, results of operations and market price of our common stock.. We may from time to time be a defendant in lawsuits and regulatory proceedings relating to our business. Such litigation and proceedings may result in defense costs, settlements, fines, or judgments against us, some of which may not be covered by insurance. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such litigation or proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could negatively impact our cash flow, financial condition, results of operations, and trading price of our common stock. In addition, certain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow, expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured, and/or adversely impact our ability to attract officers and directors.. We may be subject to other possible liabilities.. Our properties may be subject to other risks related to current or future laws, including laws benefiting disabled persons, state or local laws relating to zoning, construction, fire and life safety requirements, and other matters. These laws may require significant property modifications in the future and could result in the levy of fines against us. In addition, although we believe that we adequately insure our properties, we are subject to the risk that our insurance may not cover all of the costs to restore a property that is damaged by a fire or other catastrophic events, including acts of war or, as mentioned above, terrorism.. Our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and our operating results.. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, as such standards may be modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may be required to disclose such failure and our financial reporting may not be relied on by most stockholders. Moreover, effective internal control, particularly related to revenue recognition, is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and to maintain our qualification as a REIT and is important in helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, our REIT qualification could be jeopardized, and stockholders could lose confidence in our reported financial information.. Risks Related to Financing. Our borrowings may increase our business risks.. Principal and interest payments reduce cash that would otherwise be available for other purposes.  Further, incurring mortgage debt increases the risk of loss because (1) loss in investment value is generally borne entirely by the borrower until such time as the investment value declines below the principal balance of the associated debt and (2) defaults on indebtedness secured by a property may result in foreclosure actions initiated by lenders and our loss of the property securing the loan that is in default. We have experienced defaults resulting in our having to transfer properties to the respective lenders, and may do so again if our asset values do not support the underlying loans. For federal income tax purposes, a foreclosure generally is treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage. If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure, but. 18. would not receive any cash proceeds. From time to time, we provide full or partial guarantees to lenders of mortgage debt to our indirect subsidiaries that own our properties. When we guarantee debt on behalf of an entity that owns one of our properties, we are thus responsible to the lender for satisfaction of the debt if it is not paid by the entity.  To date, we have not been required to fund any of the guarantees that we have provided. If any mortgages contain cross-collateralization or cross-default provisions there is a risk that more than one real property may be affected by a default.. We may not be able to refinance or repay our indebtedness.. We may not be able to refinance or repay our existing indebtedness. Previously, we have faced significant challenges refinancing our debt due to (1) the reduced value of our real estate assets; (2) limited cash flow from operating activities; (3) our debt level; (4) the cost and terms of new or refinanced indebtedness; and (5) material changes in lending parameters, including lower loan-to-value ratios.. Failure to refinance or extend our debt as it comes due or a failure to satisfy the conditions and requirements of that debt would likely result in an event of default and potentially the loss of the property or properties securing the debt. We have experienced defaults or events of default on previous indebtedness, which has required us to either restructure the debt in a way that is supported by the underlying values of the property or properties collateralizing the debt or to purchase or pay off the debt at a discount. In certain instances, we were unable to repay or restructure our indebtedness, or to purchase or pay it off at a discount, and the lender accelerated the debt and/or foreclosed on the property or properties securing the debt. We have experienced this result with several properties where we ultimately allowed the lender to foreclose or transferred the underlying properties to the lender pursuant to deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure, thus losing our entire investment in these properties.. Existing loan agreements contain, and future financing arrangements will likely contain, restrictive covenants relating to our operations.. We are subject to certain restrictions pursuant to the restrictive covenants of our outstanding indebtedness, which may affect our distribution and operating policies and our ability to incur additional debt. Our credit facility, for example, restricts us from paying any distributions, other than as required to maintain our REIT qualification, in excess of  95% of funds from operations as defined by National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\").  In addition, a breach of the financial and operating covenants in our debt agreements, including our credit facility agreement, could cause a default and accelerate payment under these agreements which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Specifically, violating the covenants contained in our credit facility agreement would likely result in us incurring higher finance costs and fees or an acceleration of the maturity date of advances under the credit facility agreement.. Interest-only indebtedness may increase our risk of default.. We have obtained, and continue to incur interest on interest-only mortgage indebtedness.  As of December 31, 2017, approximately $676.0 million of our outstanding debt requires interest-only payments. During the interest-only period the amount of each scheduled payment is less than that of a traditional amortizing mortgage loan, and the principal balance of the mortgage loan is not being reduced (except in the case of prepayments) because there are no scheduled monthly payments of principal during this period. After the interest-only period we will be required either to make scheduled payments of principal and interest or to make a lump-sum or \"balloon\" payment at maturity. These required monthly or balloon principal payments will increase the amount of our scheduled payments and may increase our risk of default under the related mortgage loan and will otherwise reduce the funds available for other purposes, including funding capital expenditures or any future distributions to our stockholders.. Increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments.. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $610.0 million of debt that bears interest at a variable rate.  Approximately $525.0 million of this variable rate debt has been effectively fixed through the use of interest rate swaps.  Thus, we are potentially exposed to increases in costs in a rising interest rate environment. Increased payments will reduce the funds available for other purposes including funding capital expenditures or distributions to our stockholders. In addition, if rising interest rates cause us to need additional capital to repay indebtedness, we may be forced to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate at times which may result in losses, or not permit us to realize the return on the investments we would have otherwise realized.. To hedge against interest rate fluctuations, we use derivative financial instruments, which will subject us to various risks.. From time to time we may use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates on loans secured by our assets and investments in collateralized mortgage-backed securities. Derivative instruments include interest rate. 19. swap contracts, interest rate cap or floor contracts, futures or forward contracts, options, or repurchase agreements. Our actual hedging decisions are determined in light of the facts and circumstances existing at the time of the hedge and may differ from time to time.  There is no assurance that our hedging activities will have a positive impact on our results of operations or financial condition. We might be subject to costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs, if we terminate these arrangements.. To the extent that we use derivative financial instruments to hedge against interest rate fluctuations, we are exposed to credit risk, basis risk, and legal enforceability risks. In this context, credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. If the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, which creates credit risk for us. Basis risk occurs when the index upon which the contract is based is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged asset or liability is based, thereby making the hedge less effective. Finally, legal enforceability risks encompass general contractual risks including the risk that the counterparty will breach the terms of, or fail to perform its obligations under, the derivative contract.  Further, the REIT provisions of the Code may limit our ability to hedge the risks inherent to our operations. We may be unable to manage these risks effectively.. We may enter into derivative contracts that could expose us to contingent liabilities in the future.. Derivative financial instruments may require us to fund cash payments upon the early termination of a derivative agreement caused by an event of default or other early termination event. The amount due would be equal to the unrealized loss of the open swap positions with the respective counterparty and could also include other fees and charges. In addition, some of these derivative arrangements may require that we maintain specified percentages of cash collateral with the counterparty to fund potential liabilities under the derivative contract. We may have to make cash payments in order to maintain the required percentage of collateral with the counterparty. These economic losses would be reflected in our results of operations, and our ability to fund these obligations would depend on the liquidity of our respective assets and access to capital at the time.. Volatility in the financial markets and challenging economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt financing on attractive terms and our ability to service any future indebtedness that we may incur.. If the overall cost of borrowing increases, either by increases in the index rates or by increases in lender spreads, the increased cost may result in future refinancing or acquisitions generating lower overall economic returns. Disruptions in the debt markets negatively impact our ability to borrow monies to finance the purchase of, or other activities related to, real estate assets. We may not be able to borrow monies on terms and conditions that we find acceptable or at all. In addition, we may find it costly to refinance indebtedness which is maturing.. Further, economic conditions could negatively impact commercial real estate fundamentals and may cause declines in our occupancy and rental rates as well as in the overall value of our real estate assets.. Risks Related to Our Common Stock. There is no assurance that an active market can be sustained for our shares of common stock or regarding the prices at which our shares may trade.. Our shares of common stock were listed on the NYSE in July 2015.  Listing on the NYSE does not ensure that an active market can be sustained for our common stock.  It is possible that the daily trading volumes for our common stock may be relatively small compared to other publicly traded securities. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to (1) the likelihood that an active market for the stock will develop and be sustained, (2) the liquidity of any such market, (3) the ability of our stockholders to sell their common stock or (4) the price that our stockholders may obtain for their common stock. Even if an active trading market develops, the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. We cannot predict the prices at which our shares will trade.. The market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.. The trading price of our common stock may be volatile. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include:. • actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or distributions;. • changes in our earnings estimates;. 20. • publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry;. • increases in market interest rates that lead purchasers of our shares to demand a higher yield;. • changes in market valuations of similar companies;. • adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future;. • additions or departures of key management personnel;. • actions by institutional stockholders;. • speculation in the press or investment community;. • the realization of any of the other risk factors presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in our other public filings;. • the extent of investor interest in our securities;. • the general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate based companies;. • our underlying asset value;. • investor confidence in the stock and bond markets generally;. • changes in tax laws;. • future equity issuances or the perception that such equity issuances may occur;. • failure to meet earnings estimates;. • failure to maintain our status as a REIT; and. • general market, economic, and political conditions.. The availability, timing, and amount of any cash distributions are uncertain.. Our board of directors reinstated quarterly cash distributions beginning in the second quarter of 2015, at $0.18 per share per quarter, and authorized cash distributions in the same amount for each quarter since that time. We anticipate that the board of directors will continue to consider authorizing a quarterly distribution payable from cash anticipated to be provided by operations.  We can provide no assurance, however, regarding the availability, timing, or amount of any cash distributions. Distributions are authorized at the discretion of our board of directors based on its analysis of our forthcoming cash needs, earnings, cash flow, anticipated cash flow, capital expenditure requirements, cash on hand, general financial condition, and other factors that our board deems relevant. Our board also considers the requirements necessary to maintain our REIT status under the Code.. Our business and operations could be adversely affected if we are subject to stockholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense and impact the market price of our common stock.. In recent years, proxy contests and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies. Stockholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and our board of directors and resources from our business. Activist campaigns can create perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership and may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and harm our ability to attract new investors, tenants, joint venture partners and employees.  In addition, we may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to any activist stockholder matters.  Further, the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks, and uncertainties of any stockholder activism.. 21. Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure. Stockholders have limited control over changes in our policies and operations, and our investment and business strategies and objectives may not be successful.. Our board of directors determines our major policies, including those regarding investment and business policies and strategies, financing, growth, debt capitalization, REIT qualification, and distributions.  Our board of directors may amend or revise certain of these and other policies without a vote of the stockholders. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our investment or business strategies, including our strategies and objectives for 2018.. Your percentage interest in TIER REIT, Inc. will be reduced if we issue additional shares.. Existing stockholders do not have preemptive rights to any shares issued by us in the future. Our charter currently has authorized 400,000,000 shares of capital stock of which 382,499,000 shares are designated as common stock, 1,000 shares are designated as convertible stock, and 17,500,000 shares are designated as preferred stock.  Subject to any preferential rights in favor of any class of preferred stock, our board of directors may increase the number of authorized shares of capital stock that we have the authority to issue or increase or decrease the number of shares of equity stock of any class or series of stock designated.  Shares may be issued at the discretion of our board of directors.  The percentage of our outstanding shares owned by stockholders at the time of any issuance will likely be reduced if we (1) issue or sell additional shares of our common stock in the future; (2) sell securities that are convertible into shares of our common stock; (3) issue shares of our common stock in a private offering of securities; (4) issue shares of our common stock upon issuance of restricted stock or other awards under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan to our independent directors, employees, or consultants; or (5) issue shares of our common stock to sellers of properties acquired by us in connection with an exchange of limited partnership interests of Tier OP.  In addition, the partnership agreement for Tier OP contains provisions that would allow, under certain circumstances, other entities to merge into, or cause the exchange or conversion of their interest for interests of, Tier OP.  Because the limited partnership interests of Tier OP may be exchanged for shares of our common stock, any merger, exchange or conversion between Tier OP and another entity ultimately could result in the issuance of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, therefore reducing the number of outstanding shares owned by our other stockholders. Further, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of stock with terms and conditions that subordinate the rights of the current holders of our common stock or have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of us, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a liquidity event for our stockholders.. A limit on the number of shares a person may own may discourage a takeover.. Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our board of directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT. Unless exempted by our board of directors, no person or group may own more than 9.8% of our outstanding common or preferred stock, in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive. This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of us, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might otherwise provide stockholders with a liquidity event.. Maryland law prohibits certain business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us to be acquired.. Under Maryland law, \"business combinations\" between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the holder becomes an \"interested stockholder.\"  These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities. An \"interested stockholder\" is defined as:. • any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of the then outstanding voting stock of the corporation; or. • an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the then outstanding voting stock of the corporation.. A person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if our board of directors approved, in advance, the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. However, in approving a transaction, our board may condition its approval on compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the board.. 22. After the expiration of the five-year period described above, any business combination between the Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least:. • 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of the then outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation; and. • two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder.. These super-majority voting requirements do not apply if the corporation's common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares. Maryland law also permits various exemptions from these provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors before the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. The business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.. Maryland law limits the ability of a third party to buy a large stake in us and exercise voting power in electing directors.. Maryland law contains a second statute that may also have an anti-takeover effect. This statute, known as the Control Share Acquisition Act, provides that persons or entities owning \"control shares\" of a Maryland corporation acquired in a \"control share acquisition\" have no voting rights with respect to those shares except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the corporation's disinterested stockholders. Shares of stock owned by the acquirer, by officers, or by employees who are directors of the corporation, are not considered disinterested for these purposes.  \"Control shares\" are shares of stock that, taken together with all other shares of stock the acquirer previously acquired, would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power:. • one-tenth or more but less than one-third of all voting power;. • one-third or more but less than a majority of all voting power; or. • a majority or more of all voting power.. Control shares do not include shares of stock the acquiring person is entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval. A \"control share acquisition\" means the acquisition of control shares, subject to certain exceptions. The Control Share Acquisition Act does not apply to (1) shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transaction or (2) acquisitions approved or exempted by our charter or bylaws.  Our bylaws exempt any acquisition by any person of shares of our common stock from the Control Share Acquisition Act.. Our rights, and the rights of our stockholders, to recover claims against our officers and directors are limited.. Maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interest and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. Our charter eliminates our directors' and officers' liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property, or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action. Our charter and bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law for any claim or liability to which they may become subject or which they may incur by reason of their service as directors or officers, except to the extent that the act or omission of the director or officer was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and was committed in bad faith or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, the director or officer actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property, or services, or, in the case of any criminal proceeding, the director or officer had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law, which could reduce our and our stockholders' recovery from these persons if they act in a negligent or grossly negligent manner. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our officers and directors in some cases.. 23. U. S. Federal Income Tax Risks. Failure to qualify as a REIT would adversely affect our operations and our ability to make distributions.. We elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our 2004 tax year. In order for us to remain qualified as a REIT, we must satisfy certain requirements set forth in the Code and maintain other facts and circumstances that are not entirely within our control.. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet, through investments, actual operating results, distributions, and satisfaction of specific stockholder rules, the various tests imposed by the Code. While we intend to structure our activities in a manner designed to satisfy all of these requirements, we cannot assure you that we will satisfy the REIT requirements in the future because qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code as to which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of facts and circumstances not entirely within our control. In addition, new legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualifying as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of qualifying as a REIT.  In the future, we may determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our properties through one or more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as REITs. If any of these subsidiaries fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, then we may also fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.. If we fail to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year, then unless certain relief provisions apply, we will face serious tax consequences that could substantially reduce the funds available for payment of distributions for each of the years involved because:. • we would not be allowed to deduct distributions paid to stockholders when computing our taxable income and we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders;. • we would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax for taxable years ending on or prior to December 31, 2017) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;. • we would become subject to additional state income tax provisions and owe greater amounts of state income tax on our taxable income;. • we would be disqualified from being taxed as a REIT for the four years following the year during which we failed to qualify, unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions; and. • we may be required to borrow additional funds during unfavorable market conditions or sell some of our assets in order to pay corporate tax obligations.. If we fail to qualify as a REIT but are eligible for certain relief provisions then we may retain our status as a REIT but may be required to pay a penalty tax, which could be substantial.. Our investment strategy may cause us to incur penalty taxes, lose our REIT status, or own and sell properties through taxable. REIT subsidiaries, each of which would diminish the return to our stockholders.. It is possible that one or more sales of our properties may be \"prohibited transactions\" under provisions of the Code. If we are deemed to have engaged in a \"prohibited transaction\" (i.e., we sell a property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business), all profit that we derive from such sale would be subject to a 100% penalty tax. While the Code sets forth a safe harbor for REITs that wish to sell property without risking the imposition of the 100% penalty tax, we cannot assure you that we can in all cases comply with the safe harbor or that we will avoid owning property that may be characterized as held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.. Alternatively, if we dispose of property through a TRS, then such a sale may not be treated as a prohibited transaction. However, there may be circumstances that prevent us from using a TRS in a transaction that does not qualify for the safe harbor or circumstances where it may not be clear whether the TRS or the REIT would be treated as the seller for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Additionally, even if it is possible to effect a property disposition through a TRS, we may decide to forgo the use of a TRS in a transaction that does not meet the safe harbor requirements based on our own internal analysis, the opinion of counsel, or the opinion of other tax advisors that the disposition should not be subject to the 100% penalty tax. In cases where a property disposition is not effected (or is not treated as being effected) through a TRS, the IRS might successfully assert that the disposition. 24. constitutes a prohibited transaction, in which event all of the net income from the sale of such property will be payable as a tax and none of the net proceeds from such sale will be available for investment by us or distribution to our stockholders. Moreover, we may then owe additional state income taxes.. Though a sale of the property by a TRS likely would eliminate the danger of the application of the 100% penalty tax, the TRS itself would be subject to tax at the federal level, and very likely at the state and local levels as well, on the gain realized by it from the sale of the property as well as on the income earned while the property is operated by the TRS. This tax obligation would diminish the amount of the proceeds from the sale of such property that would be distributable to our stockholders. As a result, the amount available for distribution to our stockholders would be substantially less than if the REIT had not operated and sold such property through the TRS and such transaction was not successfully characterized by the IRS as a prohibited transaction.. As a REIT, the value of the non-mortgage securities we hold in our TRSs generally may not exceed 20% of the total value of our assets at the end of any calendar quarter.  If the IRS were to determine that the value of our interests in all of our TRSs exceeded this limit at the end of any calendar quarter, then we would fail to qualify as a REIT. If we determine it to be in our best interests to own a substantial number of our properties through one or more TRSs, then it is possible that the IRS may conclude that the value of our interests in our TRSs exceeds 20% of the value of our total assets at the end of any calendar quarter and therefore cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT.  Additionally, as a REIT, no more than 25% of our gross income with respect to any year may, in general, be from sources other than certain real estate-related assets.  Distributions paid to us from a TRS are typically considered to be non-real estate income. Therefore, we may fail to qualify as a REIT if distributions from all of our TRSs, when aggregated with all other non-real estate income with respect to any one year, are more than 25% of our gross income with respect to such year.. Certain fees paid to us may affect our REIT status.. Certain income received by us may not qualify as income from rental of real property for REIT qualification purposes and could be characterized by the IRS as non-qualifying income for purposes of satisfying the \"income tests\" required for REIT qualification. If any of our income were, in fact, treated as non-qualifying, and if the aggregate of such non-qualifying income in any taxable year ever exceeded 5% of our gross revenues for such year (or 5% of any REIT subsidiaries), we could lose our REIT status for that taxable year and the four taxable years following the year of losing our REIT status.  In addition, if income from services we perform for our tenants is determined to be impermissible by the IRS and if that amount exceeds 1% of the property's gross revenues, then all gross revenues from that property will be deemed non-qualifying income for purposes of the 5% amount mentioned above. For example, if a property with $9.0 million of gross revenue has more than $90,000 of impermissible tenant services, all $9.0 million of gross revenue would be treated as non-qualifying income and could adversely affect our REIT status.. If any of our partnerships or limited liability companies are recharacterized by the IRS as taxable corporations, our REIT status would be threatened and the income of such entities would be subject to tax at corporate rates.. If any partnership, limited liability company, or other subsidiary entity that we intend to be classified as a partnership or disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes (including, without limitation, Tier OP and any underlying property owner) is recharacterized by the IRS as a taxable corporation, this may result in our losing REIT status. In addition, the entity would be subject to tax as a corporation, thereby reducing distributions from such entity we ultimately receive.. In certain circumstances, we may be subject to federal and state income taxes as a REIT which would reduce our cash available to pay distributions.. Even if we maintain our status as a REIT, we may yet become subject to federal income taxes and related state taxes.. For example:. • We are subject to tax on any undistributed income. We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions we pay in any calendar year plus amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income, and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years.. • If we have net income from the sale of foreclosure property that we hold primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or other non-qualifying income from foreclosure property, we must pay a tax on that income at the highest corporate income tax rate.. 25. • If we sell a property, other than foreclosure property, that we hold primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, our gain would be subject to the 100% \"prohibited transaction\" tax.. • We will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements between our tenants, our taxable REIT subsidiaries, and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties.. • State laws may change so as to begin taxing REITs.. Legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect stockholders.. The tax laws are complex and are subject to change at any time as a result of legislative, judicial or administrative actions, and these changes may adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder. Any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our shares or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets.. On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law, which makes major changes to the Code, including a number of provisions of the Code that affect the taxation of REITs and their stockholders. The individual and collective impact of these provisions and other provisions of the TCJA on REITs and their stockholders is uncertain, and may not become evident for some period of time. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the implications of the TCJA on their investment in our shares.. We face possible state and local tax audits.. Because we are organized and qualify as a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income taxes, but are subject to certain state and local taxes. In the normal course of business, certain entities through which we own real estate have undergone tax audits. In some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue. Collectively, tax deficiency notices received to date have not been material. However, there can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations."
