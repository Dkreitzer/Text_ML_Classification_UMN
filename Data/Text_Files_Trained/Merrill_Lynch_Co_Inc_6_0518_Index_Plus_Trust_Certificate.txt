[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. In the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to our own businesses. The discussion below addresses the most significant factors of which we are aware that could affect our businesses,. 4. Table of Contents. operations, and financial condition. Additional factors that could affect our financial condition and operations are discussed in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  -  Forward-Looking Statements.\" However, other factors not discussed below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could also adversely affect our businesses, operations, and financial condition. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we may face.. Any risk factor described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any of our other SEC filings could by itself, or together with other factors, materially adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows, competitive position, business, results of operations and financial condition.. General Economic and Market Conditions Risk. Our businesses and results of operations may be adversely affected by the U.S. and international financial markets and economic conditions generally.  Our businesses and results of operations are affected by the financial markets and general economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad, including factors such as the level and volatility of short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, bankruptcies, household income, consumer spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, liquidity of the global financial markets, the availability and cost of capital and credit, investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets, European sovereign debt risks and the strength of the U.S. economy and the non-U.S. economies in which we operate. The deterioration of any of these conditions could adversely affect our business and securities portfolios, our level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets, our capital levels and liquidity and our results of operations.. Continued elevated unemployment, under-employment and household debt, along with continued stress in the consumer real estate market and certain commercial real estate markets in the U.S., pose challenges for domestic economic performance and the financial services industry. The sustained high unemployment rate and the lengthy duration of unemployment have directly impaired consumer finances and pose risks to the financial services industry.  Continued uncertainty in the housing markets and elevated levels of distressed and delinquent mortgages pose further risks to the housing market.  The current environment of heightened scrutiny of financial institutions has resulted in increased public awareness of and sensitivity to financial services industry fees and practices.  Each of these factors may adversely affect our fees and costs.. Liquidity Risk. Liquidity risk is the potential inability to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations, on- or off-balance sheet, as they become due.. Adverse changes to Bank of America's or our credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies could significantly limit our access to funding or the capital markets, increase our borrowing costs, or trigger additional collateral or funding requirements. Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including over-the-counter (\"OTC\") derivatives.. Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings and other securities, including asset securitizations. Following the acquisition of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America, the major credit rating agencies have indicated that the primary drivers of Merrill Lynch's credit ratings are Bank of America's credit ratings. Bank of America's credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies, which consider a number of factors, including Bank of America's financial strength, performance, prospects and operations as well as factors not under Bank of America's control.. On June 21, 2012, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (\"Moody's\") completed its previously-announced review for possible downgrade of financial institutions with global capital markets operations, downgrading the ratings of 15 banks and securities firms, including the ratings of Bank of America and ML & Co.  Bank of America's and ML &. 5. Table of Contents. Co.'s long-term debt ratings were downgraded one notch as part of this action.  Each of the three major rating agencies downgraded the ratings of Bank of America and ML & Co. in late 2011.. Currently, Bank of America's and ML & Co.'s long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies are as follows: Baa2/P-2 (negative) by Moody's; A-/A-2 (negative) by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (\"S&P\"); and A/F1 (stable) by Fitch Ratings (\"Fitch\"). The rating agencies could make further adjustments to Bank of America's (and consequently, our) credit ratings at any time.  There can be no assurance that additional downgrades will not occur.. A further reduction in certain of our credit ratings could negatively affect our liquidity, access to credit markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical. If Bank of America's or Merrill Lynch's (including our bank's or broker dealer subsidiaries') short-term credit ratings were downgraded by one or more levels, we may suffer the potential loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repurchase agreement financing and/or increased cost of funds.. In addition, under the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, in the event of a further downgrade of the credit ratings of ML & Co. or certain subsidiaries, counterparties to those agreements may require ML & Co. or certain subsidiaries to provide additional collateral, terminate these contracts or agreements, or provide other remedies.  At December 31, 2012, if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for ML & Co. or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch, the amount of additional collateral contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements would have been approximately $0.4 billion.  If the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for ML & Co. or certain subsidiaries by a second incremental notch, approximately $4.0 billion in additional incremental collateral would have been required.. Also, if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for ML & Co. or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch, the derivative liability that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties as of December 31, 2012 was $1.9 billion, against which $1.2 billion of collateral has been posted. If the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term debt ratings for ML & Co. or certain subsidiaries by a second incremental notch, the derivative liability that would be subject to unilateral termination by the counterparties as of December 31, 2012 was an incremental $1.3 billion, against which $0.7 billion of collateral has been posted.. While certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable, the full consequences of a credit ratings downgrade to a financial institution are inherently uncertain, as they depend upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related factors and assumptions, including whether any downgrade of a firm's long-term credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its short-term credit ratings, and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers, investors and counterparties.. For a further discussion of our liquidity matters, see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  -  Funding and Liquidity.\". If we or Bank of America are unable to access the capital markets or our borrowing costs increase, our liquidity and competitive position will be negatively affected.  Liquidity is essential to our business. We fund our assets primarily with a mix of secured and unsecured liabilities through a globally coordinated funding strategy with Bank of America. We have established intercompany lending and borrowing arrangements to facilitate centralized liquidity management. As a result, our liquidity risk is derived in large part from Bank of America's liquidity risk. Bank of America's and our liquidity could be adversely affected by any inability to access the capital markets; illiquidity or volatility in the capital markets; unforeseen outflows of cash, including customer deposits, funding for commitments and contingencies; the ability to sell assets on favorable terms; increased liquidity requirements on our banking or nonbanking subsidiaries imposed by their home countries; or negative perceptions about Bank of America's and our short- or long-term business prospects, including downgrades of credit ratings. Several of these factors may arise due to circumstances that neither we nor Bank of America may be able to control, such as a general market disruption, negative views about the financial services industry generally, changes in the regulatory environment, actions by credit rating agencies or an operational problem that affects third parties, us or Bank of America.. 6. Table of Contents. Our and Bank of America's cost of obtaining funding is directly related to prevailing market interest rates and to credit spreads. Credit spreads are the amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury securities, or other benchmark securities, of a similar maturity that we or Bank of America need to pay to funding providers. Increases in interest rates and such credit spreads can significantly increase the cost of funding for us and Bank of America. Changes in credit spreads are market-driven and may be influenced by market perceptions of the creditworthiness of us and Bank of America. Changes to interest rates and credit spreads occur continuously and may be unpredictable and highly volatile.. For additional information about our liquidity, including credit ratings and outlooks, see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  -  Funding and Liquidity.\". Our dependence upon funds from our subsidiaries and our parent could adversely impact our liquidity.  ML & Co. is a holding company that is a separate and distinct legal entity from its parent, Bank of America, and our broker-dealers and other subsidiaries. We evaluate and manage liquidity on a legal entity basis. Legal entity liquidity is an important consideration as there are legal and other limitations on our ability to utilize liquidity from one legal entity to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another, including ML & Co. For instance, ML & Co. depends on dividends, distributions and borrowings or other payments from its subsidiaries and may depend in large part on financing from Bank of America to fund payments on our obligations, including debt obligations. Bank of America may, in some instances, be unable to provide us with the funding we need to fund payments on our obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments to ML & Co. In addition, our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage accounts to fund their businesses. Additional restrictions on related party transactions, increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in brokerage accounts, as well as lower earnings, can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of ML & Co. and even require ML & Co. to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds we need to make payments on our obligations. In addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors.  For additional information about regulatory capital requirements and limitations on our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.. Mortgage and Housing Market-Related Risk. Our mortgage loan repurchase obligations or claims from third parties could result in additional material losses.  In connection with residential mortgage loans sold directly to government sponsored enterprises (the \"GSEs\"), and residential mortgage loans sold to investors other than GSEs as whole loans or private-label securitizations, Merrill Lynch and certain of its subsidiaries made various representations and warranties, breaches of which may result in a requirement that we repurchase the mortgage loans or otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to counterparties.  For example, Merrill Lynch and certain of its subsidiaries,  including First Franklin Financial Corporation (\"First Franklin\"), sold approximately $132 billion in original principal balance of such loans originated from 2004 to 2008 (primarily subprime and alt-A) through private-label securitizations or whole loan sales.  Most of the loans sold in the form of whole loans were subsequently pooled into private-label securitizations sponsored by the third-party buyer of the whole loans.  For the outstanding balance of these loans as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Off-Balance Sheet Exposures - Representations and Warranties - Experience with Non-GSE Investors\" in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.  In addition, Merrill Lynch and First Franklin securitized first-lien residential mortgage loans, generally in the form of mortgage-backed securities (\"MBS\") guaranteed by the GSEs.. At December 31, 2012, the total notional amount of our unresolved representations and warranties repurchase claims from all sources totaled approximately $6.0 billion compared with $1.3 billion at December 31, 2011.  The total amount of our recorded liability related to representations and warranties repurchase exposures was $2.0 billion at December 31, 2012.  We currently estimate that the range of possible loss for representations and warranties exposures could be up to $1.1 billion over accruals at December 31, 2012.  This range of possible loss does not represent a probable loss.  For information concerning the changes to our liability for representations and. 7. Table of Contents. warranties recorded in 2012 and 2011 for our repurchase exposure on private-label securitizations, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.. Our estimated liability and range of possible loss for representations and warranties exposures is based on currently available information and is necessarily dependent on, and limited by, a number of factors, including our historical claims and settlement experience and the experience of our affiliates with non-GSE counterparties, projections of future defaults and, for private-label securitizations, the implied repurchase experience based on the BNY Mellon Settlement (as defined below), as well as significant judgment and a number of assumptions that are subject to change, including the assumption that the conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement are satisfied.  As a result, our liability and estimated range of possible loss related to our representations and warranties exposures may materially change in the future based on factors beyond our control.  Future provisions and/or estimated ranges of possible loss for representations and warranties may be significantly impacted if actual experiences are different from our assumptions in our predictive models, including, without limitation, the ultimate resolution of the BNY Mellon Settlement, estimated repurchase rates, economic conditions, home prices, consumer and counterparty behavior, and a variety of judgmental factors.  In addition, we have not recorded any representations and warranties liability for certain private-label securitizations sponsored by whole-loan investors, where we have little to no claim experience.. Adverse developments with respect to one or more of the assumptions underlying the liability for representations and warranties and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss could result in significant increases to future provisions and/or the estimated range of possible loss.  For example, if courts, in the context of claims brought by private-label securitization trustees, were to disagree with our interpretation that the underlying agreements require a claimant to prove that the representations and warranties breach was the cause of the loss, it could significantly impact the estimated range of possible loss.  Additionally, if recent court rulings related to monoline litigation, including one related to an affiliate of ours, that have allowed sampling of loan files instead of requiring a loan-by-loan review to determine if a representations and warranties breach has occurred, are followed generally by the courts in other monoline litigation, private-label securitization counterparties may view litigation as a more attractive alternative compared to loan-by-loan review.. If future representations and warranties losses occur in excess of our recorded liability and estimated range of possible loss, including as a result of the factors set forth above, such losses could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.. The liability for representations and warranties exposures and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss for these representations and warranties exposures do not consider any losses related to litigation matters disclosed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, nor do they include any potential securities law or fraud claims or potential indemnity or other claims against us. Merrill Lynch is not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss with respect to any such securities law, fraud or other claims against us, except to the extent reflected in the aggregate range of possible loss for litigation and regulatory matters disclosed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; however, such loss could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.. For additional information about our representations and warranties exposure, see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  -  Off-Balance Sheet Exposures  -  Representations and Warranties\" and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.. Our representations and warranties losses could be substantially higher than existing accruals and the existing estimated range of possible loss for representations and warranties liability if court approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement is not obtained or if it is otherwise abandoned.  On June 28, 2011, Bank of America and certain of its non-Merrill Lynch subsidiaries entered into a settlement agreement with The Bank of New York Mellon (\"BNY Mellon\"), as trustee, to resolve, among other claims, all outstanding and potential claims related to alleged representations and warranties breaches (including repurchase claims) with respect to the 525 legacy first-lien and five second-lien non-GSE residential mortgage-backed securitization trusts containing loans principally originated between 2004 and 2008 and for which BNY Mellon acts as trustee or indenture trustee (the \"BNY Mellon Settlement\").  The BNY Mellon Settlement is subject to final court approval and certain other conditions.  Although. 8. Table of Contents. the final court hearings on the settlement are scheduled to begin on May 2, 2013, we cannot currently predict the timing or ultimate outcome of the court approval process, which can include appeals and could take a substantial period of time. There can be no assurance that final court approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement will be obtained, that all conditions will be satisfied (including the receipt of private letter rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\") and other tax rulings and opinions) or, if certain conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement permitting withdrawal are met, that Bank of America and certain of its non-Merrill Lynch subsidiaries will not withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement agreement.. If final court approval is not obtained with respect to the BNY Mellon Settlement, or if Bank of America and certain of its non-Merrill Lynch subsidiaries determine to withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement agreement in accordance with its terms, Merrill Lynch's future representations and warranties losses with respect to non-GSEs could substantially exceed our non-GSE reserve, together with our estimated range of reasonably possible loss for all representations and warranties exposures of up to $1.1 billion over existing accruals at December 31, 2012. Developments with respect to one or more of the assumptions underlying the estimated range of possible loss for representations and warranties (including the timing and ultimate outcome of the court approval process relating to the BNY Mellon Settlement) could result in significant increases in our non-GSE reserve and/or this estimated range of possible loss.  For additional information regarding the BNY Mellon Settlement, see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Off-Balance Sheet Exposures - Representations and Warranties\".. If the U.S. housing market weakens or home prices decline, our consumer loan portfolios, credit quality, credit losses, representations and warranties exposures, and earnings may be adversely affected.  Although U.S. home prices have shown signs of improvement during 2012, the declines over the past several years negatively impacted the credit performance of certain of our portfolios.. Conditions in the U.S. housing market over the past several years also resulted in significant write-downs of asset values in several asset classes, notably mortgage-backed securities and exposure to monolines.  If the U.S. housing market were to weaken, the value of real estate could decline, which could negatively affect our exposure to representations and warranties. While there were  indications in 2012 that the U.S. economy is stabilizing, the performance of our overall portfolios may not significantly improve in the near future. A protracted continuation or worsening of difficult U.S. housing market conditions may exacerbate the adverse effects outlined above and could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. Credit Risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a borrower, obligor or counterparty default when a borrower, obligor or counterparty does not meet its obligations.. Economic or market disruptions, insufficient credit loss reserves or concentration of credit risk, may necessitate an increase in the provision for credit losses, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  When we buy debt securities, loan money, commit to loan money or enter into a letter of credit or other contract with a counterparty, we incur credit risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans or our counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of their agreements. A number of our products expose us to credit risk, including loans, lending commitments, derivatives, trading account assets and assets held-for-sale.  The credit quality of our portfolios has a significant impact on our earnings.. Global and U.S. economic conditions may impact our credit portfolios.  To the extent economic or market disruptions occur, such disruptions would likely increase our credit exposure to customers, obligors or other counterparties due to the increased risk that they may default on their obligations to us.. We estimate and establish an allowance for credit losses for losses inherent in our lending activities (including unfunded lending commitments), excluding those measured at fair value, through a charge to earnings. The amount of allowance is determined based on our evaluation of the potential credit losses included within our loan portfolio. The process for determining the amount of the allowance requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Our ability to assess future economic conditions or the creditworthiness of our customers, obligors or other counterparties is imperfect. We may suffer unexpected losses if the models and assumptions we use to establish. 9. Table of Contents. reserves and make judgments in extending credit to our borrowers and other counterparties become less predictive of future events.  In such an event, we might need to increase the size of our allowance, which reduces our earnings.. In the ordinary course of our business, we also may be subject to a concentration of credit risk in a particular industry, country, counterparty, borrower or issuer. A deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or a failure or downgrade of, or default by, any particular entity or group of entities could negatively affect our businesses, and the processes by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities, industries and countries may not function as we have anticipated. While our activities expose us to many different industries and counterparties, we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment funds and insurers. This has resulted in significant credit concentration with respect to this industry.. In the ordinary course of business, we also enter into transactions with sovereign nations, U.S. states and U.S. municipalities. Unfavorable economic or political conditions, disruptions to capital markets, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies could impact the operating budgets or credit ratings of sovereign nations, U.S. states and U.S. municipalities and expose us to credit risk.. For additional information about our credit risk and credit risk management policies and procedures, see \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  -  Credit Risk Management.\". We could suffer losses and our ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be adversely affected as a result of the actions or deterioration in the commercial soundness of our counterparties and other financial services institutions.  We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients. Financial services institutions and other counterparties are inter-related because of trading, funding, clearing or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to significant future liquidity problems, including losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due us.. Our derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected risks and potential losses.  We are party to a large number of derivatives transactions, including credit derivatives. Our derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected market, credit and operational risks that could cause us to suffer unexpected losses. Severe declines in asset values, unanticipated credit events or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa) may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a derivative instrument. The terms of certain of our OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements provide that upon the occurrence of certain specified events, such as a change in our credit ratings, we may be required to provide additional collateral or to provide other remedies, or our counterparties may have the right to terminate or otherwise diminish our rights under these contracts or agreements.. Many derivative instruments are individually negotiated and non-standardized, which can make exiting, transferring or settling some positions difficult. Many derivatives require that we deliver to the counterparty the underlying security, loan or other obligation in order to receive payment. In a number of cases, we do not hold, and may not be able to obtain, the underlying security, loan or other obligation.. In the event of a further downgrade of the credit ratings of ML & Co. and certain subsidiaries, certain derivative and other counterparties may request we substitute our affiliate, Bank of America, N.A. (\"BANA\") as counterparty for certain derivative contracts and other trading agreements.  Our ability to substitute or make changes to these agreements to meet counterparties' requests may be subject to certain limitations, including counterparty willingness, regulatory limitations on naming BANA as the new counterparty, and the type or amount of collateral required.  It is possible that such limitations on our ability to substitute or make changes to these agreements, including naming BANA as the new counterparty, could adversely affect our results of operations.. 10. Table of Contents. Derivatives contracts and other transactions entered into with third parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties or settled on a timely basis. While a transaction remains unconfirmed or during any delay in settlement, we are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of default may find it more difficult to enforce the contract. In addition, as new and more complex derivatives products have been created, covering a wider array of underlying credit and other instruments, disputes about the terms of the underlying contracts may arise, which could impair our ability to effectively manage our risk exposures from these products and subject us to increased costs.. For additional information on our derivatives exposure, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.. Market Risk. Market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as market volatility. Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, trading account assets and liabilities, and derivatives.. Negative changes in the levels of market volatility and other financial or capital market conditions may increase our market risk.  Our liquidity, cash flows, competitive position, business, results of operations and financial condition are affected by market risk factors such as changes in interest and currency exchange rates, equity and futures prices, the implied volatility of interest rates, credit spreads and other economic and business factors. These market risks may adversely affect, among other things, (i) the value of our on- and off-balance sheet securities, trading assets, and other financial instruments, (ii) the cost of debt capital and our access to credit markets, (iii) the value of assets under management, (iv) fee income relating to assets under management, (v) customer allocation of capital among investment alternatives, (vi) the volume of client activity in our trading operations, (vii) investment banking fees, and (viii) the general profitability and risk level of the transactions in which we engage.  For example, the value of certain of our assets is sensitive to changes in market interest rates.  If the Federal Reserve changes or signals a change in its current mortgage securities repurchase program, market interest rates could be affected, which could adversely impact the value of such assets.. We use various models and strategies to assess and control our market risk exposures but those are subject to inherent limitations. Our models, which rely on historical trends and assumptions, may not be sufficiently predictive of future results due to limited historical patterns, extreme or unanticipated market movements and illiquidity, especially during severe market downturns or stress events. The models that we use to assess and control our market risk exposures also reflect assumptions about the degree of correlation among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators.. In times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, such as the market conditions experienced in 2008 and 2009, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or previously correlated indicators may move in different directions. These types of market movements have at times limited the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and have caused us to incur significant losses, and they may do so in the future. These changes in correlation can be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms that are similar to ours. In these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to the activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations, including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets. To the extent that we own securities that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with such positions.  In addition, challenging market conditions may also adversely affect our investment banking fees.. For additional information about market risk and our market risk management policies and procedures, see \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K.. Further downgrades in the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating, or in the credit ratings of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, could result in risks to Merrill Lynch and its credit ratings and general economic conditions that we are not able to predict.. 11. Table of Contents. On June 8, 2012, S&P affirmed its AA+ long-term and A-1+ short-term sovereign credit rating on the U.S. government.  The outlook remains negative.  On July 10, 2012, Fitch affirmed its AAA long-term and F1+ short-term sovereign credit rating on the U.S. government.  The outlook remains negative.  Moody's also rates the U.S. government AAA with a negative outlook.  All three rating agencies have indicated that they will continue to assess fiscal projections and consolidation measures, as well as the medium-term economic outlook for the U.S.. There continues to be the perceived risk of a sovereign credit ratings downgrade of the U.S. government, including the ratings of U.S. Treasury securities and other government-backed securities.  It is foreseeable that the ratings and perceived creditworthiness of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by institutions, agencies or instrumentalities directly linked to the U.S. government could also be correspondingly affected by any such downgrade. Instruments of this nature are key assets on the balance sheets of financial institutions, including Merrill Lynch, and are widely used as collateral by financial institutions to meet their day-to-day cash flows in the short-term debt market. A downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government and perceived creditworthiness of U.S. government-related obligations could impact our ability to obtain funding that is collateralized by affected instruments, as well as affecting the pricing of that funding when it is available. A downgrade may also adversely affect the market value of such instruments.. We cannot predict if, when or how any changes to the credit ratings or perceived creditworthiness of these organizations will affect economic conditions.  The credit rating agencies' ratings for Bank of America (and consequently, Merrill Lynch) could be directly or indirectly impacted by a downgrade of the U.S. government's sovereign rating because the credit ratings of large systemically important financial institutions currently incorporate a degree of uplift due to assumptions concerning government support.. A downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government or the credit ratings of related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities would significantly exacerbate the other risks to which Merrill Lynch is subject and any related adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our business may be affected by uncertainty about the financial stability of several European Union (\"EU\") countries, the risk that those countries may default on their sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets, the Euro and the EU.  Risks and ongoing concerns about the debt crisis in Europe could have a detrimental impact on the global economic recovery, sovereign and non-sovereign debt in these countries and the financial condition of European financial institutions, and international financial institutions with exposure to the region, including us.  Market and economic disruptions have affected, and may continue to affect, consumer confidence levels and spending, personal bankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence and default on consumer debt and residential mortgages, and housing prices, among other factors. There can be no assurance that the market disruptions in Europe, including the increased cost of funding for certain governments and financial institutions, and the possible loss of EU member states, will not spread, nor can there be any assurance that future assistance packages will be available or, even if provided, will be sufficient to stabilize the affected countries and markets in Europe or elsewhere.  To the extent European economic recovery uncertainty continues to negatively impact consumer confidence and consumer credit factors, or should the EU enter a deep recession, both the U.S. economy and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.. Merrill Lynch has substantial U.K. net deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of net operating losses (\"NOLs\") that are realizable by a few non-U.S. subsidiaries that have a recent history of cumulative losses.  These net deferred tax assets relate to NOLs that may be realized over an extended number of years.  Management has concluded that no valuation allowance is necessary with respect to such net deferred tax assets, based in part on current expectations, including regarding the cessation of certain business activities, changes to capital and funding, forecasts of business activities and the indefinite period to carry forward NOLs.  Significant changes to those expectations, such as would be caused by a substantial and prolonged worsening of the condition of Europe's capital markets, could lead management to reassess its valuation allowance conclusions.. Global economic uncertainty, regulatory initiatives and reform have impacted, and will likely continue to impact, non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios. There can be no assurance our risk mitigation efforts in this respect will be sufficient or successful. Our total sovereign and non-sovereign exposure to Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and. 12. Table of Contents. Spain was $2.9 billion at December 31, 2012.  Our total net sovereign and non-sovereign exposure to these countries was $1.5 billion at December 31, 2012, after taking into account net credit default protection.  At December 31, 2012, the fair value of net credit default protection purchased was $1.4 billion.  Losses could still result because our credit protection contracts pay out only under certain scenarios.. For additional information regarding our direct sovereign and non-sovereign exposures in Europe, see \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk - Credit Risk Management\" in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K.. We may incur losses if the values of certain assets decline.  We have a large portfolio of financial instruments, including, among others, certain corporate loans and loan commitments, loans held-for-sale, repurchase agreements, long-term deposits, trading assets and liabilities, derivatives assets and liabilities, available-for-sale securities and certain other assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value. We determine the fair values of these instruments based on the fair value hierarchy under applicable accounting guidance. The fair values of these financial instruments include adjustments for market liquidity, credit quality and other transaction-specific factors, where appropriate.. Gains or losses on these instruments can have a direct and significant impact on our results of operations, unless we have effectively hedged our exposures. Fair values may be impacted by declining values of the underlying assets or the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the continued availability of these transactions. The financial strength of counterparties with whom we have economically hedged some of our exposure to these assets, also will affect the fair value of these assets. Sudden declines and volatility in the prices of assets may substantially curtail or eliminate the trading activity for these assets, which may make it difficult to sell, hedge or value such assets. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may increase our risk-weighted assets, which requires us to maintain additional capital and increases our funding costs.. Asset values also directly impact revenues in our asset management businesses. We receive asset-based management fees based on the value of our clients' portfolios or investments in funds managed by us and, in some cases, we also receive incentive fees based on increases in the value of such investments. Declines in asset values can reduce the value of our clients' portfolios or fund assets, which in turn can result in lower fees earned for managing such assets.. For additional information about fair value measurements, see Note 4 and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.. Changes in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") or other reference rates may adversely impact the value of debt securities and other financial instruments we hold or issue that are linked to LIBOR or other reference rates in ways that are difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.  In recent years, concerns have been raised about the accuracy of the calculation of the daily LIBOR. The method for determining how LIBOR is formulated and its use in the market going forward may change, including, but not limited to, replacing the administrator of LIBOR, reducing the currencies and tenors for which LIBOR is calculated and requiring banks to provide LIBOR submissions based on actual transaction data or otherwise changing the structure of LIBOR, each of which could impact the volatility of LIBOR. Similar changes may occur with respect to other reference rates. Accordingly, it is not currently possible to determine whether, or to what extent, any such changes would impact the value of any debt securities we hold or issue that are linked to LIBOR or other reference rates, or any loans, derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit we hold or which are due to us, or for which we are an obligor, that are linked to LIBOR or other reference rates, or whether, or to what extent, such changes would impact our financial condition or results of operations.. Regulatory and Legal Risk. Government measures to regulate the financial services industry, including the Financial Reform Act, have increased and will continue to increase our compliance and operating costs and could require us to change certain of our business practices, limit our product offerings, limit our ability to efficiently pursue business opportunities, require an increase to our capital, impact asset values, and reduce our revenues.  As a financial institution, we are heavily regulated at the state, federal and international levels.  Following the financial crisis and related global. 13. Table of Contents. economic downturn, we have faced and expect to continue to face increased public and legislative scrutiny as well as stricter and more comprehensive regulation of our business. These regulatory and legislative measures, either individually, in combination or in the aggregate, could require us to further change our business practices, impose additional costs on us, limit our product offerings, limit our ability to efficiently pursue business opportunities, require an increase to our capital, impact asset values and reduce our revenues.. Federal banking and regulatory agencies have proposed regulations under the Financial Reform Act to limit  proprietary trading as well as the sponsorship of or investment in hedge funds and private equity funds (the \"Volcker Rule\").  The proposed regulations include clarifications to the definition of proprietary trading and distinctions between permitted and prohibited activities.  Although the comment period for these proposed regulations has expired, the regulatory agencies have not finalized the Volcker Rule regulations.. The statutory provisions of the Volcker Rule became effective on July 21, 2012 and gave financial institutions two years from the effective date, with the possibility for extensions for certain investments, to bring activities and investments into compliance with the statutory provisions and final regulations.  Although Merrill Lynch exited its stand-alone proprietary trading business as of June 30, 2011 in anticipation of the Volcker Rule and to further our initiative to optimize our balance sheet, the ultimate impact of the Volcker Rule on us remains uncertain as the regulations implementing the Volcker Rule are not final.  However, based on the content of the proposed regulations, it is possible the Volcker Rule implementation could limit or restrict our remaining trading activities.  If exemptions in the Volcker Rule and the proposed regulations are not available, the Volcker Rule could also limit or restrict our ability to sponsor and hold ownership interests in hedge funds, private equity funds and other subsidiary operations. Additionally, the Volcker Rule could increase our operational and compliance costs, reduce our trading revenues and adversely affect our results of operations.  The date on which final regulations will be issued is currently uncertain.. Additionally, the Financial Reform Act includes measures to broaden the scope of derivative instruments subject to regulation by requiring clearing and exchange trading of certain derivatives; imposing new capital, margin, reporting, registration and business conduct requirements for certain market participants; and imposing position limits on certain OTC derivatives. The Financial Reform Act grants the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \"CFTC\") and the SEC substantial new authority and requires numerous rulemakings by these agencies.  Swaps dealers conducting dealing activity with U.S. persons above a specified dollar threshold were required to register with the CFTC on or before December 31, 2012.  Upon registration, swap dealers became subject to additional CFTC rules relating to business conduct and reporting, and will continue to become subject to additional CFTC rules as and when such rules take effect.. The Financial Reform Act required regulators to promulgate the rulemakings necessary to implement these regulations by July 16, 2011.  However, the rulemaking process was not completed as of that date, and is not expected to conclude until well into 2013.  Further, the regulators granted temporary relief from certain requirements that would have taken effect on July 16, 2011 absent any rulemaking.  The SEC temporary relief is effective until final rules relevant to each requirement become effective.  The CFTC temporary relief largely expired on December 31, 2012. The CFTC also granted relief from some of the rules that would have become effective during the fourth quarter of 2012, either completely suspending or delaying the application of some requirements.. While the CFTC has provided temporary exemptive relief from application of derivatives requirements of the Financial Reform Act for certain non-U.S. derivatives activity, there remains some uncertainty as to how the derivatives requirements of the Financial Reform Act will apply to non-U.S. derivatives activity because the CFTC has not yet adopted final cross-border guidance. The CFTC has completed much of its other rulemakings, with the exception of final margin, capital and exchange trading rules, while the SEC has finalized a small number of clearing-related rules.  The ultimate impact of the derivatives regulations that have not yet been finalized, and the time it will take to comply, continue to remain uncertain. The final regulations will impose additional operational and compliance costs on us and may require us to restructure certain businesses and may negatively impact our results of operations.. 14. Table of Contents. Similarly, in the U.K., the FSA has issued proposed rules requiring the submission of significant information about certain U.K. incorporated subsidiaries and other financial institutions, as well as branches of non-U.K. banks located in the U.K (including information on intra-group dependencies, legal entity separation and barriers to resolution) to allow the FSA to develop resolution plans.  As a result of the FSA review, we could be required to take certain actions over the next several years, which could impose operational costs and potentially result in the restructuring of certain businesses and subsidiaries.. Many of the provisions under the Financial Reform Act have only begun to be implemented or remain to be implemented in the future and will be subject both to further rulemaking and the discretion of applicable regulatory bodies. The Financial Reform Act will continue to impact our earnings through revenue reductions, higher costs and imposition of new restrictions on us. The Financial Reform Act may also continue to have a material adverse impact on the value of certain assets and liabilities held on our balance sheet.  The ultimate impact of the Financial Reform Act on our business will depend on regulatory interpretation and rulemaking, as well as the success of any of our actions to mitigate the negative impacts of certain provisions.. Changes in the structure of the GSEs and the relationship among the GSEs, the government and the private markets, or the conversion of the current conservatorship of the GSEs into receivership, could result in significant changes to our business operations and may adversely impact our business.  Each GSE is currently in a conservatorship, with its primary regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (the \"FHFA\"), acting as conservator. During these conservatorships the FHFA may increasingly converge certain risk management and other standards and practices of each enterprise, which could result in a more uniform market for delivering agency conforming mortgage loans. We cannot predict if, when or how the conservatorships will end, or any associated changes to the GSEs' business structure that could result. We also cannot predict whether the conservatorships will end in receivership. There are several proposed approaches to reform the GSEs which, if enacted, could change the structure of the GSEs and the relationship among the GSEs, the government and the private markets, including the trading markets for agency conforming mortgage loans and markets for mortgage-related securities in which we participate.  We cannot predict the prospects for the enactment, timing or content of legislative or rulemaking proposals regarding the future status of the GSEs. Accordingly, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the future of the GSEs, including whether they will continue to exist in their current form.. We are subject to significant financial and reputational risks from potential legal liability and regulatory action.  We face significant legal risks in our business, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against us and other financial institutions remain high and are increasing. Increased litigation costs, substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could adversely impact our business prospects. In addition, we continue to face increased litigation risk and regulatory scrutiny.  We continue to experience increased litigation and other disputes with counterparties regarding relative rights and responsibilities. Consumers, clients and other counterparties have grown more litigious.  Our experience with certain regulatory authorities suggests a migration towards an increasing supervisory focus on enforcement, including in connection with alleged violations of law and customer harm.  The current environment of additional regulation, increased regulatory compliance burdens, and enhanced regulatory enforcement, combined with ongoing uncertainty related to the continuing evolution of the regulatory environment, has resulted in significant operational and compliance costs and may limit our ability to continue providing certain products and services.. For information concerning certain litigation-related expenses recognized for 2012 and 2011, the estimated aggregate range of possible losses in excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to litigation matters (where an estimate is possible) at December 31, 2012, as well as a further discussion of litigation risks, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.. Our business prospects are vulnerable to changes in governmental fiscal and monetary policy.  Our businesses and earnings are affected by domestic and international fiscal and monetary policy.  The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. and its policies affect our cost of funds for lending, investing and capital raising activities and the return we earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest revenue. The Federal Reserve's actions also can affect the value of financial instruments and other assets, such as. 15. Table of Contents. debt securities, and its policies also can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Our businesses and earnings are also affected by the fiscal or other policies that are adopted by the U.S. government, various U.S. regulatory authorities and non-U.S. governments and regulatory authorities.  Changes in domestic and international fiscal and monetary policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict, but could have an adverse impact on our capital requirements and the costs of running our business.. We may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. and non-U.S. tax and other laws and regulations.  The U.S. Congress and the Administration have signaled interest in reforming the U.S. corporate income tax code.  Possible approaches include lowering the 35% corporate tax rate, modifying the taxation of income earned outside of the U.S. and limiting or eliminating various other deductions, tax credits and/or other tax preferences. It is not possible at this time to quantify either the one-time impact from remeasuring deferred tax assets and liabilities that might result upon tax reform enactment or the ongoing impact reform might have on income tax expense.. In addition, income from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries has not been subject to U.S. income tax as a result of long-standing deferral provisions applicable to income that is derived in the active conduct of a banking and financing business abroad (active finance income). The U.S. Congress has extended the application of these deferral provisions several times, most recently in January 2013. These provisions now are set to expire for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014.  Absent an extension of these provisions, active financing income earned by certain non-U.S. subsidiaries will generally be subject to a tax provision that considers incremental U.S. income tax. The impact of the expiration of these provisions would depend upon the amount, composition and geographic mix of our future earnings.. Other countries have also proposed and adopted certain regulatory changes targeted at financial institutions or that otherwise affect us. The EU has adopted increased capital requirements and the U.K. has (i) increased liquidity requirements for local financial institutions, including regulated U.K. subsidiaries of non-U.K. bank holding companies and other financial institutions as well as branches of non-U.K. banks located in the U.K.; (ii) adopted a Bank Levy, which will apply to the aggregate balance sheet of branches and subsidiaries of non-U.K. banks and banking groups operating in the U.K.; and (iii) proposed the creation and production of recovery and resolution plans by U.K.-regulated entities.. On July 17, 2012, the U.K. 2012 Finance Bill was enacted, which reduced the corporate income tax rate by two percent to 23%.  The first one percent reduction was effective April 1, 2012 and the second will be effective April 1, 2013.  These rate reductions favorably affect income tax expense on future U.K. earnings, but also required us to remeasure our U.K. net deferred tax assets using the lower tax rates.  The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2012 included a $781 million charge for the remeasurement. If the U.K. corporate income tax rate were to be reduced to 21% by 2014, as suggested in U.K. Treasury announcements and assuming no change in the deferred tax asset balance, we would record a charge to income tax expense of approximately $800 million in the period of enactment.  We are also monitoring other international legislative proposals that could impact us, such as changes to corporate income tax laws. Currently, in the U.K., NOL carryforwards have an indefinite life. Were the U.K. taxing authorities to introduce limitations on the future utilization of NOLs and we were unable to document our continued ability to fully utilize our NOLs, we would be required to establish a valuation allowance by a charge to income tax expense.. Risk of the Competitive Environment in Which We Operate. We face significant and increasing competition in the financial services industry.  We operate in a highly competitive environment. Over time, there has been substantial consolidation among companies in the financial services industry, and this trend accelerated in recent years.  This trend has also hastened the globalization of the securities and financial services markets. We will continue to experience intensified competition as consolidation and globalization of the financial services industry may produce larger, better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices. To the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions, we may face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with clients, regulators and industry participants in the relevant market, which could adversely affect our ability to compete. In addition, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally. 16. Table of Contents. were banking products, and for financial institutions to compete with technology companies in providing electronic and internet-based financial solutions. Increased competition may negatively affect our earnings by creating pressure to lower prices on our products and services and/or reducing market share.. Damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses, including our competitive position and business prospects.  Our ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors and employees is impacted by our reputation.  We continue to face increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn, as well as our acquisition by Bank of America and the suitability or reasonableness of recommending particular trading or investment strategies.. Significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources, including indirectly as a result of actions by Bank of America or damage to its reputation, employee misconduct, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, compliance failures, unethical behavior, unintended disclosure of confidential information, and the activities of our clients, customers and counterparties, including vendors.  Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry also can significantly adversely affect our reputation.. We are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protections and other matters.. Principles concerning the appropriate scope of consumer and commercial privacy vary considerably in different jurisdictions, and regulatory and public expectations regarding the definition and scope of consumer and commercial privacy may remain fluid in the future. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied by various jurisdictions in a manner inconsistent with our current or future practices, or that is inconsistent with one another. We face regulatory, reputational and operational risks if personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in our possession is mishandled or misused.. We could suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest. Management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among our clients. The failure to adequately address, or the perceived failure to adequately address, conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us, or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions, which could adversely affect our businesses.. Our actual or perceived failure to address these and other issues gives rise to reputational risk that could cause significant harm to us and our business prospects, including failure to properly address operational risks.  Failure to appropriately address any of these issues could also give rise to additional regulatory restrictions, legal risks and reputational harm, which could, among other consequences, increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties and cause us to incur related costs and expenses.. Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and failure to do so could hurt our business prospects and competitive position.  Our performance is heavily dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Competition for qualified personnel within the financial services industry and from businesses outside the financial services industry has been, and is expected to continue to be, intense. Our competitors include non-U.S.-based institutions and institutions subject to different compensation and hiring regulations than those imposed on U.S. institutions and financial institutions.  The difficulty we face in competing for key personnel is exacerbated in emerging markets, where we are often competing for qualified employees with entities that may have a significantly greater presence or more extensive experience in the region.. In order to attract and retain qualified personnel, we must provide market-level compensation. As a subsidiary of Bank of America, we may be subject to limitations on compensation practices (which may or may not affect our competitors) by regulators in the U.S. or around the world. Any future limitations on executive compensation imposed by legislation or regulation could adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain qualified employees.  Furthermore, a substantial portion of our annual incentive compensation paid to our senior employees has in recent years taken the form of long-term equity awards.  Therefore, the ultimate value of of this compensation depends on the price of Bank of America's common stock when the awards vest.  If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified individuals, our business prospects and competitive position could be adversely affected.. 17. Table of Contents. In addition, if we fail to retain the wealth advisors that we employ in our wealth and investment management business, particularly those with significant client relationships, such failure could result in a significant loss of clients or the withdrawal of significant client assets.. We may not be able to achieve expected cost savings from cost-saving initiatives, including from Project New BAC, or in accordance with currently anticipated time frames.  We are currently engaged in numerous efforts to achieve certain cost savings, including, among other things, Project New BAC.. Project New BAC is a two-phase, enterprise-wide initiative to simplify and streamline workflows and processes, align businesses and costs more closely with Bank of America's overall strategic plan and operating principles, and increase revenues. Phase 1 focused on Bank of America's consumer businesses and related support, technology and operations functions. Phase 2 focuses on businesses and related support, technology and operations functions not subject to evaluation in Phase 1.  All aspects of Phase 1 of Project New BAC are currently expected to be implemented by the end of 2013, with Phase 2 expected to be fully implemented by mid-2015.. We may be unable to fully realize the cost savings and other anticipated benefits from our cost saving initiatives, or  in accordance with currently anticipated timeframes.. Our inability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences could harm our business.  Our success depends on our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards. There is increasing pressure by competitors to provide products and services at lower prices. This can reduce our revenues from our fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services, could require us to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services. We might not be successful in developing or introducing new products and services, responding or adapting to changes in consumer spending and saving habits, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, or sufficiently developing and maintaining loyal customers.. Risks Related to Risk Management. Our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant losses.  Our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us. We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and control our exposure to the types of risk to which we are subject, including strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks, among others. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, those techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Recent economic conditions, heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry and increases in the overall complexity of our operations, among other developments, have resulted in a heightened level of risk for us.  Accordingly, we could suffer losses as a result of our failure to properly anticipate and manage these risks.. A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.  Our business is highly dependent on our ability to process, record and monitor, on a continuous basis, a large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. The potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization, and is not limited to operations functions. Operational risk exposures can impact our results of operations, such as losses resulting from unauthorized trades by employees, and their impact may extend beyond financial losses.. Integral to our performance is the continued efficacy of our internal processes, systems, relationships with third parties and the vast array of employees and key executives in our day-to-day and ongoing operations. With regard to the physical infrastructure and systems that support our operations, we have taken measures to implement backup systems and other safeguards, but our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant and widespread disruption to our infrastructure or systems. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control and adversely affect our ability to process these transactions or provide these services. There could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume;. 18. Table of Contents. electrical or telecommunications outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and cyber attacks. We continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones.. Information security risks for large financial institutions such as Bank of America and Merrill Lynch have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including foreign state actors. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks. We rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, and networks to conduct our operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal smartphones, PCs and other computing devices, tablet PCs, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Our technologies, systems, networks, and our customers' devices have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber attacks, computer viruses, malicious code, phishing attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our customers' confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our customers' or other third parties' business operations.  For example, our websites have been subject to a series of distributed denial of service cyber security incidents. Although these incidents have not had a material impact on Merrill Lynch, nor have they resulted in unauthorized access to our or our customers' confidential, proprietary or other information, because of our prominence, we believe that such incidents may continue.. Although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the prominent size and scale of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch and their roles in the financial services industry, their expanded geographic footprint and international presence, the outsourcing of some of their business operations, the continued uncertain global economic environment, threats of cyberterrorism, and system and customer account conversions.  As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.. In addition, we also face the risk of operational failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions. In recent years, there has been significant consolidation among clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses and increased interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses. This consolidation and interconnectivity increases the risk of operational failure, on both individual and industry-wide bases, as disparate complex systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Any such failure, termination or constraint could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses and could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and customers, or cyber attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities, significant business disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation of our confidential information and/or that of our customers, or damage to our computers or systems and those of our customers and/or counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, and additional compliance costs.. 19. Table of Contents. Risk of Being an International Business. We are subject to numerous political, economic, market, reputational, operational, legal, regulatory and other risks in the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate.  We do business throughout the world, including in developing regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets. Our businesses and revenues derived from non-U.S. jurisdictions are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations, social or judicial instability, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization and/or confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, other restrictive actions, unfavorable political and diplomatic developments and changes in legislation. These risks are especially acute in emerging markets. Many non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we do business have been negatively impacted by recessionary conditions. While a number of these jurisdictions are showing signs of recovery, others continue to experience increasing levels of stress. In addition, the increasing potential risk of default on sovereign debt in some non-U.S. jurisdictions could expose us to substantial losses. Risks in one country can affect our operations in another country or countries, including our operations in the U.S.  As a result, any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on our company.. Our non-U.S. businesses are also subject to extensive regulation by various non-U.S. regulators, including governments, securities exchanges, central banks and other regulatory bodies, in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services and securities industries are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions. Our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could have an adverse effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally.. We also invest or trade in the securities of corporations and governments located in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including emerging markets. Revenues from the trading of non-U.S. securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors. Furthermore, the impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because non-U.S. trading markets, particularly in emerging market countries, are generally smaller, less liquid and more volatile than U.S. trading markets.. In addition to non-U.S. legislation, our international operations are also subject to U.S. legal requirements.  For example, our international operations are subject to U.S. laws on foreign corrupt practices, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and anti-money laundering regulations.  Additionally, we are subject to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which requires a registrant to provide disclosure in its periodic reports and file a notice with the SEC if it or its affiliates knowingly engage in certain activities identified under the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012.  The SEC is required to report any such disclosure to the U.S. President and certain Congressional committees.  The President thereafter is required to initiate an investigation into the reported activity and, within 180 days of initiating such an investigation, determine whether sanctions should be imposed.  If we are required to report any such activities, whether or not any sanctions are actually imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities, our reputation could be harmed and our results of operations could be adversely impacted.. We are subject to geopolitical risks, including acts or threats of terrorism, and actions taken by the U.S. or other governments in response thereto and/or military conflicts that could adversely affect business and economic conditions abroad as well as in the U.S.. Risk from Accounting Changes. Changes in accounting standards or inaccurate estimates or assumptions in applying accounting policies could adversely affect us.  Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations and are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. If those assumptions, estimates or judgments were incorrectly made, we could be required to correct and restate prior-period financial statements.. 20. Table of Contents. Accounting standard-setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\"), the SEC and our independent registered public accounting firm) may also amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various standards should be applied. These changes may be difficult to predict and could impact how we prepare and report our financial statements.  In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in Merrill Lynch needing to revise and republish prior-period financial statements.. On December 20, 2012, the FASB issued a proposed standard on accounting for expected credit losses.  The standard would replace multiple existing impairment models, including replacing an \"incurred loss\" model for loans with an \"expected credit loss\" model.  The FASB announced it will establish the effective date when it issues the final standard.  We cannot predict whether or when a final standard will be issued, when it will be effective or what its final provisions will be.  It is possible that the final standard could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations once it is issued and becomes effective.. For further information on some of our critical accounting policies and standards and recent accounting changes, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.. Risk of Being a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary. We are a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of America and therefore are subject to strategic decisions of Bank of America and affected by Bank of America's performance.  We are fundamentally affected by our relationship with Bank of America. As a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of America, we are subject to a wide range of possible strategic decisions that Bank of America may make from time to time. Those strategic decisions could include the level and types of financing and other support made available to us by Bank of America. In addition, circumstances and events affecting Bank of America can significantly affect us. For example, the primary drivers of our credit ratings are Bank of America's credit ratings, and when rating agencies take actions regarding Bank of America's credit ratings and outlooks, they generally take the same actions with respect to our ratings and outlooks. Also, we have several borrowing arrangements and a globally coordinated funding strategy with Bank of America. Significant changes in Bank of America's strategy or its relationship with us could have a material adverse effect on our business. Material adverse changes in the performance of Bank of America or its other subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are indirectly exposed, therefore, to many of the risks to which Bank of America is directly exposed. Bank of America has not assumed or guaranteed the long-term debt that was issued or guaranteed by ML & Co. or its subsidiaries prior to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America.. As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of America, a bank holding company that is also a financial holding company, we are subject to the oversight of, and inspection by, the Federal Reserve. If Bank of America does not comply with regulatory requirements applicable to banking institutions with respect to regulatory capital, capital ratios and liquidity and required increases in the foregoing, our liquidity would be adversely affected. In order to comply with such requirements, Bank of America may be required to liquidate company assets, among other actions. Our activities are limited to those that are permissible for Bank of America under applicable laws and regulations. As a financial holding company, Bank of America (directly or through its subsidiaries) may engage in activities that are \"financial in nature.\" Bank of America's status as a financial holding company requires, among other conditions, that each of its subsidiary insured depository institutions be well-capitalized and well-managed. Failure to satisfy these conditions may result in the Federal Reserve limiting the activities of Bank of America, which thereby could restrict our current business activities, require divestiture of certain of our assets and operations or limit potential future strategic plans."
