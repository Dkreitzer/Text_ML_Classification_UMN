[1] "ITEM 1A.      RISK FACTORS. The following is a summary of the risk factors that we believe are most relevant to our business.  These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ significantly from anticipated or historical results.  You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.  Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.  We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.  You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosure we make on related subjects in our reports on forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the SEC.. Bankshares is Subject to Interest Rate Risk. Our earnings depend largely on the relationship between the yield on our interest-earning assets and our cost of funds.  This relationship, known as the interest rate spread, is subject to fluctuation and is affected by economic and competitive factors which influence market interest rates, the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the level of non-performing assets.  Fluctuations in market interest rates also affect our customers' demand for our products and services.  See the sections entitled \"Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\" and \"Interest Rate Risk\" in Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to Bankshares' management of interest rate risk.. Bankshares is Subject to Lending Risk. There are inherent risks associated with Bankshares' lending activities.  These risks include, among other things, the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets in which Bankshares operates.  Increases in interest rates and/or weakening economic conditions could adversely affect the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans.  Commercial loans, including commercial real estate loans are typically subject to a higher credit risk than other types of loans, including residential real estate or consumer loans, because they usually involve larger loan balances to a single borrower and are more susceptible to a risk of default during an economic downturn.  Because Bankshares' loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial, construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans.  These types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans.   An increase in nonperforming loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for possible loan losses and an increase in loan charge offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on Bankshares' financial condition and results of operations.  See the section captioned \"Loans\" in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to commercial and industrial, construction and commercial real estate loans.. Bankshares' Allowance for Possible Loan Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Commitments May Be Insufficient. In an attempt to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio, we estimate an allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded commitments based on, among other things, national and regional economic conditions, historical loss experience and delinquency trends.  However, we cannot predict loan and lease losses with certainty, and we cannot assure you that charge-offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded commitments.  If our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded commitments were not sufficient to cover actual loan and lease losses, our earnings would decrease.  In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded commitments and may require additions to the allowance and/or the reserve based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination.  Factors that require an increase in our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded commitments could reduce our earnings.. 13. Bankshares Operates in a Highly Competitive Industry and Market Area. Bankshares faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources.  Such competitors primarily include national, regional, and community banks within the various markets in which Bankshares operates.  Bankshares also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries.  The financial services industry could become even more competitive resulting from legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation.  Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking.  Additionally, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic funds transfer and automatic payment systems.  Many of Bankshares' competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than Bankshares can. Bankshares' ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:.                   The ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets..                   The ability to expand Bankshares' market position..                   The scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands..                   The rate at which Bankshares introduces new products and services relative to its competitors..                   Customer satisfaction with Bankshares' level of service..                   Industry and general economic trends.. Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken Bankshares' competitive position, which could adversely affect Bankshares' growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on Bankshares' financial condition and results of operations.. Bankshares is Subject to Extensive Government Regulation and Supervision. Financial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation in recent years and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future, none of which is within our control.  Significant new laws or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws, including with respect to federal and state taxation, may cause our results of operations to differ materially.  Further, federal monetary policy, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve, significantly affects credit conditions for our affiliated banks, primarily through open market operations in U.S. government securities and the discount rate for bank borrowings and reserve requirements.  A material change in any of these conditions would have a material impact on our results of operations.  Furthermore, failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on Bankshares' business, financial condition and results of operations.  While Bankshares has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur.  See the section captioned \"Supervision and Regulation\" in Item 1 \"Business\" located elsewhere in this report.. Bankshares' Controls and Procedures May Fail or Be Circumvented. Management regularly reviews and updates Bankshares' internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures.  Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system will be met.  Any failure or circumvention of Bankshares' controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on Bankshares' business, results of operations and financial condition.. 14. Bankshares May Not Be Able To Attract and Retain Skilled People. Bankshares' success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people.  Competition for the best people in the business conducted by Bankshares can be intense and Bankshares may not be able to hire people or to retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of Bankshares' key personnel could have a material adverse impact on Bankshares' business because of their skills, knowledge of Bankshares' market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.. Bankshares' Information Systems May Experience an Interruption or Breach in Security. Bankshares relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business.  Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in Bankshares' customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems.  While Bankshares has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed.  The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of Bankshares' information systems could damage Bankshares' reputation, result in a loss of business, subject Bankshares to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose Bankshares to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Bankshares' financial condition and results of operations.. Bankshares Continually Encounters Technological Change. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services.  The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to serve customers better and to reduce costs.  Bankshares' future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in Bankshares' operations.  Many of Bankshares' competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements.  Bankshares may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers.  Failure to keep pace successfully with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on Bankshares' business and, in turn, Bankshares' financial condition and results of operations.. Bankshares is Subject to Claims and Litigation Pertaining to Fiduciary Responsibility. From time to time, customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to Bankshares' performance of its fiduciary responsibilities.  Whether customer claims and legal action related to Bankshares' performance of its fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to Bankshares they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of Bankshares and its products and services as well as affect customer demand for those products and services.  Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on Bankshares' business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on Bankshares' financial condition and results of operations.. Bankshares Relies on Dividends from Its Subsidiaries for Most of Its Revenue. We are a financial holding company and a bank holding company and as a result, much of our income consists of dividends received from our affiliated banks.  This means we rely primarily upon dividends from our affiliated banks to pay dividends to Bankshares' common stockholders.  Federal and state bank regulations restrict the amounts when our affiliated banks pay dividends directly or indirectly to us, when making any extensions of credit to us, when transferring assets to us and when investing in our stock or securities.  These regulations also prevent us from borrowing from our affiliated banks unless the loans are secured by collateral.  In addition, we cannot assure that our affiliated banks will be able to continue to pay dividends to us at past levels, if at all.  If we do not receive sufficient cash dividends or borrowings from our affiliate banks, we may not have sufficient funds to pay dividends on common stock.. 15. Bankshares May Not Be Able to Retain Skilled Personnel in Anticipation of the Planned Merger with PNC. Individual employees may experience uncertainty about their post-merger roles with PNC.  Issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with PNC after the merger may cause them to voluntarily leave Bankshares for other career opportunities.  Loss of significant numbers of employees, or employees in key positions, could have a detrimental impact on Bankshares' ability to carry on certain routine business activities.  There are no assurances that Bankshares will be able to find adequate replacements if they do depart."
