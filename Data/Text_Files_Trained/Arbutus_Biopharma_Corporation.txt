[1] "Item 1A.          Risk Factors. Our business is subject to numerous risks. We caution you that the following important factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC and Canadian securities regulators, press releases, communications with investors and oral statements. All statements other than statements relating to historical matters should be considered forward-looking statements. When used in this annual report, the words \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"plan,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"predict,\" \"may,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"intend,\" \"will,\" \"target,\" \"goal\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this annual report on Form 10-K and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors mentioned in the discussion below will be important in determining future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Actual future results may vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. We explicitly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof, unless required by law. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosure we make in our reports filed with the SEC and Canadian securities regulators.. Risks Related to Our Business. We are in the early stages of our development, there is a limited amount of information about us upon which you can evaluate our Hepatitis B (HBV) candidates and other prospects as well as our delivery technologies.. We have not begun to market or generate revenues from the commercialization of any HBV products and our other delivery technologies. We have only a limited history upon which one can evaluate our business and prospects as our therapeutic products are still at an early stage of development and thus we have limited experience and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biopharmaceutical area. For example, to execute our business plan, we will need to successfully:. • execute research and development activities using our HBV technology; and technologies involved in the development of HBV therapeutics;. • build, maintain and protect a strong intellectual property portfolio;. • gain acceptance for the development and commercialization of any product we develop;. • develop and maintain successful strategic relationships; and. • manage our spending and cash requirements as our expenses are expected to increase due to research and preclinical work, clinical trials, regulatory approvals, and commercialization and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio.. If we are unsuccessful in accomplishing these objectives, we may not be able to develop products, raise capital, expand our business or continue our operations. The approach we are taking to discover and develop novel drug products is unproven and may never lead to marketable drug products.. We intend to concentrate our internal research and development efforts in the future primarily on the discovery and development of therapeutics targeting chronic HBV in order to ultimately develop a cure for the disease. Our future success depends in part on the successful development of these therapeutics. Our approach to the treatment of HBV is unproven, and we do not know whether we will be able to develop any drugs of commercial value.. 20. There is no known cure for HBV. Any compounds that we develop may not effectively address HBV persistence. Even if we are able to develop compounds that address one or more of these key factors, targeting these key factors has not been proven to cure HBV. If we cannot develop compounds to achieve our goal of curing HBV internally, we may be unable to acquire additional drug candidates on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Even if we are able to acquire or develop drug candidates that address one of these mechanisms of action in preclinical studies, we may not succeed in demonstrating safety and efficacy of the drug candidate in human clinical trials. If we are unable to identify suitable compounds for preclinical and clinical development, we will not succeed in realizing our goal of a cure for HBV.. We also intend to continue research and development efforts on RNAi technology and products based on RNAi technology as well as capsid inhibitors and other assets. While RNAi technology is based on a naturally occurring process that takes place inside cells, which can suppress the production of specific proteins, and has the potential to generate therapeutic drugs that take advantage of that process, neither we nor any other company has received regulatory approval to market a therapeutic product based on RNAi technology. The scientific discoveries that form the basis for our efforts to discover and develop new products are relatively new. While there are a number of RNAi therapeutics in development, very few product candidates based on these discoveries have ever been tested in humans and there can be no assurance that any RNAi therapeutic product will be approved for commercial use.. If we are not successful in developing a product with our research and development efforts, we may be required to change the scope and direction of our product development activities. In that case, we may not be able to identify and implement successfully an alternative product development strategy.. We expect to depend in part on our existing collaborators for a significant portion of our revenues and to develop, conduct clinical trials with, obtain regulatory approvals for, and manufacture, market and sell some of our product candidates. If these collaborations are unsuccessful, or anticipated milestone payments are not received, our business could be adversely affected.. We expect that we will depend in part on  our licensing agreements with Alnylam, Gritstone, and Spectrum to provide revenue to fund our operations, especially in the near term. Furthermore, our strategy is to enter into various additional arrangements with corporate and academic collaborators, licensors, licensees and others for the research, development, clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization of our products. We may be unable to continue to establish such collaborations, and any collaborative arrangements we do establish may be unsuccessful, or we may not receive milestone payments as anticipated.. Should any collaborative partner fail to develop or ultimately successfully commercialize any of the products to which it has obtained rights, our business may be adversely affected. In addition, once initiated, there can be no assurance that any of these collaborations will be continued or result in successfully commercialized products. Failure of a collaborative partner to continue funding any particular program could delay or halt the development or commercialization of any products arising out of such program. In addition, there can be no assurance that the collaborative partners will not pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors, as a means for developing treatments for the diseases targeted by our programs.. We expect to spend substantial amounts to acquire additional drug candidates, to conduct further research and development and preclinical testing and clinical trials of our drug candidates, to seek regulatory approvals for our drug candidates and to launch and commercialize any drug candidates for which we receive regulatory approval. These expenditures will include costs associated with our and our subsidiary's licensing agreements with Blumberg or Drexel. Under the terms of these agreements, we are obligated to make significant cash payments upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory and sales performance milestones, as well as royalty payments in connection with the sale of licensed products, to our licensors.. We rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and if they fail to fulfill their obligations, our development plans may be adversely affected.. 21. We rely on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to assist us in managing, monitoring and otherwise carrying out our clinical trials. We have contracted with, and we plan to continue to contract with, certain third parties to provide certain services, including site selection, enrollment, monitoring and data management services. Although we depend heavily on these parties, we do not control them and therefore, we cannot be assured that these third parties will adequately perform all of their contractual obligations to us. If our third-party service providers cannot adequately fulfill their obligations to us on a timely and satisfactory basis or if the quality or accuracy of our clinical trial data is compromised due to failure to adhere to our protocols or regulatory requirements, or if such third parties otherwise fail to meet deadlines, our development plans may be delayed or terminated.. We have no sales, marketing or distribution experience and would have to invest significant financial and management resources to establish these capabilities.. We have no sales, marketing or distribution experience. We currently expect to rely heavily on third parties to launch and market certain of our products, if approved. However, if we elect to develop internal sales, distribution and marketing capabilities, we will need to invest significant financial and management resources. For products where we decide to perform sales, marketing and distribution functions ourselves, we could face a number of additional risks, including:. • we may not be able to attract and build a significant marketing or sales force;. • the cost of establishing a marketing or sales force may not be justifiable in light of the revenues generated by any particular product; and. • our direct sales and marketing efforts may not be successful.. If we are unable to develop our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we will not be able to successfully commercialize our products, if approved, without reliance on third parties.. We will rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture our products (if approved) in commercial quantities, which could delay, prevent or increase the costs associated with the future commercialization of our products.. Our product candidates have not yet been manufactured for commercial use. If any of our product candidates become approved for commercial sale, in order to supply our or our collaborators' commercial requirements for such an approved product, we will need to establish third-party manufacturing capacity. Any third-party manufacturing partner may be required to fund capital improvements to support the scale-up of manufacturing and related activities. The third-party manufacturer may not be able to establish scaled manufacturing capacity for an approved product in a timely or economic manner, if at all. If a manufacturer is unable to provide commercial quantities of such an approved product, we will have to successfully transfer manufacturing technology to a new manufacturer. Engaging a new manufacturer for such an approved product could require us to conduct comparative studies or utilize other means to determine bioequivalence of the new and prior manufacturers' products, which could delay or prevent our ability to commercialize such an approved product. If any of these manufacturers is unable or unwilling to increase its manufacturing capacity or if we are unable to establish alternative arrangements on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, the development and commercialization of such an approved product may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply. Any inability to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities when needed would seriously harm our business.. Manufacturers of our approved products, if any, must comply with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) requirements enforced by the FDA and Health Canada through facilities inspection programs. These requirements include quality control, quality assurance, and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our approved products, if any, may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA, Health Canada, state, and foreign regulatory requirements. We have little control over our manufacturers' compliance with these regulations and standards. A failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of any quantities supplied is compromised due to our manufacturer's failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our products, which would seriously harm our business.. Risks Related to Our Financial Results and Need for Financing. We will require substantial additional capital to fund our operations. If additional capital is not available, we may need to delay, limit or eliminate our research, development and commercialization processes and may need to undertake a restructuring.. 22. Within the next several years, substantial additional funds will be required to continue with the active development of our pipeline products and technologies. In particular, our funding needs may vary depending on a number of factors including:. • revenues earned from our partners, including Alnylam, Gritstone, and Spectrum;. • closure costs associated with our organizational restructuring and expected savings from gains in efficiency:. • the extent to which we continue the development of our product candidates or form collaborative relationships to advance our products;. • our decisions to in-license or acquire additional products or technology for development;. • our ability to attract and retain corporate partners, and their effectiveness in carrying out the development and ultimate commercialization of our product candidates;. • whether batches of drugs that we manufacture fail to meet specifications resulting in delays and investigational and remanufacturing costs;. • the decisions, and the timing of decisions, made by health regulatory agencies regarding our technology and products;. • competing technological and market developments;. • prosecuting and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and. • impact of the potential spin out of certain of Arbutus' assets.. We will seek to obtain funding to maintain and advance our business from a variety of sources including public or private equity or debt financing, collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, licensing our LNP technology, and government grants and contracts. There can be no assurance that funding will be available at all or on acceptable terms to permit further development of our products especially in light of the current difficult climate for investment in biotechnology companies.. If adequate funding is not available, we may be required to delay, reduce or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or reduce expenses associated with non-core activities. We may need to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish most or all of our rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise seek if we were better funded. Insufficient financing may also mean failing to prosecute our patents or relinquishing rights to some of our technologies that we would otherwise develop or commercialize.. We have incurred losses in nearly every year since our inception and we anticipate that we will not achieve sustained profits for the foreseeable future. To date, we have had no product revenues.. With the exception of the years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2012, we have incurred losses each fiscal year since inception until December 31, 2017 and have not received any revenues other than from research and development collaborations, royalties, license fees and milestone payments. From inception to December 31, 2017, we have an accumulated net deficit of $738.1 million. As we continue our research and development and clinical trials and seek regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates, we do not expect to attain sustained profitability for the foreseeable future. We do not expect to achieve sustained profits until such time as strategic alliance payments, product sales and royalty payments, if any, generate sufficient revenues to fund our continuing operations. We cannot predict if we will ever achieve profitability and, if we do, we may not be able to remain consistently profitable or increase our profitability.. We are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our results of operations.. Prior to January 1, 2016, our functional currency was the Canadian dollar. On January 1, 2016, our functional currency changed from the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar based on our analysis of the changes in the primary economic environment in which we operate. As a result, changes in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar could materially impact our reported results of operations and distort period to period comparisons. In particular, to the extent that foreign currency-denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) monetary assets do not equal the amount of our foreign currency denominated monetary liabilities, foreign currency gains or losses could arise and materially impact our financial statements. As a result of such foreign currency fluctuations, it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations. In addition, to the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the trading price of our Common Shares could be adversely affected.. 23. From time to time, we may engage in exchange rate hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Any hedging technique we implement may fail to be effective. If our hedging activities are not effective, changes in currency exchange rates may have a more significant impact on our financial results and the trading price of our common shares.. Changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact our operating results.. Changes in tax laws or regulations could negatively impact our effective tax rate and results of operations. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA). The TCJA introduces significant changes to U.S. corporate income tax law that will have a meaningful impact on our provision for income taxes.  Such changes include, among other things, reducing the marginal U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, introducing a capital investment deduction, limiting the current deduction for net interest expense, limiting the use of net operating losses to offset future taxable income and making extensive changes to the way in which income earned outside the U.S. is taxed in the U.S. Accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA requires significant judgments to be made in interpreting its provisions. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the TCJA, we made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in the financial statements for fiscal year 2017. These provisional amounts are based on the initial analysis of the TCJA. Anticipated guidance from the U.S. Treasury about implementing the TCJA, and the potential for additional guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Financial Accounting Standards Board related to the TCJA, may result in adjustments to these estimates which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations as well as the effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made.. Risks Related to Managing Our Operations. Our planned reorganization, including a site consolidation and organizational restructuring, may cause disruptions in the operation of our business and may not yield the anticipated benefits.. On February 8, 2018 we announced a site consolidation and organizational restructuring to better align our HBV business in Warminster, PA. To achieve this alignment, we will reduce our global workforce by approximately 31% and plan to close our Burnaby facility. We will incur restructuring costs related to one-time employee termination benefits, employee relocation costs, and site closure costs currently estimated to be $5.0 million, which will be primarily paid in cash in the second quarter of 2018.  The reorganization may negatively affect our current business operations, including disrupting clinical development and harming relationships with employees, existing or potential customers, and collaborators.  Further, the restructuring may exceed estimated costs and may not follow the anticipated timeline.  We may not experience the anticipated benefits of the restructuring to the extent expected.. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified key management, scientific staff, consultants and advisors, our ability to implement our business plan may be adversely affected.. We depend upon our senior executive officers as well as key scientific, management and other personnel. The competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense. We rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified managerial, scientific and technical staff. The loss of the service of any of the members of our senior management, including Dr. Mark Murray, our President and Chief Executive Officer, may adversely affect our ability to develop our technology, add to our pipeline, advance our product candidates and manage our operations. We recently experienced turnover in our Chief Financial Officer role and currently have an interim Chief Financial Officer in place. We will be searching for a new, permanent Chief Financial Officer which may prove difficult and may take an extended period of time due to the competition to hire from a limited pool of qualified candidates. This transition period may prove to be disruptive to our business and may inhibit our ability to execute our business plan efficiently. We do not carry key person life insurance on any of our employees.. We rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by other entities and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with those entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates will be limited.. 24. We may have difficulty managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully as we seek to evolve from a company primarily involved in discovery and preclinical testing into one that develops products through clinical development and commercialization.. As product candidates we develop enter and advance through clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, clinical and medical capabilities or contract with other organizations to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various collaborators, suppliers and other organizations. Our ability to manage our operations and growth will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. We may not be able to implement improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems or controls.. We could face liability from our controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials in our research and development processes.. We use certain radioactive materials, biological materials and chemicals, including organic solvents, acids and gases stored under pressure, in our research and development activities. Our use of radioactive materials is regulated by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the possession, transfer, import, export, use, storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials. Our use of biological materials and chemicals, including the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of such materials and certain waste products is regulated by a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling such materials comply with the standards prescribed by such laws and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources. We are not specifically insured with respect to this liability.. Our business, reputation, and operations could suffer in the event of information technology system failures, such as a cybersecurity breach.. We are increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications and computing infrastructure to conduct critical operations. Disruption, degradation, or manipulation of these applications and systems through intentional or accidental means could impact key business processes. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, cybersecurity breaches and other forms of unauthorized access, as well as natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such events could result in exposure of confidential information, the modification of critical data, and/or the failure or interruption of critical operations. For example, the loss of pre-clinical trial data or data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory filings and development efforts and significantly increase our costs. To the extent that any disruption or security breach will result in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the development of our product candidates could be delayed. While we have implemented security measures, including controls over unauthorized access, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from these events. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect data and systems will prevent service interruption or the loss of critical or sensitive information from our or third party providers' databases or systems that could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us or that our insurance would provide any or adequate coverage of any such loss.. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial reports, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price and our ability to raise capital.. A failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results accurately and on a timely basis, which could result in material misstatement in our financial statements, a loss of investor confidence in our financial reporting or adversely affect our access to sources of liquidity. Furthermore, because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls and fraud, even effective internal controls may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Frequent or rapid changes in procedures, methodologies, systems and technology exacerbate the challenge of developing and maintaining a system of internal controls and can increase the cost and level of effort to develop and maintain such systems.. See Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures\" in this Form 10-K for additional information and management's assessment of internal controls.. 25. We rely on and will incur additional expense in connection with our research collaboration with Blumberg.. In June 2016, Arbutus Inc. entered into an amended agreement with Blumberg under which Arbutus Inc. will provide annual funding in the amount of $1.1 million per year through October 29, 2018, and which is renewable for two additional one year terms at our option, for Blumberg to conduct research projects in HBV and liver cancer pursuant to a research plan to be agreed upon by the parties. In exchange, Arbutus Inc. has the right to obtain an exclusive, royalty bearing, worldwide license to intellectual property generated by Blumberg in the course of the funded research and we believe that Blumberg's HBV research platform will continue to be a source of potentially novel hepatitis B targets, drug candidates, assays and other HBV specific technologies. As a result, we are dependent, in part, upon the success of Blumberg in performing its responsibilities under this research collaboration. Blumberg may not cooperate with us or perform its obligations under the agreement. We cannot control the amount and timing of Blumberg's resources that will be devoted to research and development activities related to our research collaboration. Further, development costs associated with our research projects may be difficult to anticipate and exceed our expectations. If funding is unable to continue to financially support the collaboration, if we do not obtain exclusive licenses from Blumberg to the resulting intellectual property, or if we fail to comply with our obligations under those license agreements, its development efforts may be materially harmed.. Risks Related to Development, Clinical Testing and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates. If testing of a particular product candidate does not yield successful results, then we will be unable to commercialize that product candidate.. We must demonstrate our product candidates' safety and efficacy in humans through extensive clinical testing. Our research and development programs are at an early stage of development. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the testing process that could delay or prevent commercialization of any products, including the following:. • decreased demand for our product candidates;. • impairment of our business reputation;. • withdrawal of clinical trial participants;. • costs of related litigation;. • substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;. • loss of revenues; and. • inability to commercialize our product candidates.. Although we currently have product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials for expenses or losses, our insurance coverage is limited to $10 million per occurrence, and $10 million in the aggregate, and may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any or all expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on products that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to fall and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.. The manufacture and sale of human therapeutic products are governed by a variety of statutes and regulations. There can be no assurance that our product candidates will obtain regulatory approval.. To obtain marketing approval, U.S. and Canadian laws require:. • controlled research and human clinical testing;. • establishment of the safety and efficacy of the product for each use sought;. • government review and approval of a submission containing manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical data;. • adherence to Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations during production and storage; and. • control of marketing activities, including advertising and labeling.. 26. The product candidates we currently have under development will require significant development, preclinical and clinical testing and investment of significant funds before their commercialization.  Some of our product candidates, if approved, will require the completion of post-market studies. There can be no assurance that such products will be developed. The process of completing clinical testing and obtaining required approvals is likely to take a number of years and require the use of substantial resources. If we fail to obtain regulatory approvals, our operations will be adversely affected. Further, there can be no assurance that product candidates employing a new technology will be shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials or receive applicable regulatory approvals.. Other markets have regulations and restrictions similar to those in the U.S. and Canada. Investors should be aware of the risks, problems, delays, expenses and difficulties which we may encounter in view of the extensive regulatory environment which affects our business in any jurisdiction where we develop product candidates.. Research and development goals may not be achieved in the time frames that we publicly estimate, which could have an adverse impact on our business and could cause our stock price to decline.. We set goals, and make public statements regarding our expectations, regarding the timing of certain accomplishments, developments and milestones under our research and development programs. The actual timing of these events can vary significantly due to a number of factors, including, without limitation, the amount of time, effort and resources committed to our programs by us and any collaborators and the uncertainties inherent in the clinical development and regulatory approval process. As a result, there can be no assurance that we or any collaborators will initiate or complete clinical development activities, make regulatory submissions or receive regulatory approvals as planned or that we or any collaborators will be able to adhere to our current schedule for the achievement of key milestones under any of our programs. If we or any collaborators fail to achieve one or more of the milestones as planned, our business could be materially adversely affected and the price of our Common Shares could decline.. Recently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our drug candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.. In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval of our drug candidates, restrict or regulate post approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any products for which we obtain marketing approval.. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, was enacted to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Additionally, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, enacted in 2013, imposed new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing.. Members of Congress and the Trump Administration have considered legislation to fundamentally change or repeal the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation to date, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. (TCJA) includes a provision repealing the individual insurance coverage mandate included in the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019. Further, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October 13, 2017, the President signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the Affordable Care Act. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. In addition, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the Affordable Care Act for plans sold through such marketplaces. Congress may consider other legislation to replace elements of the Affordable Care Act. The implications of the Affordable Care Act, its possible repeal, any legislation that may be proposed to replace the Affordable Care Act, or the political uncertainty surrounding any repeal or replacement legislation for our business and financial condition, if any, are not yet clear.. 27. We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal and state legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives in the United States to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop drug candidates.. Legislative and regulatory proposals have also been made to expand post approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. Any healthcare reforms enacted in the future may, like the Affordable Care Act, be phased in over a number of years but, if enacted, could reduce our revenue, increase our costs, or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business. We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the current regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on our business, if any, may be.. Coverage and adequate reimbursement may not be available for our drug candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably.. Market acceptance and sales of any drug candidates that we develop will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third party payors, including government health administration authorities and private health insurers. Third party payors decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Third party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for each of our drug candidates will be made on a plan by plan basis. One payor's determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the product. Additionally, a third party payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Each plan determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a drug, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the drug, and on what tier of its formulary the drug will be placed. The position of a drug on a formulary generally determines the copayment that a patient will need to make to obtain the drug and can strongly influence the adoption of a drug by patients and physicians. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products.. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Third party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Inadequate coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain marketing approval. If coverage and adequate reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any drug candidates that we develop.. Additionally, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in the United States and in some foreign jurisdictions that could affect our ability to sell any future drugs profitably. These legislative and regulatory changes may negatively impact the reimbursement for any future drugs, following approval.. We are subject to U.S. and Canadian healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, curtailment or restricting of our operations and diminished profits and future earnings.. Healthcare providers, physicians and others will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with healthcare providers, patients and third party payors will expose us to broadly applicable U.S. and Canadian fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and collaborative partners through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval.. 28. Efforts to ensure that our collaborations with third parties, and our business generally, will comply with applicable U.S. and Canadian healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental laws and regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, disgorgement, curtailment or restricting of our operations, any of which could substantially disrupt our operations and diminish our profits and future earnings. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations.. Risks Related to Patents, Licenses and Trade Secrets. Other companies or organizations may assert patent rights that prevent us from developing or commercializing our products.. RNA interference and capsid inhibitors as well as our other novel HBV assets are relatively new scientific fields that have generated many different patent applications from organizations and individuals seeking to obtain patents in the field. These applications claim many different methods, compositions and processes relating to the discovery, development and commercialization of these therapeutic products. Because the field is so new, very few of these patent applications have been fully processed by government patent offices around the world, and there is a great deal of uncertainty about which patents will be issued, when, to whom, and with what claims. It is likely that there could be litigation and other proceedings, such as interference and opposition proceedings in various patent offices, relating to patent rights in RNAi, capsid inhibitors and other small molecule compounds targeted at HBV.. In addition, there are many issued and pending patents that claim aspects of RNAi trigger chemistry technology that we may need to apply to our product candidates. There are also many issued patents that claim genes or portions of genes that may be relevant for RNAi trigger drug products we wish to develop. Thus, it is possible that one or more organizations will hold patent rights to which we will need a license. If those organizations refuse to grant us a license to such patent rights on reasonable terms, we will not be able to market products or perform research and development or other activities covered by these patents.. Our patents and patent applications may be challenged and may be found to be invalid, which could adversely affect our business.. Certain Canadian, U.S. and international patents and patent applications we own involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are largely unresolved. For example, no consistent policy has emerged for the breadth of biotechnology patent claims that are granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or enforced by the U.S. federal courts. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued. Also, we face the following intellectual property risks:. • some or all patent applications may not result in the issuance of a patent;. • patents issued may not provide the holder with any competitive advantages;. • patents could be challenged by third parties;. • the patents of others, including Alnylam, could impede our ability to do business;. • competitors may find ways to design around our patents; and. • competitors could independently develop products which duplicate our products.. 29. A number of industry competitors and institutions have developed technologies, filed patent applications or received patents on various technologies that may be related to or affect our business. Some of these technologies, applications or patents may conflict with our technologies or patent applications. Such conflict could limit the scope of the patents, if any, that we may be able to obtain or result in the denial of our patent applications. In addition, if patents that cover our activities are issued to other companies, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses to these patents at a reasonable cost or be able to develop or obtain alternative technology. If we do not obtain such licenses, we could encounter delays in the introduction of products, or could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses is prohibited. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending patent infringement suits brought against us or in filing suits against others to have such patents declared invalid. As publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain we or any licensor was the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or that we or such licensor was the first to file patent applications for such inventions. Any future proceedings could result in substantial costs, even if the eventual outcomes are favorable. There can be no assurance that our patents, if issued, will be held valid or enforceable by a court or that a competitor's technology or product would be found to infringe such patents.. Our business depends, in part, on our ability to use RNAi technology that we have licensed or will in the future license from third parties, including Alnylam, and, if these licenses were terminated or if we were unable to license additional technology we may need in the future, our business will be adversely affected.. We currently hold licenses for certain technologies that are or may be applicable to our current and subsequent product candidates. These include a license to patents held or applied for by Alnylam and a license to UNA technology from Arcturus Therapeutics. The licenses are subject to termination in the event of a breach by us of the license, if we fail to cure the breach following notice and the passage of a cure period. The UBC license, which is sublicensed to Alnylam, is subject to termination with respect to one or more particular patents if we and Alnylam were to cease patent prosecution or maintenance activities with respect to such patent(s), or in the event of a breach by us of the license, if we fail to cure the breach following notice and the passage of a cure period. There can be no assurance that these licenses will not be terminated. We may need to acquire additional licenses in the future to technologies developed by others, including Alnylam. For example, Alnylam has granted us a worldwide license for the discovery, development and commercialization of RNAi products directed to thirteen gene targets (three exclusive and ten non-exclusive licenses). Licenses for the five non-exclusive targets and one exclusive target have already been granted. We have rights to select the gene targets for up to two more exclusive licenses and five more nonexclusive licenses from Alnylam, which would be made available to us only if they have not been previously selected by Alnylam or one of its other partners. This will limit the targets available for selection by us, and we may never be able to select gene targets or may be required to make our selection from gene targets that have minimal commercial potential. Furthermore, future license agreements may require us to make substantial milestone payments. We will also be obligated to make royalty payments on the sales, if any, of products resulting from licensed RNAi technology. For some of our licensed RNAi technology, we are responsible for the costs of filing and prosecuting patent applications. The termination of a license or the inability to license future technologies on acceptable terms may adversely affect our ability to develop or sell our products.. Our business depends, in part, on our ability to use the technology that we have licensed or will in the future license from third parties, including Blumberg, and, if these licenses were terminated or if we were unable to license additional technology we may need in the future, our business will be adversely affected.. We have licensed certain of our intellectual property from Blumberg. Our current technology licenses are important to our business and we expect to enter into additional licenses in the future.  If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements or any future license agreements, we may be subject to a bankruptcy, or if we grant a sublicense in the future and our sublicense does not comply with our obligations under these agreements or becomes subject to a bankruptcy, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to develop or market products covered by the license or may face other penalties under the agreements, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business. In addition, applicable laws involving bankruptcy or similar proceeding by licensors in some jurisdictions outside the United States may provide the trustee or receiver in such proceeding with the right to set aside or otherwise terminate or seek to modify the license. Any termination of these agreements or reduction or elimination of our rights under these agreements may result in our having to negotiate new or amended agreements with less favorable terms, or cause us to lose our rights under these agreements, including our rights to important intellectual property and technologies that form the basis of our technology, which may then be in licensed by one or more of our competitors.. We may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Common Shares to decline.. 30. There has been significant litigation in the biotechnology industry over contractual obligations, patents and other proprietary rights, and we may become involved in various types of litigation that arise from time to time. Involvement in litigation could consume a substantial portion of our resources, regardless of the outcome of the litigation. Counterparties in litigation may be better able to sustain the costs of litigation because they have substantially greater resources. If claims against us are successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, we could be required to obtain a license, grant cross-licenses, and pay substantial milestones or royalties in order to continue to develop, manufacture or market the affected products. Involvement and continuation of involvement in litigation may result in significant and unsustainable expense, and divert management's attention from ongoing business concerns and interfere with our normal operations. Litigation is also inherently uncertain with respect to the time and expenses associated therewith, and involves risks and uncertainties in the litigation process itself, such as discovery of new evidence or acceptance of unanticipated or novel legal theories, changes in interpretation of the law due to decisions in other cases, the inherent difficulty in predicting the decisions of judges and juries and the possibility of appeals. Ultimately we could be prevented from commercializing a product or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations as a result of claims of patent infringement or violation of other intellectual property rights and the costs associated with litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results and could cause the market value of our Common Shares to decline.. Confidentiality agreements with employees and others, including collaborators, may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.. Much of our know-how and technology may constitute trade secrets. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. In order to protect our proprietary technology and processes, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees, vendors, consultants, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers, and other advisors. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such party. Costly and time consuming litigation could continue to be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.. We have licensed important portions of our intellectual property from Blumberg and Drexel, and are subject to significant obligations under those license agreements.. The rights we hold under our license agreements with Blumberg and Drexel are important to our business. Our discovery and development platform is built, in part, around patents exclusively in licensed from these parties.. We have licenses with Blumberg and Drexel, both directly and through its acquisition of Enantigen, that grant us the exclusive (except in some cases as to know how that is not unique or specific to the licensed products or compound series, which are non-exclusive and subject to retained rights for non-commercial research use), worldwide license to make, have made, use, import, offer for sale and sell products incorporating one or more licensed compounds, which include capsid assembly inhibitors, inhibitors of secretion of HBV antigens, cccDNA inhibitors and hepatocellular carcinoma inhibitors, either for general use in humans or for use in the field of HBV research, diagnosis and treatment.. Under our agreements with Blumberg and Drexel, we are subject to significant obligations, including diligence obligations with respect to development and commercialization activities, payment obligations upon achievement of certain milestones and royalties on product sales, as well as other material obligations. Under our direct agreement with Blumberg and Drexel, we agreed to pay up to $3.5 million in development and regulatory milestones per licensed compound series, up to $92.5 million in sales performance milestones per licensed product, and royalties in the mid-single digits in connection with the sale of licensed products. Under each of the three license agreements that our subsidiary, Enantigen, has with Blumberg and Drexel, we are obligated to pay up to $0.5 million in development and regulatory milestones per licensed product and royalties in the low single digits in connection with the sale of licensed products. If these payments become due under the terms of the agreements, we may be negatively affected.. If there is any conflict, dispute, disagreement or issue of non-performance between us and Blumberg and Drexel regarding our rights or obligations under these license agreements, including any conflict, dispute or disagreement arising from our failure to satisfy diligence or payment obligations under such agreements, Blumberg and Drexel may have a right to terminate the license. The loss of any of these license agreements could materially and adversely affect our ability to use intellectual property that could be critical to our drug discovery and development efforts, as well as our ability to enter into future collaboration, licensing and/or marketing agreements for one or more affected drug candidates or development programs.. 31. Some of our licensors have retained rights to develop and commercialize certain of our drug candidates to treat diseases other than HBV and, as a result, our development and commercialization efforts may be negatively affected.. Our license agreements provide us with the rights to develop and commercialize our drug candidates for HBV; however, some of our licensors have retained rights to develop and commercialize certain of its drug candidates to treat diseases other than HBV, and to license those rights to other third parties.. Risks Related to Competition. The pharmaceutical market is intensely competitive. If we are unable to compete effectively with existing drugs, new treatment methods and new technologies, we may be unable to successfully commercialize any product candidates that we develop.. The pharmaceutical market is intensely competitive and rapidly changing. Many large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are pursuing the development of novel drugs for the same diseases that we are targeting or expect to target. Many of our competitors have:. • much greater financial, technical and human resources than we have at every stage of the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization process;. • more extensive experience in pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and in manufacturing, marketing and selling pharmaceutical products;. • product candidates that are based on previously tested or accepted technologies;. • products that have been approved or are in late stages of development; and. • collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions.. We will face intense competition from products that have already been approved and accepted by the medical community for the treatment of the conditions for which we are currently developing products. We also expect to face competition from new products that enter the market. We believe a significant number of products are currently under development, and may become commercially available in the future, for the treatment of conditions for which we may try to develop products. These products, or other of our competitors' products, may be more effective, safer, less expensive or marketed and sold more effectively than any products we develop.. We are aware of several companies that are working to develop drugs that would compete against our drug candidates for HBV treatment. As a significant unmet medical need exists for HBV, there are several large and small pharmaceutical companies focused on delivering therapeutics for treatment of HBV. Further, it is likely that additional drugs will become available in the future for the treatment of HBV. We will face competition from other drugs currently approved or that will be approved in the future for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B.. We anticipate significant competition in the HBV market with several early phase product candidates announced. We will also face competition for other product candidates that we expect to develop in the future.. If we successfully develop product candidates, and obtain approval for them, we will face competition based on many different factors, including the following:. • safety and effectiveness of our products;. • ease with which our products can be administered and the extent to which patients and physicians accept new routes of administration;. • timing and scope of regulatory approvals for these products;. • availability and cost of manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities;. • price;. • reimbursement coverage; and. • patent position.. 32. Our competitors may develop or commercialize products with significant advantages over any products we develop based on any of the factors listed above or on other factors. Our competitors may therefore be more successful in commercializing their products than we are, which could adversely affect our competitive position and business. Competitive products may make any products we develop obsolete or uncompetitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our product candidates. Such competitors could also recruit our employees, which could negatively impact our level of expertise and the ability to execute on our business plan. Furthermore, we also face competition from existing and new treatment methods that reduce or eliminate the need for drugs, such as the use of advanced medical devices. The development of new medical devices or other treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting and may target could make our product candidates non-competitive, obsolete or uneconomical.. We face competition from other companies that are working to develop novel products using technology similar to ours. If these companies develop products more rapidly than we do or their technologies, including delivery technologies, are more effective than ours, then our ability to successfully commercialize products will be adversely affected.. We face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies targeting HBV.. As a significant unmet medical need exists for HBV, there are several large and small pharmaceutical companies focused on delivering therapeutics for treatment of HBV. These companies include Gilead Sciences, Johnson and Johnson, Assembly Biosciences, Roche, Replicor, Spring Bank, Alnylam, Arrowhead, ContraVir, Dicerna, Intellia, Cocrystal, and Enanta. Further, it is likely that additional drugs will become available in the future for the treatment of HBV.. We are aware of several companies that are working to develop drugs that would compete against our drug candidates for HBV treatment. Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drug candidates, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those drug candidates in the United States and in foreign countries. Our current and potential future competitors also have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors.. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing, on an exclusive basis, drug candidates that are more effective or less costly than any drug candidate that we may develop.. We will face competition from other drugs currently approved or that will be approved in the future for the treatment of HBV. Therefore, our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to:. • discover, develop and commercialize drugs that are superior to other products in the market;. • demonstrate through our clinical trials that our drug candidates are differentiated from existing and future therapies;. • attract qualified scientific, product development and commercial personnel;. • obtain patent or other proprietary protection for our drugs and technologies;. • obtain required regulatory approvals;. • successfully collaborate with pharmaceutical companies in the discovery, development and commercialization of new drugs; and. • negotiate competitive pricing and reimbursement with third party payors.. The availability of our competitors' products could limit the demand, and the price we are able to charge, for any drug candidate we develop. The inability to compete with existing or subsequently introduced drug candidates would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.. Established pharmaceutical companies may invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in license novel compounds that could make our drug candidates less competitive. In addition, any new product that competes with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and safety in order to overcome price competition and to be commercially successful. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, discovering, developing or receiving FDA approval for or commercializing medicines before we do, which would have a material adverse impact on our business.. 33. Risks Related to the Ownership of our Common Shares. If our stock price fluctuates, our investors could incur substantial losses.. The market price of our Common Shares may fluctuate significantly in response to factors that are beyond our control. The stock market in general has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. The market prices of securities of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been extremely volatile, and have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market fluctuations could result in extreme fluctuations in the price of our Common Shares, which could cause our investors to incur substantial losses.. There is no assurance that an active trading market in our Common Shares will be sustained.. Our Common Shares are listed for trading on the Nasdaq exchange. However, there can be no assurances that an active trading market in our Common Shares on these stock exchanges will be sustained.. We are incorporated in Canada, with our assets and officers located both in Canada and the United States, with the result that it may be difficult for investors to enforce judgments obtained against us or some of our officers.. Arbutus is incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia and some of Arbutus' assets and officers are located outside the United States. While we have appointed National Registered Agents, Inc. as our agent for service of process to effect service of process within the United States upon us, it may not be possible for you to enforce against us or those persons in the United States, judgments obtained in U.S. courts based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws or other laws of the United States. In addition, there is doubt as to whether original action could be brought in Canada against us or our directors or officers based solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws and as to the enforceability in Canadian courts of judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions based upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws.. Conversely, most of Arbutus' directors and officers reside outside Canada, and with the reorganization around Warminster, PA, the majority of Arbutus' physical assets may also be located outside Canada .  While we have appointed Farris, Vaughan, Wills & Murphy LLP as our agent for service of process in Canada, it may not be possible for you to enforce in Canada against our assets or those directors and officers residing outside Canada, judgments obtained in Canadian courts based upon the civil liability provisions of the Canadian securities laws or other laws of Canada.. If we are deemed to be a \"passive foreign investment company\" for the current or any future taxable year, investors who are subject to United States federal taxation would likely suffer materially adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.. We generally will be a \"passive foreign investment company\" under the meaning of Section 1297 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), (a \"PFIC\") if (a) 75% or more of our gross income is \"passive income\" (generally, dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and gains from the disposition of assets producing passive income) in any taxable year, or (b) if at least 50% or more of the quarterly average value of our assets produce, or are held for the production of, passive income in any taxable year. We have determined that we have not been a PFIC for the three taxable years ended December 31, 2017. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. person holds our Common Shares, it would likely result in materially adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences for such U.S. person, including, but not limited to, any gain from the sale of our Common Shares would be taxed as ordinary income, as opposed to capital gain, and such gain and certain distributions on our Common Shares would be subject to an interest charge, except in certain circumstances. It may be possible for U.S. persons to fully or partially mitigate such tax consequences by making a \"qualifying electing fund election,\" as defined in the Code (a \"QEF Election\"), but there is no assurance that we will provide such persons with the information that we are required to provide to them in order to assist them in making a QEF Election.  In addition, U.S. persons that hold Common Shares issuable upon exercise of warrants are generally not eligible to make certain elections available under the Code that are intended to mitigate the adverse tax consequences of PFIC rules with respect to such warrant shares unless such holders also elect to make a deemed taxable sale of their warrant shares. The PFIC rules are extremely complex and investors are urged to consult their own tax advisers to assess the implications of these rules as applicable to their own facts and circumstances.. Our articles and certain Canadian laws could delay or deter a change of control.. 34. Our preferred shares are available for issuance from time to time at the discretion of our board of directors, without shareholder approval. Our articles allow our board, without shareholder approval, to determine the special rights to be attached to our preferred shares, and such rights may be superior to those of our Common Shares.. In addition, limitations on the ability to acquire and hold our Common Shares may be imposed by the Competition Act in Canada. This legislation permits the Commissioner of Competition of Canada to review any acquisition of a significant interest in us. This legislation grants the Commissioner jurisdiction to challenge such an acquisition before the Canadian Competition Tribunal if the Commissioner believes that it would, or would be likely to, result in a substantial lessening or prevention of competition in any market in Canada. The Investment Canada Act subjects an acquisition of control of a company by a non-Canadian to government review if the value of our assets, as calculated pursuant to the legislation, exceeds a threshold amount. A reviewable acquisition may not proceed unless the relevant minister is satisfied that the investment is likely to result in a net benefit to Canada. Any of the foregoing could prevent or delay a change of control and may deprive or limit strategic opportunities for our shareholders to sell their shares.. The exercise of all or any number of outstanding stock options, the award of any additional options, bonus shares or other stock-based awards or any issuance of shares to raise funds or acquire a business may dilute your Common Shares.. We have in the past and may in the future grant to some or all of our directors, officers and employees options to purchase our Common Shares and other stock-based awards as non-cash incentives to those persons. The issuance of any equity securities could, and the issuance of any additional shares will, cause our existing shareholders to experience dilution of their ownership interests.. Any additional issuance of shares or a decision to acquire other businesses through the sale of equity securities may dilute our investors' interests, and investors may suffer dilution in their net book value per share depending on the price at which such securities are sold. Such issuance may cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other shareholders. The dilution may result in a decline in the price of our Common Shares or a change in control.. We do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.. We have not paid any cash dividends to date and we do not intend to declare dividends for the foreseeable future, as we anticipate that we will reinvest future earnings, if any, in the development and growth of our business. Therefore, investors will not receive any funds unless they sell their Common Shares, and shareholders may be unable to sell their shares on favorable terms or at all. We cannot assure you of a positive return on investment or that you will not lose the entire amount of your investment in our Common Shares. Prospective investors seeking or needing dividend income or liquidity should not purchase our Common Shares.. The value of our securities, including our Common Shares, might be affected by matters not related to our operating performance and could subject us to securities litigation.. The value of our Common Shares may be reduced for a number of reasons, many of which are outside our control, including:. • general economic and political conditions in Canada, the United States and globally;. • governmental regulation of the health care and pharmaceutical industries;. • failure to achieve desired drug discovery outcomes by us or our collaborators;. • failure to obtain industry partner and other third party consents and approvals, when required;. • stock market volatility and market valuations;. • competition for, among other things, capital, drug targets and skilled personnel;. • the need to obtain required approvals from regulatory authorities;. • revenue and operating results failing to meet expectations in any particular period;. • investor perception of the health care and pharmaceutical industries;. • limited trading volume of our Common Shares;. • announcements relating to our business or the businesses of our competitors; and. • our ability or inability to raise additional funds.. The concentration of the Common Shares ownership with insiders, as well as director nomination rights held by the largest shareholder, will likely limit the ability of the other shareholders to influence corporate matters.. 35. As of December 31, 2017, executive officers, directors, five percent or greater shareholders, and their respective affiliated entities of the Arbutus beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately ~53% of Arbutus' outstanding Common Shares. As a result, these shareholders, acting together, have significant influence over most matters that require approval by Arbutus' shareholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Corporate actions might be taken even if other shareholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a corporate transaction that other shareholders may view as beneficial.. Further, on October 16, 2017 and January 12, 2018, respectively, Arbutus completed an issuance and sale to Roivant Sciences Ltd. of two tranches of series A participating convertible preferred shares in the capital of Arbutus, for an aggregate of 1,164,000 preferred shares.  The preferred shares do not have voting rights prior to conversion (except as required by applicable law).  The preferred shares plus an amount equal to 8.75% per annum, compounded annually, will initially be convertible into 22,833,922 Common Shares of Arbutus, no par value, which conversion will occur mandatorily four years after issuance.  Assuming conversion of all of the preferred shares held by Roivant, Roivant will hold 38,847,462, or, without further dilution, 49.9% of the outstanding Common Shares in the capital of Arbutus (based on the total number of issued and outstanding Common Shares as at March 31, 2017, but assuming only the conversion of all of the preferred shares into Common Shares).  The ownership by Roivant of these preferred shares and underlying Common Shares will likely further limit the ability of the other shareholders to influence corporate matters.. In addition, at the special meeting of Arbutus' shareholders held on January 11, 2018, the shareholders approved amendments to Arbutus' Articles such that Roivant has the right to nominate a certain number of directors to the board of directors of Arbutus, which right will terminate upon the earlier of (i) October 16, 2019 and (ii) when Roivant no longer meets certain beneficial ownership thresholds.  With respect to the beneficial ownership thresholds, for so long as Roivant has beneficial ownership or exercises control or direction over not less than (i) 30% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares, Roivant has the right to nominate three individuals for election to the board of directors of Arbutus, one of whom must be \"independent\" within the meaning of applicable law and the rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, not including the rules related to the independence of audit committee members; (ii) 20% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares, Roivant has the right to nominate two individuals for election to the board of directors of Arbutus; and (iii) 10% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares, Roivant has the right to nominate one individual for election to the board of directors of Arbutus. For so long as Roivant has the right to nominate one or more directors to Arbutus' board of directors, the total number of directors of Arbutus will not, without the prior written consent of Roivant, be permitted to exceed seven directors, the majority of whom must be \"independent\".. If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about the business of Arbutus, or if they publish negative evaluations, the price of Arbutus' Common Shares could decline.. The trading market for the Arbutus Common Shares may be impacted by the availability or lack of research and reports that third-party industry or financial analysts publish about Arbutus. There are many large, publicly traded companies active in the biopharmaceutical industry, which may mean it will be less likely that Arbutus receives widespread analyst coverage. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover Arbutus downgrade its stock, its stock price would likely decline. If Arbutus does not receive adequate coverage by reputable analysts that have an understanding of Arbutus' business and industry, it could fail to achieve visibility in the market, which in turn could cause its stock price to decline."
