[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. In addition to other information referenced in this report, we are subject to a number of specific risks, which are outlined below. If any of these events occur, our business, financial condition, profitability and the market price of our Class A Common Stock could be materially affected.. Risks Factors Related to Our Markets and Clients. Changes in environmental laws and regulations, or fundamental changes in the operations of government agencies, could reduce demand or impact the timing for our services.. Most of our business is driven by laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment. Any relaxation or repeal of these laws, or changes in governmental policies regarding the funding or enforcement of these laws, may have an adverse impact on our revenues.  Fundamental changes in the operations of government agencies, including significant staffing reductions or changes in processes for awarding contracts, also could reduce or impact the timing of our revenues.  Also, reduced spending by governments may increase competition within our industry which may directly affect future revenue and profits.. As a government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement laws and regulations and government agency audits.  Any violation of these laws could result in economic harm to our operations.. We must comply with federal, state, and foreign laws relating to the procurement and administration of government contracts.  Such laws include the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the Truth in Negotiations Act (TINA), the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), and the Service Contract Act (SCA).  These laws impact how we do business with government clients and can increase the cost of doing business.  In addition, in recent years, government agencies have mandated that their primary contractors utilize a higher portion of small and disadvantaged businesses as subcontractors.. Government agencies such as EPA and the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), as well as numerous state agencies routinely audit government contractors and their performance under specific contracts to determine if a contractor's cost structure is compliant with applicable laws and regulations.  They may question the incurrence of certain costs based on the FAR and CAS and disallow those costs on their contracts.  These audits may occur several years after payment for services has been received.  Historically, we have been able to successfully defend against the disallowance of any significant costs.  However, future audits may uncover instances of noncompliance and result in material disallowances for costs incurred in the future.  Such material disallowances could negatively affect revenue, profits and cash flow.. We depend on municipal, state and federal government work for a significant portion of our revenues.  Inability to win or renew government contracts during procurement cycles could significantly reduce our revenue and profits.. Revenues from all municipal, state and federal government contracts represented 33%, 36% and 27% of total revenues for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.. Government contracts are typically awarded through a highly regulated procurement process.  Some government contracts are awarded to multiple competitors, causing increased competition and downward pricing pressure.  Inability to win or renew government contracts could adversely affect our operations and significantly reduce our revenue and profits.  In addition, if we cannot reduce or control costs associated with these contracts, we may not be able to bid competitively, or unexpected losses on these contracts may occur.. Our clients may be acquired by other entities, or may elect to sell their interest in ongoing projects to other entities.  These transactions would subject us to increased risk of contract terminations or renegotiations.. If our clients sell their interest in ongoing projects or are acquired by other entities, we may not be able to control or influence decisions made by the acquiring company regarding the ongoing contractual relationships of our client, including decisions to terminate existing contracts or to award future contracts.  Such decisions by acquiring companies to terminate existing contracts, or to exclude us when awarding future contracts, could have an adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations.. 12. Table of Contents. Economic uncertainty could affect our public and private sector work.. Poor global and domestic economic conditions could impact the availability of funding for certain private environmental projects.  In addition, governmental budget cuts or delays in governmental spending could defer or halt work on public environmental programs.  These economic uncertainties could adversely affect our operations and significantly reduce our profits.. Risk Factors Related to Our Management of Project Activity. We must be able to accurately estimate and control contract costs to prevent losses on contracts.. We have three basic types of contracts with our clients: time and materials, fixed price and cost-plus.  The percentage of our revenues associated with these contract types are summarized in the following table.. Fiscal Year Ended July 31,          2017        2016        2015                          Time and materials        47    %        50    %        49    %    Fixed price        37          39          43      Cost-plus        16          11          8      Total revenue        100    %        100    %        100    %. We must control direct contract costs in order to maintain acceptable profit margins.  Under cost-plus contracts, which may be subject to various types of ceilings, we are reimbursed for allowable costs plus a negotiated profit.  If costs exceed ceilings or are otherwise deemed unallowable under provisions of the contract or regulations, we may not be reimbursed for all of our costs.  Under fixed price contracts, we are paid a fixed price regardless of the actual costs incurred. Consequently, a profit is realized on fixed price contracts only if we are able to control costs and avoid overruns.  Under time and material contracts, we are paid for our direct labor hours at fixed rates plus reimbursement of allocable other direct costs.  Profitability is dependent on a consistently high utilization of staff and our ability to control our overhead costs.. The use of the percentage of completion method of accounting could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenues and profits.. A portion of our revenues and profit margins are measured and recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting which is discussed further in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The use of this method results in the recognition of revenues and profit margins ratably over the life of a contract. The effect of revisions to revenues and estimated costs is recorded when the amounts are known or can be reasonably estimated. Such revisions could occur in subsequent periods and their effects could be material. Although we have historically been able to make reasonably accurate estimates of work progress, the uncertainties inherent in the estimation process make it possible for actual costs to vary from estimates in a material amount, including reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenues and profits.. Subcontractor performance and pricing could expose us to loss of reputation and additional financial or performance obligations that could result in reduced profits or losses.. We often hire subcontractors for our projects.  The success of these projects depends, in varying degrees, on the satisfactory performance of our subcontractors and our ability to successfully manage subcontractor costs and pass them through to our customers.  If our subcontractors do not meet their obligations or we are unable to manage or pass through costs, we may be unable to profitably perform and deliver our contracted services.  Under these circumstances, we may be required to make additional investments and expend additional resources to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services.  In addition, the inability of our subcontractors to adequately perform or our inability to manage subcontractor costs on certain projects could hurt our competitive reputation and ability to obtain future projects.. 13. Table of Contents. Risk Factors Related to Our Operations. International operations are subject to a number of risks.. Revenues from international operations represented 21%, 21% and 30% of total revenues for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  International operations are subject to a number of risks, including:.   greater counterparty risk, leading to longer collection cycles and potentially uncollectible accounts;.   currency fluctuations;.   logistical and language challenges that affect our ability to effectively communicate with and manage foreign employees;.   exposure to liability and sanctions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;.   exposure to liability and sanctions under laws and regulations established by foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business;.   lack of developed legal systems to enforce our contractual rights;.   volatility in economic and political conditions, particularly in our South American markets;.   civil disturbance, unrest or violence; and.   difficulties in staffing international operations with appropriately credentialed and trained personnel.. Failure to manage these risks effectively may result in harm to our overall operations and significantly reduce our future revenues, earnings and available liquidity.. Failure to attract and retain key employees could impair our ability to provide quality service to clients.. We provide professional and technical services that depend on our ability to attract, retain and train our professional employees to conduct our business and perform our obligations to ensure success.  The experience of our senior management team and other key employees is essential to the success of any company and our ability to retain such talent is crucial to our profitability.  Failure to effectively develop staff and complete succession planning for key senior management roles could adversely affect customer relationships, the quality of work that we complete for our clients and business development efforts.. Our services could expose us to significant liability not covered by insurance.. The services we provide expose us to significant risks of professional and other liabilities.  Our contracts generally require us to maintain certain insurance coverages and to indemnify our clients for claims, damages or losses for personal injury or property damage relating to performance of our duties unless such injury or damage is the result of the client's negligence or willful acts.  Currently, we are able to obtain insurance coverage to meet the requirements of our contracts, subject to certain pollution exclusions.  Additionally, we have an errors and omissions insurance policy that covers our environmental consulting services, including legal liability for pollution conditions resulting therefrom.  Where possible, we require that our clients cross-indemnify us for asserted claims.  There can be no assurance, however, that any such cross-indemnification agreements, together with our general liability insurance and errors and omissions coverage, will be sufficient to protect us against any asserted claim.. We are unable to predict the total amount of all potential liabilities that could arise under contracts with our clients.  While we believe that we hold an appropriate level of coverage, insurance may be inadequate or unavailable in the future to protect us for such liabilities and risks.. Extraordinary events, including natural disasters and terrorist actions, could negatively impact the economies in which we operate or disrupt our operations.. The geographic area of our operations includes regions that have experienced hurricanes, earthquakes and forest fires.  The occurrence of extraordinary events such as these, as well as other natural disasters or terrorist actions, could cause the delay or cancellation of projects, closure of offices, and the evacuation or loss of personnel.  Such events could limit or disrupt markets and our operations, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows.. Failure to establish and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements.. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. As reported in Item 9A of this Annual Report, management identified control deficiencies as of July 31, 2017 related to accounting for income taxes and to management's review controls over the financial statement close process.  Although the deficiencies did not result in a material misstatement of the Company's financial statements, management concluded that there was a reasonable possibility that, if any material misstatement had occurred, it would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis. Therefore, management reported that material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting existed as of July 31, 2017.. If the remedial measures that are designed to address these material weaknesses are insufficient to address the deficiencies, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material errors and misstatements, and we could be required to restate financial results reported in prior periods.. 14. Table of Contents. Risk Factors Related to Our Ownership and Corporate Governance. Management's voting rights could block or discourage a change in control.. Three of EEI's current directors, one of which is also an executive officer, owned or controlled approximately 54% of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock as of September 29, 2017, which has one vote per share while the Class A Common Stock has one-tenth of a vote per share.  In addition, since the Company qualifies for the NASDAQ \"controlled company exception\" (refer to the section entitled \"Corporate Governance and Security Exchange Rules\" included in Part I of this Annual Report), there exists a group of holders of Class B Common Stock, composed principally of certain of the Company's current directors and executive officers and members of their families (the \"CCE Group\"), that controls greater than 50% of the votes that may be cast for any proposal at a shareholders meeting.  This concentration of voting control by the CCE Group may effectively prevent any influence by the holders of Class A Common Stock over matters submitted to a vote by all shareholders.. The Company may receive change in control offers by third parties. Such change in control offers may be declined by the Company's Board of Directors after taking into consideration its obligations to the Company and its shareholders under applicable law.  Alternatively, such offers may be taken to a vote by shareholders, the results of which could be heavily influenced by members of the CCE Group, which could adversely affect the value of outstanding common stock."
