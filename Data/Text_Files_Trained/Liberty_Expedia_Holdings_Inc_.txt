[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. The risks described below and elsewhere in this annual report are not the only ones that relate to our businesses or our capitalization. The risks described below are considered to be the most material. However, there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could have material adverse effects on our businesses. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of the events described below were to occur, our businesses, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.. Factors Relating to Expedia Holdings' Corporate History and Structure. We are a holding company, and we could be unable in the future to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations or meet our other commitments.. On June 13, 2017, we closed a private offering of $400 million aggregate original principal amount of 1.0% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2047 (the \"Debentures\"). Our ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments, including to make debt service payments under the Debentures and any other debt financings that we may enter into in the future, depends upon our ability to access cash. We are a holding company, and our sources of cash include our available cash balances, net cash from the operating activities of our wholly owned subsidiary Bodybuilding, any dividends and. I-16. Table of Contents. interest we may receive from our investments (including Expedia, subject to certain distribution requirements under the terms of the Debentures) and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future. We currently have no plans with respect to any asset sales. The ability of our subsidiaries Bodybuilding and Expedia to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on their individual operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or may become subject.. We do not have direct access to the cash that Expedia generates from its operating activities.. Expedia generated approximately $1,799 million, $1,565 million, and $1,368 million of cash from its operations during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Expedia uses the cash it generates from its operations to fund its investing activities and to service its debt and other financing obligations. We do not have access to the cash that Expedia generates unless Expedia declares a dividend on its capital stock payable in cash, repurchases any or all of its outstanding shares of capital stock for cash (to the extent we were to participate in such repurchase) or otherwise distributes or makes payments to its stockholders, including us; provided, however, under the terms of the Debentures we are obligated to make additional distributions with respect to the Debentures in the event of certain dividends or distributions paid or made by Expedia to its stockholders, which limits our ability to use any such cash we receive from Expedia.. Although during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 Expedia repurchased 2.3 million shares, 4.0 million shares and 0.5 million shares, respectively, spending $294 million, $436 million and $45 million, respectively, we have not participated in these stock repurchases. Further, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, Expedia declared aggregate dividends of $1.16 per share, $1.00 per share and $0.84 per share, respectively. Although we have participated, pro rata, in these dividends, no assurance can be given that Expedia will continue to pay cash dividends at the same rate or at all.. Our company may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.. Bodybuilding, due to its size and nature, would be insufficient to support any significant financing in the future. In addition, although we consolidate Expedia, we do not have ready access to the cash flow of Expedia due to Expedia being a separate public company and the presence of a significant non-controlling interest. Accordingly, our ability to obtain significant financing in the future, on favorable terms or at all, may be limited.  In addition, the availability of capital for our company will be subject to prevailing general economic and credit market conditions, including interest rate levels and the availability of credit generally, and financial, business and other factors, all of which are beyond the control of our company. If debt financing is not available to us in the future, we may obtain liquidity through the sale or monetization of our available for sale securities, or we may issue equity securities. If financing is not available when needed or is not available on favorable terms, our company may be unable to fund investments or debt refinancing, complete acquisitions, repurchase equity or take advantage of business opportunities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of our company. Further, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution.. There is a risk we may become subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940.. We do not believe that we are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \"40 Act\"), based on the following analyses. We were formed for the purpose of effecting the Split-Off and owning and holding our 52.0% voting interest in Expedia and our wholly-owned subsidiary Bodybuilding. We are primarily engaged in the global travel and online commerce industries through Expedia and Bodybuilding.  Our officers and any employees who provide services to us pursuant to the terms of our services agreement with Liberty Media Corporation (\"Liberty Media\") devote their business activities with respect to us to the businesses of these companies. Our interests in Expedia and Bodybuilding comprise substantially all of our assets, and substantially all of our income, if any, is derived from dividends and other distributions made on our equity interests in Expedia and Bodybuilding. Based on these factors, we believe that we are not an investment company under the 40 Act, including under Section 3(b)(1) of the 40 Act. If, at any time, we become primarily engaged, directly or through one or more of our subsidiaries, in a business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities, we could become subject to regulation under the 40 Act. Following any such change in our business, or the termination of the assignment to us of the Diller Proxy, and after giving effect to any applicable grace periods, we may be required to register as an investment company, which could result in significant registration and compliance costs, could require changes to our corporate governance structure and financial reporting, could place limitations on our capital structure and prohibit transactions with affiliates, and could otherwise restrict our activities going forward. In addition, if we were to become inadvertently subject to the 40 Act and failed to register as an investment company in violation of the 40 Act, such violation could subject us to material adverse consequences,. I-17. Table of Contents. including potentially significant regulatory penalties and the possibility that some or all of our contracts could be deemed unenforceable.. We may have a significant indemnity obligation to Liberty Interactive if the Expedia Holdings Split-Off is treated as a taxable transaction.. In connection with the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, Liberty Interactive received an opinion of its tax counsel to the effect that the Expedia Holdings Split-Off will qualify as a tax-free transaction to Liberty Interactive and to the holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock under Section 355, Section 368(a)(1)(D) and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), except with respect to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares. An opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the conclusions expressed in such opinion could be challenged by the IRS, and a court could sustain such challenge. In February 2017, the IRS completed its review of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off and informed Liberty Interactive that it agreed with the nontaxable characterization of the transactions. Liberty Interactive received an Issue Resolution Agreement from the IRS documenting this conclusion.. Even if the Expedia Holdings Split-Off otherwise qualifies under Section 355, Section 368(a)(1)(D), and related provisions of the Code, the Expedia Holdings Split-Off would result in a significant U.S. federal income tax liability to Liberty Interactive (but not to holders of Liberty Ventures common stock) under Section 355(e) of the Code if one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50-percent or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in the stock of Liberty Interactive or in the stock of our company (excluding, for this purpose, the acquisition of our common stock by holders of Liberty Ventures common stock in the Expedia Holdings Split-Off) as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Expedia Holdings Split-Off. Any acquisition of the stock of Liberty Interactive or our company (or any successor corporation) within two years before or after the Expedia Holdings Split-Off would be presumed to be part of a plan that includes the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, although the parties may be able to rebut that presumption under certain circumstances. The process for determining whether an acquisition is part of a plan under these rules is complex, inherently factual in nature and subject to a comprehensive analysis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel described above, Liberty Interactive or we might inadvertently cause or permit a prohibited change in ownership of Liberty Interactive or our company, thereby triggering tax liability to Liberty Interactive.. Prior to the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, we entered into a tax sharing agreement with Liberty Interactive. Under this agreement, Liberty Interactive is generally responsible for any taxes and losses resulting from the failure of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off to qualify as a tax-free transaction; however, we are required to indemnify Liberty Interactive, its subsidiaries and certain related persons for any taxes and losses which (i) result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the breach of certain covenants made by us (applicable to actions or failures to act by our company and our subsidiaries following the completion of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off), or (ii) result from the application of Section 355(e) of the Code to the Expedia Holdings Split-Off as a result of the treatment of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off as part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50-percent or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in the stock of our company (or any successor corporation). Our indemnification obligations to Liberty Interactive, its subsidiaries, and certain related persons are not limited in amount or subject to any cap. If we are required to indemnify Liberty Interactive, its subsidiaries, or such related persons under the circumstances set forth in the tax sharing agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our financial position.. To preserve the tax-free treatment of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, we may determine to forego certain transactions that might have otherwise been advantageous to our company, including certain asset dispositions or other strategic transactions for some period of time following the Expedia Holdings Split-Off. In addition, our indemnity obligation related to the Expedia Holdings Split-Off under the tax sharing agreement might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control transaction for some period of time following the Expedia Holdings Split-Off.. Our company has overlapping directors and officers with Liberty Interactive, Liberty Media, Liberty Broadband Corporation and Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. and is expected to have overlapping directors and officers with GCI Liberty, Inc., which may lead to conflicting interests.. As a result of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, other transactions between 2011 and 2014 that resulted in the separate corporate existence of Liberty Interactive, Liberty Media, Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. (\"TripCo\") and Liberty Broadband Corporation (\"Broadband\"), as well as the completion of the proposed transactions (the \"GCI Transactions\") involving Liberty Interactive and General Communication, Inc. (to be renamed GCI Liberty), certain of the executive officers of our company also. I-18. Table of Contents. serve or will serve as executive officers of Liberty Interactive, Liberty Media, TripCo, Broadband, and GCI Liberty and there are two overlapping directors. With the exception of Liberty Interactive's current ownership of shares of Liberty Broadband's non-voting Series C common stock, which are expected to be held by GCI Liberty after the completion of the GCI Transactions, none of these companies has any ownership interest in any of the others. Our executive officers and members of our company's board of directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at Liberty Interactive, Liberty Media, TripCo, Broadband, GCI Liberty or any other public company have fiduciary duties to that company's stockholders. For example, there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when our company, Liberty Interactive, Liberty Media, TripCo, Broadband or GCI Liberty pursues acquisitions and other business opportunities that may be suitable for each of them. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting more than one of the companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. Our company has renounced its rights to certain business opportunities and our restated charter provides that no director or officer of our company breaches their fiduciary duty and therefore be liable to our company or its stockholders by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to another person or entity (including Liberty Interactive, Liberty Media, TripCo, Broadband and GCI Liberty) instead of our company, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to our company, unless (x) such opportunity was expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company or as a director or officer of any of our subsidiaries, and (y) such opportunity relates to a line of business in which our company or any of its subsidiaries is then directly engaged. In addition, any potential conflict that qualifies as a \"related party transaction\" (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K) is subject to review by an independent committee of the applicable issuer's board of directors in accordance with its corporate governance guidelines. Any other potential conflicts that arise will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind the applicable fiduciary duties owed by the executive officers and directors of each issuer. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with Liberty Interactive, Liberty Media, TripCo, Broadband or GCI Liberty and/or their respective subsidiaries or other affiliates. There can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to our company, Liberty Interactive, Liberty Media, TripCo, Broadband or GCI Liberty or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case where there is no overlapping officer or director.. Our inter-company agreements were negotiated while we were a subsidiary of Liberty Interactive.. We entered into a number of inter-company agreements covering matters such as tax sharing and our responsibility for certain liabilities previously undertaken by Liberty Interactive for certain of our businesses. In addition, we entered into a services agreement with Liberty Media pursuant to which it will provide to us certain management, administrative, financial, treasury, accounting, tax, legal and other services, for which we will pay Liberty Media a services fee. The terms of all of these agreements were established while we were a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Interactive, and hence may not be the result of arms' length negotiations. Although we believe that the negotiations with Liberty Media are at arms' length, the persons negotiating on behalf of Liberty Media also serve as officers of Liberty Interactive, as described above. We believe that the terms of these inter-company agreements are commercially reasonable and fair to all parties under the circumstances; however, conflicts could arise in the interpretation or any extension or renegotiation of the foregoing agreements.. Factors Relating to Expedia Holdings' Businesses. Expedia operates in an increasingly competitive global environment.. The market for the services that Expedia offers is increasingly and intensely competitive. Expedia competes with both established and emerging online and traditional sellers of travel-related services, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tonline and traditional travel agencies, wholesalers and tour operators;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttravel suppliers, including hotels, airlines and car rental companies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsearch engines and large online portal websites;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttravel metasearch websites;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcorporate travel management service providers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmobile platform travel applications;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsocial media websites;. I-19. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tecommerce and group buying websites;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\talternative accommodation websites; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother participants in the travel industry.. Online and traditional travel agencies:    Expedia faces increasing competition from other online travel agencies (\"OTAs\") in many regions, such as The Priceline Group and its subsidiaries Booking.com and Agoda.com, as well as regional competitors such as Ctrip, which in some cases may have more favorable offerings for travelers or suppliers, including pricing and supply breadth. In addition, the global OTA segment continues to consolidate, with certain competitors merging or forming strategic partnerships.  Expedia also competes with traditional travel agencies (operating both offline and online), wholesalers and tour operators for both travelers and the acquisition and retention of supply.. Travel suppliers:    Travel suppliers, may offer products and services on more favorable terms to consumers who transact directly with them. Many of these competitors, such as airlines, hotels and rental car companies, have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites and mobile applications in lieu of third-party distributors such as the various Expedia sites. For instance, several large hotel chains have combined to establish a single online hotel search platform with links directly to their own websites and mobile applications and some low-cost airlines, which are having increasing success in the marketplace, distribute their online supply exclusively through their own websites. In recent years, certain hotel chains have launched advertising campaigns expressly designed to drive consumer traffic directly to their websites. Suppliers who sell on their own websites, in some instances, offer advantages such as favorable rates, increased or exclusive product availability, complimentary Wi-Fi, and their own bonus miles or loyalty points, or in the case of airlines, promote hotel supply at their websites, which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than Expedia's.. Search engines and large online portal websites:    Expedia also faces increasing competition from search engines including Google. To the extent that these leading search engines that have a significant presence in Expedia's key markets disintermediate online travel agencies or travel content providers by offering comprehensive travel planning, shopping or booking capabilities, or increasingly refer those leads directly to suppliers or other favored partners, increase the cost of traffic directed to Expedia's websites, or offer the ability to transact on their own website, there could be a material adverse impact on Expedia's business and financial performance. In recent years search engines have increased their focus on acquiring or launching flight and hotel search products that provide increasingly comprehensive travel planning content and direct booking capabilities, comparable to OTAs. For example, Google has entered various aspects of the online travel market, including by establishing a flight metasearch product and a hotel metasearch product  that are growing rapidly, as well as its \"Book on Google\" reservation functionality. In addition, these search engines continue to expand their voice and artificial intelligence capabilities. To the extent these actions have a negative effect on Expedia's search traffic or the cost of acquiring such traffic, Expedia's business and financial performance could be adversely affected.. In addition, Expedia's websites, or websites in which Expedia holds a significant ownership position, including trivago-branded websites, compete for advertising revenue with these search engines, as well as with large internet portal sites that offer advertising opportunities for travel-related companies. Several of these competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and larger client bases than Expedia. Expedia expects to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the online advertising market. Competition could result in higher traffic acquisition costs, reduced margins on Expedia's advertising services, loss of market share, reduced customer traffic to Expedia's websites and reduced advertising by travel companies on Expedia's websites.. Travel metasearch websites:    Travel metasearch websites, including Kayak.com (a subsidiary of Priceline), trivago (a majority-owned subsidiary of Expedia), TripAdvisor, Inc. (\"TripAdvisor\"), Skyscanner and Qunar (both subsidiaries of Ctrip), aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier, travel agent and other websites. In addition, some metasearch websites have added or intend to add various forms of direct or assisted booking functionality to their sites in direct competition with certain of Expedia's brands. To the extent metasearch websites limit Expedia's participation within their search results, or consumers utilize a metasearch website for travel services and bookings instead of Expedia, Expedia's traffic-generating arrangements could be affected in a negative manner, or it may be required to increase its marketing costs to maintain market share, either of which could have an adverse effect on Expedia's business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of Expedia's majority ownership interest in trivago, Expedia also now competes more directly with other metasearch engines and content aggregators for advertising revenue. To the extent that trivago's ability to aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier, travel agent and other websites is hampered, whether due to its affiliation with Expedia or otherwise, or. I-20. Table of Contents. if OTA advertisers or suppliers choose to limit their participation in trivago's metasearch marketplace, trivago's business and therefore Expedia's results of operations could be adversely affected and the value of Expedia's investment in trivago could be negatively impacted.. Corporate travel management service providers:    Egencia, Expedia's full-service corporate travel management company, competes with online and traditional corporate travel providers, including Carlson Wagonlit and American Express Global Business Travel, as well as vendors of corporate travel and expense management software and services, including Concur. Some of these competitors may have more financial resources, greater name recognition, well-established client bases, differentiated business models, or a broader global presence, which may make it difficult for Expedia to retain or attract new corporate travel clients.. Mobile and other platform travel applications:    The demand for and functionality of smartphones, tablet computers and home assistants continue to grow and improve significantly.  If Expedia is unable to offer innovative, user-friendly, feature-rich mobile applications and mobile-responsive websites for its travel services, along with effective marketing and advertising, or if its mobile applications and mobile-responsive websites are not used by consumers, Expedia could lose market share to existing competitors or new entrants and its future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.. Social media websites:    Social media websites, including Facebook, continue to develop search functionality for data included within their websites and mobile applications, which may in the future develop into an alternative research and booking resource for travelers, resulting in additional competition. Notably, Facebook has launched Dynamic Ads for Travel product, expanding its reach into the travel market.. eCommerce and group buying websites: Traditional consumer eCommerce and group buying websites have periodically undertaken efforts to expand their local offerings into the travel market.  For example, traditional consumer eCommerce and group buying websites may add hotel offers or other travel services to their sites.  To the extent Expedia's travelers use these websites, these websites may create additional competition and could negatively affect Expedia's businesses.. Alternative accommodations:    Airbnb and similar websites that facilitate the short-term rental of homes and apartments from owners provide an alternative to hotel rooms and vacation rental properties available through Expedia websites, including HomeAway. The continued growth of alternative accommodation sources could affect overall travel patterns generally and the demand for Expedia's services specifically in facilitating reservations at hotels and vacation rentals. Furthermore, Airbnb and similar websites have added other travel services, such as tours, activities, hotel and flight bookings, any of which could further extend their reach into the travel market as they seek to compete with the traditional OTAs.. Other participants in the travel industry:    Other participants or existing competitors may begin to offer or expand other services to the travel industry that compete with the services Expedia offers to its travelers, its travel industry affiliates and partners, or its corporate clients.  For example, ride-sharing apps increasingly compete with traditional car rental services and travel services continue to proliferate.  To the extent any of these services gain market share over time, it may create additional competition and could negatively affect Expedia's businesses.. We cannot assure you that Expedia will be able to compete successfully against any current, emerging and future competitors or on platforms that may emerge, or provide differentiated products and services to its traveler base. Increasing competition from current and emerging competitors, the introduction of new technologies and the continued expansion of existing technologies, such as metasearch and other search engine technologies, may force Expedia to make changes to its business models, which could affect its financial performance and liquidity. In general, increased competition has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins, as well as loss of travelers, transactions and brand recognition.. The industry in which Expedia operates is dynamic.. Expedia continues to adapt its business to remain competitive, including investing in evolving channels such as metasearch and mobile, as well as voice search capabilities and offering new consumer choices,  including inventory types and transactional models, and increasing supplier inventory on its existing platforms through acquisitions and partnerships. If Expedia fails to appropriately adapt to competitive or consumer preference developments, its business could be adversely affected. Expedia's attempts to adapt its current business models or practices or adopt new business models and practices in order to compete may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, expenses. I-21. Table of Contents. associated with the initiatives, different legal or tax requirements, inadequate return on investments, difficulties and expenses associated with the integration of acquired brands and their inventory onto Expedia's platforms, as well as limit its ability to develop new site features. In addition, adaptations to Expedia's business may require significant investments, including changes to its financial systems and processes, which could significantly increase its costs and increase the risk of payment delays and/or non-payments of amounts owed to it from its supplier partners and customers. In addition, these new initiatives may not be successful and may harm Expedia's financial condition and operating results.. Expedia and Bodybuilding's respective businesses could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics or other traffic-generating arrangements.. Expedia increasingly utilizes internet search engines such as Google, principally through the purchase of travel-related keywords, to generate a significant portion of the traffic to its websites and the websites of its affiliates. Bodybuilding also uses internet search engines to generate a significant portion of traffic to its websites. Search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user's search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to Expedia's websites and those of its affiliates and Bodybuilding's websites can be negatively affected. In addition, a significant amount of traffic is directed to Expedia's websites and those of its affiliates through participation in pay-per-click and display advertising campaigns on search engines, including Google, and travel metasearch websites, including Kayak, TripAdvisor and trivago.  Similarly, a significant amount of traffic is directed to Bodybuilding's websites through such advertising campaigns on search engines. Pricing and operating dynamics for these traffic sources can change rapidly, both technically and competitively. Moreover, a search or metasearch engine could, for competitive or other purposes, adopt emerging technologies, such as voice, alter its search algorithms or results, which could cause a website to place lower in search query results, or inhibit participation in the search query results. If a major search engine changes its algorithms or results in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking, paid or unpaid, of Expedia's websites and the websites of its affiliates and Bodybuilding's websites, or those of their third-party distribution partners, or if competitive dynamics impact the costs or effectiveness of search engine optimization, search engine marketing or other traffic-generating arrangements in a negative manner, Expedia and Bodybuilding's respective businesses and financial performance would be adversely affected, potentially to a material extent. In addition, with respect to Expedia, certain metasearch companies have added various forms of direct or assisted booking functionality to their sites. To the extent such functionality is promoted at the expense of traditional paid listings, this may reduce the amount of traffic to Expedia's websites or those of its affiliates.. Expedia's business depends on its relationships with travel suppliers and travel distribution partners.. An important component of Expedia's business success depends on its ability to maintain and expand relationships with travel suppliers (including owners and managers of vacation rental properties) and GDS partners. A substantial portion of Expedia's revenue is derived from compensation negotiated with travel suppliers, in particular hotel suppliers, airlines, and GDS partners for bookings made through its websites. Each year Expedia typically negotiates or renegotiates numerous supplier contracts.. No assurances can be given that Expedia's compensation, access to inventory, or access to inventory at competitive rates, will not be further reduced or eliminated in the future, or that travel suppliers will not reduce the cost of their products or services (for example, average daily rates (\"ADRs\") or ticket prices), attempt to implement costly direct connections, charge Expedia for or otherwise restrict access to content, increase credit card fees or fees for other services, fail to provide Expedia with accurate booking information or otherwise take actions that would increase Expedia's operating expenses. Any of these actions, or other similar actions, could reduce Expedia's revenue and margins thereby adversely affecting its business and financial performance.. Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect Expedia's business and financial performance.. Expedia's business and financial performance are affected by the health of the worldwide travel industry. Travel expenditures are sensitive to personal and business-related discretionary spending levels and tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns. Decreased travel expenditures could reduce the demand for Expedia's services, thereby causing a reduction in revenue.. For example, during regional or global recessions, domestic and global economic conditions can deteriorate rapidly resulting in increased unemployment and a reduction in available budgets for both business and leisure travelers, which slow spending on the services Expedia provides and have a negative impact on its revenue growth. Additionally, if individual countries. I-22. Table of Contents. or regions experience deteriorating credit and economic conditions, and/or significant fluctuations of currency values relative to other currencies such as the U.S. Dollar, it can lead to a negative impact on Expedia's foreign denominated net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses, and net income as expressed in U.S. Dollars. Further economic weakness and uncertainty may result in significantly decreased spending on Expedia's services by both business and leisure travelers, which may have a material adverse impact on its business and financial performance. Political instability, including as a result of the recent United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union, bans on travel from certain countries to the United States, geopolitical conflicts, significant fluctuations in currency values, sovereign debt issues, and macroeconomic concerns are examples of events that contribute to a somewhat uncertain economic environment, which could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future.. Expedia's business is also sensitive to fluctuations in hotel supply, occupancy and ADRs, decreases in airline capacity, periodically rising airline ticket prices and the imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, all of which Expedia has experienced historically.. Other factors that could negatively affect Expedia's business include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSignificant changes in oil prices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tContinued air carrier and hotel chain consolidation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tReduced access to discount airfares;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tTravel-related strikes or labor unrest, bankruptcies or liquidations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIncreased incidents of actual or threatened terrorism;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPeriods of political instability, geopolitical conflict or heightened local or regional crime activity, resulting in additional restrictions on travel or travelers becoming concerned about safety issues;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tNatural disasters or events such as severe weather conditions, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes or earthquakes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tTravel-related accidents or the grounding of aircraft due to safety concerns; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tHealth-related risks, such as the Ebola, H1N1, MERS CoV, SARs and avian flu outbreaks.. Such concerns could result in a protracted decrease in demand for Expedia's travel services. This decrease in demand, depending on its scope and duration, together with any future issues affecting travel safety, could significantly and adversely affect Expedia's business, working capital and financial performance over the short and long-term. In addition, the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events, such as severe weather conditions, actual or threatened terrorist activity or war, could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs and decrease Expedia's revenues leading to constrained liquidity if Expedia, as it has done historically in the case of severe weather conditions, provides relief to affected travelers by refunding the price or fees associated with airline tickets, hotel reservations and other travel products and services.. Expedia and Bodybuilding rely on the value of their brands, and the costs of maintaining and enhancing brand awareness are increasing.. Expedia and Bodybuilding invest considerable financial and human resources in their respective brands in order to retain and expand their customer bases in existing and emerging markets. We expect that the cost of maintaining and enhancing these brands will continue to increase due to a variety of factors, including increased spending from competitors, promotional and discounting activities, growing customer loyalty programs, supporting multiple brands and the impact of competition among these multiple brands, expanding marketing efforts in certain geographies and developing new products, inflation in media pricing including search engine keywords and the continued emergence and share growth of travel-related traffic share from search and metasearch engines. During 2017, certain online travel companies and metasearch websites continued to expand their offline and digital advertising campaigns globally, increasing competition for share of voice, and Expedia expects this activity to continue in the future. Expedia is also pursuing and expects to continue to pursue long-term growth opportunities, particularly in emerging markets, which have had and may continue to have a negative impact on its overall marketing efficiency. Bodybuilding's ability to maintain and enhance its brands will depend largely on its ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy and. I-23. Table of Contents. innovative products, which it may not be able to do successfully. Bodybuilding may also introduce new products, terms of service or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect its brand.. Expedia's and Bodybuilding's efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of their brands may not be successful, and, even if they are successful in their branding efforts, such efforts may not be cost-effective, or as efficient as they have been historically. Moreover, branding efforts with respect to some brands within the Expedia portfolio have in the past and may in the future result in marketing inefficiencies and negatively impact growth rates of other brands within its portfolio. In addition, decisions over allocation of resources, and choosing to invest in branding efforts for certain brands in Expedia's or Bodybuilding's respective portfolios at the expense of not investing in, or reducing their investments in, other brands in their respective portfolios could have an overall negative financial impact. If Expedia and Bodybuilding are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of their brands and generate demand in a cost-effective manner, it would have a material adverse effect on their businesses and financial performance.. Expedia and Bodybuilding rely on information technology to operate their businesses and maintain their competitiveness, and any failure to invest in and adapt to technological developments and industry trends could harm their businesses.. Expedia depends on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems, including technology and systems used for website and mobile applications, reservations, customer service, supplier connectivity, communications, procurement, payments, fraud detection and administration, while Bodybuilding relies extensively on information systems for its ecommerce business (which includes website, mobile applications, customer service, payment and fraud detection), supply chain, manufacturing operations, financial reporting, human resources and various other processes and transactions. As Expedia's and Bodybuilding's operations grow in size, scope and complexity, they must continuously improve and upgrade their systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of customers enhanced products, services, features and functionality, while maintaining or improving the reliability and integrity of their systems and infrastructure.. Expedia's and Bodybuilding's future success also depends on their ability to adapt their services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance, features and reliability of their services in response to competitive service and product offerings. Cloud computing, the continued growth of alternative platforms such as smartphone and tablet computing devices and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products, services or strategies that use cloud computing or for such platforms as well as other technological changes, including new devices, services and home assistants, such as Amazon's Echo and Alexa Voice and Google Home, and developing technologies, such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, chatbot and virtual reality technologies have, and will continue to, require new and costly investments in technology. Transitioning to these new technologies may be disruptive to resources and the services Expedia and Bodybuilding provide, and may increase their reliance on third party service providers.  For example, Expedia is in the midst of a multi-year project to migrate products, data storage and functionality and significantly increase its utilization of public cloud computing services (such as Amazon Web Services).  In addition, Expedia and Bodybuilding may not be successful, or may be less successful than their current or new competitors, in developing technology that operates effectively across multiple devices and platforms and that is appealing to consumers, either of which would negatively impact their businesses and financial performance. New developments in other areas, such as cloud computing and software as a service provider, could also make it easier for competition to enter Expedia's markets due to lower up-front technology costs. In addition, Expedia and Bodybuilding may not be able to maintain their existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as they would like or in a cost-effective manner.. Expedia has been engaged in a multi-year effort to migrate key portions of its consumer, affiliate, and corporate travel sites and back office application functionality to new technology platforms to enable it to improve conversion, innovate more rapidly, achieve better search engine optimization and improve its site merchandising and transaction processing capabilities, among other anticipated benefits. Bodybuilding also continually adds software and hardware, effectively upgrading its systems and network infrastructure, as well as taking other steps to improve the efficiency of its systems. Implementations and system enhancements such as these have been in the past, and may continue to be in the future, more time consuming and expensive than originally anticipated, and the resources devoted to those efforts have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, Expedia's and Bodybuilding's ability to develop new site features. In addition, during Expedia's migration process the sites have in the past, and may continue in the future, to experience reduced functionality, decreases in conversion rates, and increased costs relating to maintaining redundant systems. Also, Expedia and Bodybuilding may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems, or enhancements to existing infrastructure, technologies and systems, in the future. Overall, these implementations and systems enhancements may not achieve the desired results in a timely manner, to the extent anticipated, or at all. If any of these events occur, Expedia's and Bodybuilding's respective businesses and financial performance could suffer.. I-24. Table of Contents. Acquisitions, investments or significant commercial arrangements could result in operating and financial difficulties.. Expedia has acquired, invested in or entered into significant commercial arrangements with a number of businesses in the past, and its future growth may depend, in part, on future acquisitions, investments or significant commercial arrangements, any of which could be material to its financial condition and results of operations. Certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions, investments or significant commercial arrangements that may have a material impact on Expedia's business are:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDiversion of management's attention or other resources from Expedia's existing businesses; for example, during 2016, Expedia expended significant resources in the integration of Orbitz Worldwide, Inc.;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDifficulties and expenses in assimilating the operations, products, technology, privacy protection systems, information systems or personnel of the acquired company;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tUse of cash resources and incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities in funding and after consummating acquisitions, including with regard to future payment obligations in connection with put/call rights, may limit other potential uses of Expedia's cash, including stock repurchases, dividend payments and retirement of outstanding indebtedness;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAmortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets and other adverse accounting consequences, including changes in fair value of contingent consideration;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tExpected and unexpected costs incurred in pursuing acquisitions, including identifying and performing due diligence on potential acquisition targets that may or may not be successful, if unsuccessful could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes due, a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on Expedia's business, operating results or financial condition;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tImpairment of relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, vendors and affiliates of Expedia's business and the acquired business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe assumption of known and unknown debt and other liabilities and obligations of the acquired company;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFailure of the acquired company to achieve anticipated integration synergies traffic, transactions, revenues, earnings or cash flows or to retain key management or employees;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFailure to generate adequate returns on Expedia's acquisitions and investments, or returns in excess of alternative uses of capital;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFailure to properly and timely integrate acquired companies and their operations, reducing Expedia's ability to achieve, among other things, anticipated returns on its acquisitions through cost savings and other synergies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tEntrance into markets in which Expedia has no direct prior experience resulting in increased complexity in its business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChallenges relating to the structure of an investment, such as governance, accountability and decision-making conflicts, that may arise in the context of a joint venture or other majority ownership investments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tImpairment of goodwill or other intangible assets such as trademarks or other intellectual property arising from Expedia's acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCosts associated with litigation or other claims arising in connection with the acquired company;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIncreased or unexpected costs or delays to obtain governmental or regulatory approvals for acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIncreased competition amongst potential acquirers for acquisition targets could result in a material increase in the purchase price for such targets or otherwise limit Expedia's ability to consummate acquisitions; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAdverse market reaction to acquisitions or investments or failure to consummate such transactions.. Moreover, Expedia relies heavily on the representations and warranties and related indemnities provided to it by the sellers of acquired private companies, including as they relate to creation, ownership and rights in intellectual property and compliance with laws and contractual requirements. Expedia's failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions and investments could cause it to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities and harm its business generally.. I-25. Table of Contents. Expedia's HomeAway business is subject to regulatory risks and continues its transition to a primarily transaction-based business, either of which could have a material adverse effect on Expedia's operations and financial results.. HomeAway has been, and continues to be, subject to regulatory development that affects the vacation rental industry and the ability of companies like Expedia to list those vacation rentals online. For example, some states and local jurisdictions have adopted or are considering statutes or ordinances that prohibit property owners and managers from renting certain properties for fewer than 30 consecutive days or otherwise limit their ability to do so, and other states and local jurisdictions may introduce similar regulations. Many homeowners, condominium and neighborhood associations have adopted rules that prohibit or restrict short-term vacation rentals. In addition, many of the laws that impose taxes or other obligations on travel and lodging companies were established before the growth of the internet and the vacation rental industry, which creates a risk of those laws being interpreted in ways not originally intended that could burden property owners and managers or otherwise harm Expedia's business.. Expedia is subject to legal, financial and competitive risk associated with HomeAway's transition to a primarily transaction-based business. HomeAway historically generated the majority of its revenues when owners or managers of vacation rentals paid HomeAway subscription fees for the listing of their properties on the HomeAway family of websites. While subscription fees were previously the predominant source of revenue for HomeAway, a growing share of HomeAway's revenue is now generated from a commission-based business model, where the traveler pays a service fee for the use of the HomeAway platform and the owner or manager of the property pays HomeAway a fee or a commission on a transactional basis for each booking of the property by a traveler. HomeAway launched the traveler service fee and introduced its Book with Confidence Guarantee in the United States beginning in February 2016, followed by a rollout in Europe beginning in June 2016. In addition, HomeAway moved to a single subscription option for its homeowners and property manager partners in July 2016.  HomeAway's business model transition involves significant additional risks and potential costs for HomeAway, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDelays or unanticipated costs in completing the transition, which may delay or negate any expected benefits;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSuppliers and travelers may not adopt HomeAway's new marketplace or payment structures and may choose to transact with competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFailure to implement or expand HomeAway's technology, systems and network infrastructure in light of additional payment processing and reporting complexity, or failure to do so at a reasonable cost;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tNew efforts in search engine marketing and participation in metasearch may be ineffective and reduce HomeAway's ability to spend at the desired return on investment;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIncreased risk of fraud; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAdditional potential tax exposures.. These risks could have a material adverse effect on HomeAway's business and results of operations, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on Expedia's operations and financial results.. Expedia's and Bodybuilding's international operations involve additional risks and their exposure to these risks will increase as their businesses expand globally.. Expedia operates in a number of jurisdictions outside of the United States and intends to continue to expand its international presence. As Expedia has expanded globally, its international (non-U.S.) revenue has increased from 39% in 2010 to 45% in 2017. In foreign jurisdictions, Expedia faces complex, dynamic and varied risk landscapes. As Expedia begins to operate in new markets and countries, it must tailor its services, business models and functional compliance structures to the unique circumstances of such countries and markets, which can be complex, difficult, costly and divert management and personnel resources. Laws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses or Expedia's failure to adapt its practices, systems, processes and business models effectively to the traveler and supplier preferences (as well as the regulatory and tax landscapes) of each country into which it expands, could slow its growth. For example, to compete in certain international markets Expedia has in the past, and may in the future, adopt locally-preferred payment methods, which has increased its costs and instances of fraud. Certain international markets in which Expedia operates have lower margins than more mature markets, which could have a negative impact on its overall margins as its revenues from these markets grow over time.. I-26. Table of Contents. In addition to the risks outlined elsewhere in this section, Expedia's and Bodybuilding's international operations are also subject to a number of other risks, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCurrency exchange restrictions or costs and exchange rate fluctuations, and the risks and costs inherent in hedging such exposures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tExposure to local economic or political instability and threatened or actual acts of terrorism;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCompliance with U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory laws and requirements relating to anti-corruption, antitrust or competition, economic sanctions, data content and privacy, consumer protection, employment and labor laws, health and safety, information reporting and advertising and promotions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCompliance with additional U.S. laws applicable to U.S. companies operating internationally;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDifferences, inconsistent interpretations and changes in U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations, including tax laws enacted pursuant to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWeaker enforcement of Expedia's and Bodybuilding's contractual and intellectual property rights;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tLower levels of credit card usage and increased payment and fraud risk;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tLonger payment cycles, and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPreferences by local populations for local providers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRestrictions on, or adverse tax and other consequences related to the repatriation of cash, the withdrawal of non-U.S. investments, cash balances and earnings, as well as restrictions on the ability to invest in operations in certain countries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFinancial risk arising from transactions in multiple currencies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSlower adoption of the internet as an advertising, broadcast and commerce medium in those markets as compared to the United States;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tExpedia's and Bodybuilding's ability to support new technologies, including mobile devices or block chain technologies, that may be more prevalent in international markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDifficulties in attracting and retaining qualified employees in international markets, as well as managing staffing and operations due to increased complexity, unionization, distance, time zones, language and cultural differences; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tUncertainty regarding liability for products, services and content, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of precedent.. The China travel market in particular is significant and has grown significantly in recent years. Prior to May 2015, Expedia conducted its operations in China primarily through its majority ownership interest in eLong, Inc., online travel service provider in China. Following the sale of its eLong ownership stake in May 2015 to a group of China-based purchasers, including to a subsidiary of Ctrip International, Ltd., Expedia has conducted its business in China through localized websites and commercial arrangements with local partners, including Ctrip. There can be no guarantee that Expedia will be able to grow or even maintain market share and brand awareness in the highly dynamic and intensely competitive market in China and its failure to do so could significantly impact its ability to grow its overall business.. A failure to comply with current laws, rules and regulations or changes to such laws, rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties may adversely affect Expedia's and Bodybuilding's businesses, financial performance, results of operations or business growth.. Expedia's and Bodybuilding's businesses and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing laws, rules and regulations or the promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations applicable to Expedia and Bodybuilding and their businesses, including those relating to travel and vacation rental licensing and listing requirements, the sale and advertising of substances regulated by the FDA and other government agencies, the internet and online commerce, internet advertising and price display, consumer protection, anti-corruption, anti-trust and competition, economic and trade sanctions, tax, banking, data security, the provision of payment services and privacy. As a result, regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend Expedia or Bodybuilding from carrying on some or all of their activities or otherwise penalize. I-27. Table of Contents. Expedia or Bodybuilding if its practices were found not to comply with applicable regulatory or licensing requirements or any binding interpretation of such requirements. Unfavorable changes or interpretations could decrease demand for Expedia's and Bodybuilding's products and services, limit marketing methods and capabilities, affect their margins, increase costs and/or subject them to additional liabilities.. For example, there are, and will likely continue to be, an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce that may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet, display of certain taxes and fees, online editorial and user-generated content, user privacy, behavioral targeting and online advertising, taxation, liability for third-party activities and the quality of products and services. Furthermore, the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws and more aggressive enforcement efforts, which may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally.. Likewise, the SEC, Department of Justice and Office of Foreign Assets Controls (\"OFAC\"), as well as foreign regulatory authorities, have continued to increase the enforcement of economic sanctions and trade regulations and anti-corruption laws across industries. U.S. economic sanctions relate to transactions with designated foreign countries, including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria and the Crimea region of the Ukraine, and nationals and others of those countries, as well as certain specifically targeted individuals and entities. Expedia and Bodybuilding believe that their respective activities comply with OFAC, European Union, United Kingdom and other regulatory authorities' economic sanction and trade regulations and anti-corruption regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and the UK Criminal Finances Act. As regulations continue to evolve and regulatory oversight continues to increase, Expedia and Bodybuilding cannot guarantee that their respective programs and policies will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. In the event their controls should fail or are found to be out of compliance for other reasons, they could be subject to monetary damages, civil and criminal money penalties, litigation and damage to their reputation and the value of their brands.. Expedia also has been subject, and it will likely be subject in the future, to inquiries or legal proceedings from time to time from regulatory bodies concerning compliance with consumer protection, competition, tax and travel industry-specific laws and regulations, including but not limited to investigations and legal proceedings relating to the travel industry and, in particular, parity provisions in contracts between hotels and online travel companies, including Expedia and the presentation of information to consumers. The failure of Expedia's businesses to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines and/or proceedings against it by governmental agencies and/or consumers, which if material, could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, if such laws and regulations are not enforced equally against other competitors in a particular market, Expedia's compliance with such laws may put it at a competitive disadvantage vis--vis competitors who do not comply with such requirements. Expedia is unable at this time to predict the timing or outcome of these various investigations and lawsuits or similar future investigations or lawsuits, and their impact, if any, on its business and results of operations.. The promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations, or the new interpretation of existing laws, rules and regulations, in each case that restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which Expedia provides travel services could require it to change certain aspects of its business, operations and commercial relationships to ensure compliance, which could decrease demand for services, reduce revenues, increase costs and/or subject the company to additional liabilities.. From time to time, Congress, the FDA, the FTC or other federal, state, local or foreign legislative and regulatory authorities may impose additional laws or regulations that apply to Bodybuilding, repeal laws or regulations that Bodybuilding considers favorable to it or impose more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations. Such developments could require formulation of certain products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of certain products, additional or different labeling and advertising, additional scientific substantiation, adverse event reporting or other new requirements.. Furthermore, Expedia's and Bodybuilding's future growth may be limited by anti-trust or competition laws. For example, Expedia's business has grown and continues to expand, and, as a consequence, increases in its size and market share may negatively affect its ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisitions, investments or significant commercial arrangements, any of which could adversely affect Expedia's ability to grow and compete.. I-28. Table of Contents. Application of existing tax laws, rules or regulations are subject to interpretation by taxing authorities.. The application of various domestic and international income and non-income tax laws, rules and regulations to Expedia's historical and new products and services is subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing authorities. These taxing authorities have become more aggressive in their interpretation and/or enforcement of such laws, rules and regulations over time, as governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase revenues. This has contributed to an increase in audit activity and harsher stances by tax authorities. As such, additional taxes or other assessments may be in excess of Expedia's current tax reserves or may require Expedia to modify its business practices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.. A number of taxing authorities have made inquiries, filed lawsuits and/or levied assessments asserting that Expedia is required to collect and remit hotel occupancy, state and local sales or use taxes or other taxes. Expedia is also in various stages of inquiry or audit with multiple jurisdictions regarding the application of value added/goods and services tax to its transactions. While Expedia believes it complies with applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it facilitates travel reservations, tax authorities may conclude that it owes additional taxes and issue tax assessments. Expedia has in the past been required, and may in the future be required in certain domestic and foreign jurisdictions to pay any such tax assessments prior to contesting their validity, which payments may be substantial. This requirement is commonly referred to as \"pay-to-play.\" Payment of these amounts is not an admission that the taxpayer believes it is subject to such taxes. For example, as a pre-condition to challenging the assessments, during 2009, Expedia paid $48 million under protest to the city of San Francisco and an additional $25.5 million under protest on May 26, 2014 in connection with additional assessments; and during 2013, Expedia paid $171 million to the state of Hawaii. In September 2015, following a ruling by the Hawaii Supreme Court the State of Hawaii refunded the Expedia companies $132 million of the original \"pay-to-play\" amount, and Orbitz also received a similar refund of $22 million. On May 15, 2017, the Expedia companies paid under protest the full amount claimed due, or approximately $16.7 million, as a condition of appealing the August 5, 2016 decision by the Hawaii tax court holding that taxes are due on the online travel companies' services to facilitate merchant model car rental transactions.. Significant judgment and estimation is required in determining Expedia's worldwide tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of Expedia's business, there are transactions and calculations, including intercompany transactions and cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing, for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation. Tax authorities may disagree with Expedia's intercompany charges, including the amount of or basis for such charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes. For example, the IRS recently notified Expedia of a proposed adjustment relating to transfer pricing with Expedia's foreign subsidiaries in connection with the examination of the 2009-2010 tax years, and although Expedia disagrees with the IRS' position and are challenging the adjustments, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to Expedia, may adversely affect its financial results. Expedia believes its tax estimates are reasonable, however, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from its historical tax provisions and accruals in which case it may be subject to additional tax liabilities, possibly including interest and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on its cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.. The enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities, the adoption of other corporate tax reform policies, or changes in tax legislation or policies could materially affect the financial position and results of operations of Expedia and Bodybuilding.. While many of the underlying laws, rules or regulations imposing taxes and other obligations were established before the growth of the digital economy, some jurisdictions have enacted new tax laws, rules and regulations directed at the digital economy and multi-national businesses. If existing tax laws, rules or regulations are amended, or if new unfavorable tax laws, rules or regulations are enacted, particularly with respect to occupancy, sales, value-added taxes, or unclaimed property, or other tax laws applicable to the digital economy or multi-national businesses, the results could increase Expedia's or Bodybuilding's respective tax payments, including the possibility of double taxation, or other obligations, prospectively or retrospectively, subject Expedia or Bodybuilding to interest and penalties, decrease the demand for their products and services if they pass on such costs to the consumer, result in increased costs to update or expand their technical or administrative infrastructure or effectively limit the scope of their business activities if they decided not to conduct business in particular jurisdictions. As a result, these changes could have an adverse effect on Expedia's and Bodybuilding's businesses or financial performance.. Taxing authorities may also successfully assert that Bodybuilding should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, commercial activity, value-added taxes (\"VAT\") or similar taxes, and it could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales. Bodybuilding does not collect sales and use, commercial activity, VAT or similar taxes in all jurisdictions in. I-29. Table of Contents. which it has sales, based on its belief that such taxes are not applicable. Several states have presented Bodybuilding with tax assessments, alleging that it is required to collect and remit sales and other similar taxes. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest or future requirements could have an adverse effect on Bodybuilding's business or financial performance.. Corporate tax reform, base-erosion efforts and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many tax jurisdictions where Expedia has business operations. As a result, policies regarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation is being proposed or enacted in several jurisdictions. For example, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reforms U.S. corporate income taxes and, among other things, reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, but imposes base-erosion prevention measures as well as a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings. Expedia's initial estimates of the financial impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may change as it reviews its analysis and as additional guidance becomes available. In general, changes in tax laws may affect Expedia's tax rate, increase its tax liabilities, carrying value of deferred tax assets, or its deferred tax liabilities.. In addition, in October 2015, the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development  released a final package of suggested measures to be implemented by member nations in response to a 2013 action plan calling for a coordinated multi-jurisdictional approach to \"base erosion and profit shifting\" by multinational companies. Multiple member jurisdictions, including countries in which we operate, have begun implementing recommended changes such as country by country reporting (\"CBCR\"). The CBCR standards require multinationals to disclose certain financial and economic indicators across geographies. The CBCR disclosure is expected to result in increased global tax audit activity. Additional legislative changes are anticipated in upcoming years. Certain countries have adopted unilateral changes increasing the risk of double taxation. Any changes to U.S. or international tax laws or interpretation of current or existing law could impact the tax treatment of Expedia's and Bodybuilding's earnings and adversely affect their profitability. Expedia's and Bodybuilding's tax liabilities in the future could also be adversely affected by changes to their operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or the discontinuance of beneficial tax arrangements in certain jurisdictions.. Expedia and Bodybuilding continue to work with, as appropriate, relevant governmental authorities and legislators to clarify their obligations under existing, new and emerging tax laws, rules and regulations. However, due to the large scale of its international business activities any substantial changes in international corporate tax policies, enforcement activities or legislative initiatives may materially and adversely affect Expedia's business, the amount of taxes it is required to pay and its financial condition and results of operations generally.. Expedia and Bodybuilding are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes, which could adversely affect their businesses and financial condition.. Expedia is involved in various legal proceedings and claims involving taxes, property, personal injury, contract, alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, antitrust, consumer protection, securities laws, and other claims. Bodybuilding may be subject to intellectual property litigation and infringement claims initiated by others, other competitors or entities may assert rights in, or ownership of, its trademarks and other intellectual property rights or in marks that are similar to Bodybuilding's, and it may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to its satisfaction. These matters may involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief that might necessitate changes to Expedia's or Bodybuilding's businesses or operations. The defense of these actions is and will likely continue to be both time consuming and expensive and their outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty. Determining reserves for pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant legal judgment. It is possible that unfavorable outcomes in one or more such proceedings could result in substantial payments that could adversely affect Expedia's or Bodybuilding's businesses, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period. System interruptions, security breaches and the lack of redundancy in Expedia's and Bodybuilding's respective information systems may harm their businesses.. Expedia and Bodybuilding rely on information technology systems, including the Internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities and to transmit and store data, including booking and purchase transactions, intellectual property, proprietary business information and that of its suppliers and business partners, personally identifiable information of its customers and employees, and data with respect to invoicing information and the collection of payments, accounting, procurement, and supply chain activities. In addition, Expedia relies on its information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. Bodybuilding relies extensively on information systems for its ecommerce business, supply chain, manufacturing operations, financial reporting, human resources and various other processes and transactions.. I-30. Table of Contents. The risk of a cybersecurity-related attack, intrusion, or disruption, including through spyware, viruses, phishing, denial of service and similar attacks by criminal organizations, hacktivists, foreign governments, and terrorists, is persistent. Additionally, as Expedia continues to integrate legacy systems from its acquired companies, such as Orbitz and HomeAway, into its information technology systems, it may increase the risk of these system interruptions. Expedia and Bodybuilding have experienced and may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent them from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties. These interruptions could include security intrusions, attacks on systems for fraud or service interruption, computer and telecommunications failures and natural events. Significant interruptions, outages or delays in their internal systems, or systems of third parties that they rely upon  -  including multiple co-location providers for data centers, cloud computing providers for application hosting, and network access providers  -  and network access, or deterioration in the performance of such systems, would impair their ability to process transactions, decrease the quality of service that they can offer to customers, damage their reputation and brands, increase their costs and/or cause losses.. Potential security breaches to Expedia's or Bodybuilding's systems or the systems of their service providers, whether resulting from internal or external sources, could significantly harm their respective businesses. Both Expedia and Bodybuilding devote significant resources to network security, monitoring and testing, employee training and other security measures, but there can be no guarantee that these measures will prevent all possible security breaches or attacks. A party, whether internal or external, that is able to circumvent Expedia's or Bodybuilding's security systems could misappropriate customer or employee information, intellectual property, proprietary information or other business and financial data or cause significant interruptions in their operations. Expedia and Bodybuilding may need to expend additional significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches, and a security breach resulting in the reductions in website availability could cause a loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such incident. Because the techniques used to sabotage security change frequently, are often not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated or remote areas around the world, Expedia and Bodybuilding may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Security breaches could result in negative publicity, damage to reputation, exposure to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability due to regulatory penalties and sanctions or pursuant to contractual arrangements with payment card processors for associated expenses and penalties. Security breaches could also cause customers and potential users of Expedia and Bodybuilding and their respective business partners to lose confidence in their security, which would have a negative effect on the value of their brands. Failure to quickly respond to or failure to adequately protect against attacks or intrusions, whether for Expedia's or Bodybuilding's own systems or systems of vendors, could expose them to security breaches that could have an adverse impact on financial performance.. In addition, no assurance can be given that Expedia's or Bodybuilding's backup systems or contingency plans will sustain critical aspects of their operations or business processes in all circumstances, many other systems are not fully redundant and their disaster recovery or business continuity planning may not be sufficient. Fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, electronic intrusion attempts from both external and internal sources and similar events or disruptions may damage or impact or interrupt computer or communications systems or business processes at any time. Although Expedia and Bodybuilding have put measures in place to protect certain portions of their respective facilities and assets, any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent Expedia or Bodybuilding from providing services to their customers and/or third parties for a significant period of time. In addition, remediation efforts may be costly for which Expedia and Bodybuilding may not have adequate insurance to cover such losses or costs. Moreover, the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain.. Expedia and Bodybuilding process, store and use customer and employee personal information, financial (including payment card information) and other consumer data, which subjects them to risks stemming from possible failure to comply with governmental regulation and other legal obligations, as well as litigation and reputational risks associated with the failure to protect such data from unauthorized use, theft or destruction.. Expedia and Bodybuilding may acquire personal, financial or confidential information from users of their websites and mobile applications and from their respective administration functions. There are numerous laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of customer and employee personal information, financial (including payment card information) and other consumer data, the scope of which is changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules. Expedia and Bodybuilding strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection. It is possible, however, that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or the practices of the companies.. I-31. Table of Contents. Any failure or perceived failure by Expedia and Bodybuilding, or their respective service providers, to comply with the privacy policies, privacy-related obligations to users or other third parties, or privacy related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized use, theft or destruction of such data, may result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to the respective reputations and brands of Expedia and Bodybuilding, their ability to retain customers or attract new customers and the potential disruption to their respective business and plans.  In addition, such an event could result in violations of applicable U.S. and international laws, governmental enforcement actions and consumer or securities litigation. Such events could also subject Expedia and Bodybuilding to bank fines, penalties or increased transaction costs, damage their respective reputations and brands, impair their relationships with current and potential business partners and key service providers, all of which could have an adverse effect on the business of each of Expedia and Bodybuilding.. Expedia and Bodybuilding are subject to international privacy regulations, compliance with these regulations could impose significant compliance burdens.. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny. The U.S. Congress and federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, are reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection and use of information concerning consumer behavior on the internet, including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices. U.S. courts are also considering the applicability of existing federal and state statutes, including computer trespass and wiretapping laws, to the collection and exchange of information online.. In addition, the European Union adopted the GDPR, which mandates that companies meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. The GDPR may result in a greater compliance burden for companies, including Expedia and Bodybuilding, with users in Europe and increased compliance costs. Failure to meet these requirements could result in significant penalties. Further, although the European Union and the U.S. have fully implemented a new data transfer framework, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, it is the subject of litigation.  Finally, proposed new regulations regarding privacy and electronic communications are under consideration in the European Union.. Expedia and Bodybuilding are subject to payments-related and fraud risks.. Expedia has agreements with companies that process customer credit and debit card transactions, the volume of which are very large and continue to grow, for the facilitation of customer bookings of travel services from Expedia's travel suppliers. These agreements allow these processing companies, under certain conditions, to hold an amount of Expedia's cash (a \"holdback\") or require Expedia to otherwise post security equal to a portion of bookings that have been processed by that company. These processing companies may be entitled to a holdback or suspension of processing services upon the occurrence of specified events, including material adverse changes in Expedia's financial condition. An imposition of a holdback or suspension of processing services by one or more of Expedia's processing companies could materially reduce Expedia's liquidity. Moreover, there can be no assurances that the interchange rates or fees Expedia and Bodybuilding pay for the processing of customer credit and debit card transactions will not increase which could reduce Expedia's and Bodybuilding's revenue, thereby adversely affecting their businesses and financial performance.. In addition, credit card networks, such as Visa, MasterCard and American Express, have adopted rules and regulations that apply to all merchants who process and accept credit cards and include payment card association operating rules, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (\"PCI DSS\"). Under these rules, Expedia and Bodybuilding are required to adopt and implement internal controls over the use, storage and security of card data. Expedia and Bodybuilding assess their compliance with the PCI DSS rules on a periodic basis and make necessary improvements to their internal controls. If Expedia and Bodybuilding fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if their respective data security systems are breached or compromised, they may be liable for card issuing banks' costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose their ability to accept credit and debit card payments from their customers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and their respective businesses and operating results could be adversely affected.. Expedia's and Bodybuilding's results of operations and financial positions have been negatively affected by their acceptance of fraudulent orders made using credit and debit cards or fraudulently obtained loyalty points. Expedia and Bodybuilding are sometimes held liable for accepting fraudulent orders on their websites or other orders for which payment is subsequently disputed by their customers, both of which lead to the reversal of payments received by Expedia or Bodybuilding,. I-32. Table of Contents. as applicable, for such orders (a \"charge back\"). Accordingly, Expedia and Bodybuilding calculate and record allowances for the resulting credit and debit card charge backs. Expedia's and Bodybuilding's abilities to detect and combat fraudulent schemes, which have become increasingly common and sophisticated, may be negatively impacted by the adoption of new payment methods, the emergence and innovation of new technology platforms, including smartphones, tablet computers and in-home assistants, and global expansion, including into markets with a history of elevated fraudulent activity. In addition, for existing and future payment options Expedia and Bodybuilding offers to its respective customers, they may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of their payments products), as well as fraud. If Expedia and Bodybuilding are unable to effectively combat fraudulent orders on their websites or mobile applications or if they otherwise experience increased levels of charge backs, Expedia's and Bodybuilding's respective results of operations and financial positions could be materially adversely affected.. In addition, when onboarding suppliers to Expedia's websites, Expedia may fail to identify falsified or stolen supplier credentials, which may result in fraudulent bookings or unauthorized access to personal or confidential information of users of its websites and mobile applications. A fraudulent supplier scheme could also result in negative publicity, damage to Expedia's reputation, and could cause users of its websites and mobile applications to lose confidence in the quality of its services. Any of these events would have a negative effect on the value of Expedia's brands, which could have an adverse impact on its financial performance.. Expedia has foreign exchange risk.. Expedia conducts a significant and growing portion of its business outside the United States. As a result, it faces exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, particularly those related to the British pound sterling, Euro, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Thai baht, Brazilian real, and Nordic currencies.. These exposures include but are not limited to re-measurement gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities; translation gains and losses on foreign subsidiary financial results that are translated into U.S. dollars upon consolidation; fluctuations in hotel revenue due to relative currency movements from the time of booking to the time of stay; planning risk related to changes in exchange rates between the time Expedia prepares its annual and quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur; and the impact of relative exchange rate movements on cross-border travel such as from Europe to the United States and the United States to Europe.. Depending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates, if Expedia chooses not to hedge or fails to hedge effectively its exposure, it could experience a material adverse effect on its financial statements and financial condition. As seen in some recent periods, in the event of severe volatility in exchange rates these exposures can increase, and the impact on Expedia's results of operations can be more pronounced. In addition, the current environment and the increasingly global nature of Expedia's business have made hedging these exposures more complex. Expedia has increased and plans to continue increasing the scope and complexity of its foreign exchange risk management. Expedia makes a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases cancellations and payments in foreign currencies. In addition, an effective exchange rate hedging program is dependent upon effective systems, accurate and reliable data sources, controls and change management procedures. In the event Expedia's estimates differ significantly from actual results or if it fails to adopt effective hedging processes, Expedia could experience greater volatility as a result of its hedging activities.. Expedia's stock price is highly volatile.. The market price of Expedia's common stock is highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond its control:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tQuarterly variations in its operating and financial results;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOperating and financial results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors, including failure to deliver returns on technology or emerging market marketing investments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in expectations as to Expedia's future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRating agency credit rating actions or pronouncements;. I-33. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tReaction to Expedia's earnings releases and conference calls, or presentations by executives at investor and industry conferences;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWorldwide macro-economic conditions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in Expedia's capital or governance structure;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in the stock price or market valuations of trivago, Expedia's majority-owned, publicly traded subsidiary, whose stock price is also highly volatile;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in market valuations of other internet or online service companies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in device and platform technologies and search industry dynamics, such as key word pricing and traffic, or other changes that negatively affect Expedia's ability to generate traffic to its websites;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAnnouncements of dividends or changes in the amount or frequency of Expedia's dividends;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAnnouncements by Expedia or its competitors of technological innovations, new services or promotional and discounting activities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAnnouncements by Expedia or its competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tLoss of a major travel supplier, such as an airline, hotel or car rental chain;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in the status of Expedia's intellectual property rights;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tLack of success in the expansion of Expedia's business model geographically;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tClaims or proceedings against Expedia or adverse developments or decisions in pending proceedings;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSignificant security breaches;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAdditions or departures of key personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRumors or public speculation about any of the above factors; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPrice and volume fluctuations in the stock markets in general.. Volatility in Expedia's stock price could also make it less attractive to certain investors, and/or invite speculative trading in its common stock or debt instruments.. Expedia may experience constraints in its liquidity and may be unable to access capital when necessary or desirable, either of which could harm its financial position.. Expedia has experienced, and may experience in the future, declines in seasonal liquidity and capital provided by its merchant hotel business, which has historically provided a meaningful portion of its operating cash flow and is dependent on several factors, including the rate of growth of Expedia's merchant hotel business and the relative growth of businesses which consume rather than generate working capital, such as its agency hotel, advertising and managed corporate travel businesses and payment terms with suppliers. Expedia also continued to see growth in both its merchant (Expedia Collect) and agency (Hotel Collect) hotel products. To the extent its merchant hotel business stopped growing or began to decline, it would likely result in pressure on Expedia's working capital cash balances, cash flow over time and liquidity.. The availability of funds depends in significant measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which Expedia exerts no control. In light of periodic uncertainty in the capital and credit markets, Expedia can provide no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable or even any terms to fund investments, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends, debt refinancing or extraordinary actions or that its counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments. In addition, any downgrade of Expedia's debt ratings by Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investor Service, Fitch or similar ratings agencies, increases in general interest rate levels and credit spreads or overall weakening in the credit markets could increase its cost of capital.. I-34. Table of Contents. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny. The U.S. Congress and federal agencies, including the FTC and the Department of Commerce, are reviewing the need for greater regulation of the collection and use of information concerning consumer behavior on the internet, including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices. U.S. courts are also considering the applicability of existing federal and state statutes, including computer trespass and wiretapping laws, to the collection and exchange of information online. In addition, the new data transfer network between the EU and U.S. and the EU - U.S. Privacy Shield, may result in a greater compliance burden for companies, including Expedia, with users in Europe and increased costs of compliance. The European Union has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, effective in May 2018, which establishes new data laws that give customers additional rights and impose additional restrictions and penalties on companies for illegal collection and misuse of personal information.  Further on January 10, 2017, the European Commission proposed new regulations regarding privacy and electronic communications, including additional regulation of the Internet tracking tools known as \"cookies.\" Finally, countries in other regions, most notably Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America, are increasingly implementing new privacy regulations, resulting in additional compliance burdens and uncertainty as to how some of these laws will be interpreted.. Expedia relies on the performance of highly skilled personnel and, if it is unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel, its business would be harmed.. Expedia's performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Expedia's future success depends on its continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of its organization. In particular, the contributions of Mr. Diller, Expedia's Chairman and Senior Executive, and Mark Okerstrom, its Chief Executive Officer, are critical to the overall management of the company. Expedia's future success will depend on the performance of its senior management and key employees. Expedia cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of Mr. Diller, Mr. Okerstrom or any other member of its senior management or key employees, the loss of whom could seriously harm its business. Expedia does not maintain any key person life insurance policies. Competition for well-qualified employees in certain aspects of Expedia's business, including software engineers, developers, product management personnel, development personnel, and other technology professionals, also remains intense.. Expedia's continued ability to compete effectively depends on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate its existing employees. For example, additional barriers to or restrictions on travel for professional or personal purposes, such as those in the United States in early 2017, may cause significant disruption to Expedia's businesses or negatively affect its ability to attract and retain employees on a global basis. If Expedia does not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees, its business would be adversely affected.. Expedia has in the past, and may again in the future, restructure portions of its global workforce to simplify and streamline its organization, improve its cost structure and strengthen its overall businesses. These changes could affect employee morale and productivity and be disruptive to Expedia's business and financial performance.. Actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between Expedia management and directors, on the one hand, and the management and directors of IAC/InterActiveCorp, on the other.. Mr. Diller serves as Expedia's Chairman of the Board of Directors and Senior Executive, while retaining his role as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Senior Executive of IAC/InterActiveCorp (\"IAC\"), and Mr. Victor Kaufman serves as Vice Chairman of both Expedia and IAC. The fact that Mr. Diller and Mr. Kaufman hold positions with and securities of both companies could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest for them when facing decisions that may affect both IAC and Expedia. They may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of their time between the companies.. Expedia's certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of Expedia who is also an officer or director of IAC will be liable to Expedia or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to IAC instead of Expedia, or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to Expedia because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to IAC. This corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between the companies because the provision effectively shields an overlapping director/executive officer from liability for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to IAC instead of Expedia.. I-35. Table of Contents. Expedia and Bodybuilding work closely with various business partners and rely on third-parties for many systems and services, and therefore could be harmed by their activities.. Expedia and Bodybuilding could be harmed by the activities of third parties that they do not control. Expedia and Bodybuilding work closely with business partners, including in connection with significant commercial arrangements and joint ventures, and, in the case of Expedia, through its Expedia Affiliate Network business. Expedia and Bodybuilding also rely on third-party service providers for certain customer care, fulfillment, processing, systems development, technology and other services, including, increasingly, travel care (in the case of Expedia) and information technology services. If these partners or third-party service providers experience difficulty or fail to meet Expedia's or Bodybuilding's respective requirements or standards of applicable laws or the requirements or standards of governmental authorities, it could damage Expedia's and Bodybuilding's respective reputations, make it difficult for them to operate some aspects of their respective businesses, or expose Expedia and Bodybuilding to liability for their actions which could have an adverse impact on Expedia's and Bodybuilding's respective businesses and financial performance. Likewise, if the third-party service providers on which Expedia and Bodybuilding rely were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, face financial distress or other business disruption, Expedia and Bodybuilding could suffer increased costs and delays in their ability to provide similar services until an equivalent service provider could be found or Expedia and Bodybuilding could develop replacement technology or operations, any of which could also have an adverse impact on Expedia's and Bodybuilding's respective business and financial performance.. Expedia is exposed to various counterparty risks.. Expedia is exposed to the risk that various counterparties, including financial entities, will fail to perform. This creates risk in a number of areas, including with respect to Expedia's bank deposits and investments, foreign exchange risk management, insurance coverages, and letters of credit. As it relates to deposits, as of December 31, 2017, Expedia held cash in bank depository accounts of approximately $2.1 billion (primarily in Bank of America, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, BNP Paribas, HSBC and JPMorgan Chase) and held time deposits of approximately $852 million at financial institutions including BNP Paribas, JPMorgan Chase, Mizuho Bank Ltd. (\"Mizuho\"), The Bank of Nova Scotia, Sumitomo Mitsui Bank, National Australia Bank, and Standard Chartered Bank. Additionally, majority-owned subsidiaries of Expedia held cash of approximately $163 million (primarily in Deutsche Bank, HSBC and National Australia Bank and held term deposits of approximately $169 million at financial institutions including CitiBank and Deutsche Bank). As it relates to foreign exchange, as of December 31, 2017, Expedia was party to forward contracts with a notional value of approximately $2.6 billion, the fair value of which was an asset of approximately $6 million. The counterparties to these contracts were Barclays Bank, BNP Paribas, Bank of America, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Citibank, Credit Suisse International, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Mizuho, Royal Bank of Canada, Standard Chartered Bank, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Societe Generale, US Bank and Wells Fargo. Expedia employs forward contracts to hedge a portion of its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. At the end of the deposit term or upon the maturity of the forward contracts, the counterparties are obligated, or potentially obligated in the case of forward contracts, to return Expedia's funds or pay Expedia net settlement values. If any of these counterparties were to liquidate, declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease operations, it may not be able to satisfy its obligations under these time deposits or forward contracts.. In addition, due to instability in the economy Expedia also faces increased credit risk and payment delays from its non-financial contract counterparties.. Expedia has significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business and financial condition.. Expedia has outstanding long-term indebtedness, excluding current maturities, with a face value of $3.7 billion, and it has a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. Risks relating to Expedia's indebtedness include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreasing Expedia's vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequiring Expedia to dedicate a portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmaking it difficult for Expedia to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for its businesses;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimiting Expedia's flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its businesses and the markets in which it operates;. I-36. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tplacing Expedia at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimiting Expedia's ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow funds at rates or on other terms that Expedia finds acceptable.. The agreements governing Expedia's indebtedness contain various covenants that may limit its ability to effectively operate its businesses, including those that restrict its ability to, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tborrow money, and guarantee or provide other support for indebtedness of third parties including guarantees;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpay dividends on, redeem or repurchase Expedia's capital stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into certain asset sale transactions, including partial or full spin-off transactions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into secured financing arrangements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into sale and leaseback transactions; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into unrelated businesses.. In addition, Expedia's credit facility requires that it meet certain financial tests, including an interest coverage test and a leverage ratio test.. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of Expedia's credit facility or any agreement governing its other indebtedness may result in an event of default under those agreements. Such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt, which acceleration may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt. In addition, lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply Expedia with further funds (including periodic rollovers of existing borrowings). In addition, it is possible that Expedia may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business. The terms of Expedia's credit facility and the indentures governing its outstanding senior notes allow it to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations. If new debt is added to current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify.. Expedia and Bodybuilding cannot be sure that their intellectual property and proprietary information is protected from copying or use by others, including potential competitors.. Expedia's and Bodybuilding's websites and mobile applications rely on content, brands, domain names and technology, much of which is proprietary. Expedia and Bodybuilding establish and protect their intellectual property by relying on a combination of trademark, domain name, copyright, trade secret and patent laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, license and confidentiality agreements, and internal policies and procedures. In connection with Expedia's and Bodybuilding's license agreements with third parties, they seek to control access to, and the use and distribution of, their proprietary information and intellectual property. Even with these precautions, however, it may be possible for another party to copy or otherwise obtain and use Expedia's or Bodybuilding's intellectual property without their authorization or to develop similar intellectual property independently. Effective trademark, domain name, copyright, patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every jurisdiction in which Expedia's and Bodybuilding's services are made available, and policing unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and expensive. Expedia and Bodybuilding cannot be sure that the steps they have taken will prevent misappropriation or infringement of their respective intellectual property. Any misappropriation or violation of these rights could have a material adverse effect on Expedia's and Bodybuilding's respective businesses. Furthermore, Expedia or Bodybuilding may need to go to court or other tribunals to enforce their intellectual property rights, to protect their trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. These proceedings might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.. Expedia currently licenses from third parties some of the technologies, content and brands incorporated into its websites. As it continues to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies, content and brands, Expedia may be required to license additional technology, content or brands. Expedia cannot be sure that such technology, content and brand licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.. I-37. Table of Contents. Bodybuilding operates in a highly competitive industry and its failure to compete effectively could materially and adversely affect its sales and growth prospects.. Bodybuilding competes primarily against other online, retailers specialty retailers, supermarkets, drugstores, mass merchants, multi-level marketing organizations and mail order companies. This market is sensitive to the introduction of new products, which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market. As certain products become more mainstream, Bodybuilding experiences increased competition for those products. For example, as the trend in favor of whey protein products developed, it experienced increased competition for whey protein products from supermarkets, drug stores, mass merchants and other food companies. Increased competition from companies that distribute through retail, e-commerce or wholesale channels could have a material adverse effect on Bodybuilding's financial condition and results of operations. Certain of Bodybuilding's competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources. In addition, Bodybuilding's competitors may be more effective and efficient in introducing new products. Bodybuilding may not be able to compete effectively, and any of the factors listed above may cause price reductions, reduced margins and losses of market share.. Bodybuilding's failure to appropriately and timely respond to changing consumer preferences and demand for new products and services could significantly harm its customer relationships and its business, financial condition and results of operations.. Bodybuilding's performance is affected by industry trends including, among others, demographic trends and health and lifestyle preferences, as well as other factors, such as industry media coverage and governmental actions. For example, this industry is subject to potential regulatory activity and other legal matters that could affect the credibility of a given product or category of products. Consumer trends and their overall impact on consumer spending and limited product innovation and introductions in the VMS industry can dramatically affect purchasing patterns. Additionally, Bodybuilding's performance is affected by competitive trends such as the entry of new competitors, changes in promotional strategies or expansion of product assortment by various competitors.. Sales of sports nutrition products are generally more sensitive to consumer trends, such as increased demand for products recommended by the media, resulting in higher volatility than other products. Accordingly, Bodybuilding sells what it believes are appropriate sports nutrition products in response to prevailing market conditions and consumer demands.. Bodybuilding relies on consumer perception regarding the safety, quality and effectiveness of the supplement products it sells, as well as similar products distributed by other companies. Consumer perception of products can be significantly influenced by adverse publicity in the form of published scientific research, national media attention or other publicity, whether or not accurate, that associates consumption of Bodybuilding's products or any other similar products with illness or other adverse effects, or questions the benefits of Bodybuilding's products or other similar products or that claims that any such products are ineffective. Future scientific research or publicity could be unfavorable to the industry or any of Bodybuilding's specific products and may not be consistent with earlier favorable research or publicity. Unfavorable research or publicity could have a material adverse effect on Bodybuilding's ability to generate sales.. Bodybuilding's business is subject to changing consumer trends and preferences. Any failure to accurately predict or react to these trends could negatively impact consumer opinion of Bodybuilding as a source for high demand or the latest products, which in turn could harm its customer relationships and cause it to lose market share. The success of Bodybuilding's product offerings depends upon a number of factors, including its ability to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tanticipate customer needs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuccessfully introduce new products in a timely manner;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprice its products competitively;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdeliver its products in sufficient volumes and in a timely manner; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifferentiate its product offerings from those of its competitors.. I-38. Table of Contents. Bodybuilding may be subject to material product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products it sells, which could increase its costs and adversely affect its reputation, revenues and operating income.. Some of the products Bodybuilding sells, distributes or manufactures may expose it to product liability claims relating to personal injury, death, or environmental or property damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. Bodybuilding's products consist of vitamins, minerals, herbs and other ingredients that are classified as foods or dietary supplements and are not subject to pre-market regulatory approval in the United States. These products could contain contaminated substances, and some of the products contain ingredients that do not have long histories of human consumption. Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of these ingredients could occur.. In addition, third-party manufacturers produce many of the products Bodybuilding sells. Bodybuilding relies on these manufacturers to ensure the integrity of their ingredients and formulations. As a distributor of products manufactured by third parties, Bodybuilding may also be liable for various product liability claims for products it does not manufacture. Moreover, as a practical matter, indemnification from a product supplier is dependent on the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and its insurer, and the absence of significant defenses by the insurers. Bodybuilding may be unable to obtain full recovery from the insurer or any indemnifying third-party in respect of any claims against it in connection with products manufactured by such third-party.. Even with adequate insurance and indemnification, product liability claims could significantly damage Bodybuilding's reputation and consumer confidence in its products. Bodybuilding's litigation expenses could increase as well, which also could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued.. Bodybuilding may experience product recalls, withdrawals or seizures, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.. Bodybuilding may initiate or participate in product recalls, withdrawals or seizures if any of the products it sells are believed to cause injury or illness or if Bodybuilding is alleged to have violated governmental regulations in the labeling, promotion, sale or distribution of those products. A significant product recall, withdrawal or seizure may require significant management attention, would likely result in substantial and unexpected costs and may materially and adversely affect Bodybuilding's business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, a significant product recall, withdrawal or seizure may adversely affect consumer confidence in its brands and third-party brands sold by Bodybuilding and thus decrease consumer demand for products sold by Bodybuilding.. As is common in the VMS industry, Bodybuilding relies on its contract manufacturers and suppliers to ensure that the products they manufacture and sell to Bodybuilding comply with all applicable regulatory and legislative requirements. In general, Bodybuilding seeks representations and warranties, indemnification and insurance from its contract manufacturers and suppliers. However, even with adequate insurance and indemnification, any claims of non-compliance could significantly damage Bodybuilding's reputation and consumer confidence in its products. In addition, if products offered for sale by Bodybuilding do not comply with applicable regulatory, statutory and legislative requirements, Bodybuilding cannot market such products and may be required to recall or remove such products from the market and may face lawsuits related to any alleged non-compliance, which in certain cases could materially and adversely affect Bodybuilding's business, financial condition and results of operations.. Bodybuilding's business relies on email and other messaging services, and any restrictions on the sending of emails or messages or an inability to timely deliver such communications could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.. Bodybuilding's business is highly dependent upon email and other messaging services for promoting its sites and products. Bodybuilding provides emails and other \"push\" communications to customers and other visitors informing them of what is available for purchase on its site that day, and believes these messages are an important part of its marketing and generate a substantial portion of its revenue. If Bodybuilding is unable to successfully deliver emails or other messages to its subscribers, or if subscribers decline to open its emails or other messages, its revenue and profitability would be materially and adversely affected. Changes in how webmail applications organize and prioritize email may also reduce the number of subscribers opening its emails. Actions by third parties to block, impose restrictions on or charge for the delivery of emails or other messages could also adversely impact Bodybuilding's business. From time to time, Internet service providers or other third parties may block bulk email transmissions or otherwise experience technical difficulties that result in Bodybuilding's inability to successfully. I-39. Table of Contents. deliver emails or other messages to third parties. Changes in the laws or regulations that limit its ability to send such communications or impose additional requirements upon Bodybuilding in connection with sending such communications would also materially and adversely impact its business. Bodybuilding's use of email and other messaging services to send communications about its site or other matters may also result in legal claims against it, which may cause increased expenses, and if successful may result in fines and orders with costly reporting and compliance obligations or may limit or prohibit its ability to send emails or other messages. Bodybuilding also relies on social networking messaging services to send communications and to encourage customers to send communications. Changes to the terms of these social networking services to limit promotional communications, any restrictions that would limit Bodybuilding's ability or its customers' ability to send communications through their services, disruptions or downtime experienced by these social networking services or decline in the use of or engagement with social networking may materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.. If Bodybuilding fails to retain existing users or add new users, or if its users decrease their level of engagement with its products, Bodybuilding's business, financial condition and results of operations may be significantly harmed.. The size of Bodybuilding's user base and its users' level of engagement are critical to its success. Bodybuilding's financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by its success in adding, retaining and engaging active users. If people do not perceive its products to be useful, reliable and trustworthy, Bodybuilding may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement. Bodybuilding's user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user engagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as users continue to engage increasingly via mobile devices and as Bodybuilding introduces new and different products and services. Any number of factors could potentially negatively affect user retention, growth and engagement, including if:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tusers increasingly engage with other products or services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tBodybuilding fails to introduce new products or services that users find engaging or if it introduces new products or services that are not favorably received;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tusers have difficulty installing, updating or otherwise accessing its products on mobile devices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tuser behavior on any of Bodybuilding's products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared on its products and services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tBodybuilding is unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a variety of mobile operating systems and networks and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthere are decreases in user sentiment about the quality or usefulness of its products or concerns related to privacy and sharing, safety, security or other factors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tBodybuilding is unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is interesting, useful and relevant to them;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tusers adopt new technologies where its products may be displaced in favor of other products or services, or may not be featured or otherwise available;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthere are adverse changes in Bodybuilding's products that are mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities or litigation, including settlements or consent decrees;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttechnical or other problems prevent Bodybuilding from delivering its products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience, such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or similar content;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tBodybuilding adopts policies or procedures related to areas such as sharing or user data that are perceived negatively by its users or the general public;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tit elects to focus its user growth and engagement efforts more on longer-term initiatives, or if initiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement are unsuccessful or discontinued, whether as a result of actions by Bodybuilding, third parties or otherwise;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tBodybuilding fails to provide adequate customer service to users, marketers or developers; or. I-40. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelopers whose products are integrated with Bodybuilding or other companies in its industry are the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity.. Bodybuilding's current or future products, such as its development tools and application programming interfaces that enable developers to build, grow and monetize mobile and web applications, reduce user activity on Bodybuilding.com by making it easier for its users to interact and share on third-party mobile and web applications.. Any of the above factors could have a material and adverse effect on Bodybuilding's business, financial condition and results of operations.. The seasonality of Bodybuilding's business places increased strain on its operations.. Bodybuilding derives significant sales during the first quarter of each year. If it does not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that it fails to meet customer demand, it could significantly affect its revenue and future growth. If it overstocks products, it may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs, which could reduce profitability. If too many customers access Bodybuilding's websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, it may experience system interruptions or site performance slowdown that make its website unavailable or prevent it from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of products it sells and the attractiveness of its products and services. In addition, Bodybuilding may be unable to adequately staff its fulfillment and customer service centers during these peak periods.. Factors Relating to Expedia Holdings' Common Stock and the Securities Market. Our stock price may fluctuate significantly, particularly in response to the results of operations of Expedia and developments in its business.. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in earnings estimated by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe operating and stock price performance of comparable companies; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdomestic and foreign economic conditions.. The fair value of our investment in Expedia, on an as-converted basis, was approximately $2,827 million as of December 31, 2017,  which represents a large portion of Expedia Holdings' total market value. As a result, our stock price may move in tandem with the Expedia stock price, with the result that our stock price may be disproportionately affected by the results of operations of Expedia and developments in its business.. It may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders.. Certain provisions of our restated charter and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:. Prior to the Proxy Arrangement Termination Date:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thaving a board divided into Series B Directors and Common Stock Directors (each as defined in our restated charter), with the Series B Directors having certain powers with respect to the voting of our Expedia common stock in the election of Expedia directors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequiring that a supermajority vote of our stockholders is necessary to sell or transfer any of the shares of Expedia class B common stock held by our company;. I-41. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 70% of our voting power or the approval by at least 80% of our board of directors with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as a merger or consolidation of our company, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to our restated charter;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimiting the size of our board of directors to seven members; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thaving the proxy arrangements terminate upon a change in control of our company, with the voting power over our Expedia common stock reverting to Mr. Diller pursuant to the Diller Proxy.. Prior to and following the Proxy Arrangement Termination Date:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tauthorizing a capital structure with multiple series of common stock: a Series B that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, except in the election of Common Stock Directors prior to the Proxy Arrangement Termination Date, a Series A that entitles the holders to one vote per share and a Series C that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, entitles the holders to no voting rights;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tauthorizing the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproviding that all legal actions with respect to derivative claims and fiduciary duty claims be brought exclusively in Delaware courts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, other than in certain limited circumstances, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe existence of authorized and unissued stock which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of its management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us.. Following the Proxy Arrangement Termination Date:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tclassifying our board of directors with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 70% of our voting power or the approval by at least 75% of our board of directors with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as a merger or consolidation of our company, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to our restated charter.. Certain other provisions of the Proxy Arrangements may also have the effect of making an acquisition of our company more difficult.. Expedia Holdings is subject to ownership concentration by one principal stockholder.. Malone beneficially owns shares of our common stock representing approximately 33% of Expedia Holdings' voting power, due to his beneficial ownership of approximately 95% of the Company's outstanding Series B common stock as of January 31, 2018. Malone's equity interest in Expedia Holdings is not subject to any restrictions in favor of Expedia Holdings other than as may be required by applicable law and except for customary transfer restrictions pursuant to incentive award agreements. Malone's rights to vote or dispose of his equity interest in Expedia Holdings is, however, subject to restrictions pursuant to the terms of the Proxy Arrangements.. Until the Proxy Arrangement Termination Date, Malone and his wife have granted Mr. Diller an irrevocable proxy over the shares of Expedia Holdings common stock beneficially owned by the Malone Group (the \"Covered Shares\"). As a result, Mr. Diller will vote the Covered Shares in matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, subject to limited exceptions. As a result of the voting power attributed to the Covered Shares, Mr. Diller will also effectively be able to block certain actions by Expedia Holdings prior to the Proxy Arrangement Termination Date, including, but not limited to, certain amendments to our restated. I-42. Table of Contents. charter and bylaws and the transfer of all or any portion of the shares of Expedia class B common stock owned by Expedia Holdings. Mr. Diller will also be able to replace the Series B Directors though Malone will retain the right to remove the Series B Directors. Following the Proxy Arrangement Termination Date, Malone and his wife will resume full voting control over the Covered Shares.. Holders of a single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if an action by our directors has an adverse effect on only that series of our common stock.. Principles of Delaware law and the provisions of our restated charter may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock. Under Delaware law, the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders, including the holders of all series of our common stock. Principles of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders. As a result, in some circumstances, our directors may be required to make a decision that is viewed as adverse to the holders of one series of our common stock. Under the principles of Delaware law and the business judgment rule, holders may not be able to successfully challenge decisions that they believe have a disparate impact upon the holders of one series of our stock if our board of directors is disinterested and independent with respect to the action taken, is adequately informed with respect to the action taken and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that the board is acting in the best interest of all of our stockholders."
