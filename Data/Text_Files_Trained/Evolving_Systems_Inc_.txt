[1] "ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS. General Risk Statement. Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are driven by factors we cannot control or predict.   An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk.  The risks that we have highlighted here represent the material risks known to us, but they are not the only ones that we face. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows could be negatively affected. You should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry. We operate a global business that exposes us to currency, economic, regulatory and tax risks.. Our revenue comes primarily from sales outside the U.S. and our growth strategy is largely focused on emerging markets.  Our success delivering solutions and competing in international markets is subject to our ability to manage various risks and difficulties, including, but not limited to:.                    our ability to effectively staff, provide technical support and manage operations in multiple countries;.                    fluctuations in currency exchange rates;.                    timely collecting of accounts receivable from customers and resellers located outside of the U.S.;.                   our ability to repatriate cash from foreign locations and manage potential adverse tax consequences in connection with repatriating funds;.                   trade restrictions, political instability, disruptions in financial markets, and deterioration of economic conditions;. 8. Table of Contents.                    compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery laws and regulations;.                    variations and changes in laws applicable to our operations in different jurisdictions, including enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights; and.                    compliance with export regulations, tariffs and other regulatory barriers.. Approximately 52% of our revenue is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (e.g. British Pound Sterling, Swiss Franc and Euro).  As a result, when the U.S. dollar strengthens, our revenue, when converted to U.S. dollars, is reduced.  At the same time, approximately 75% of our operating expenses are incurred overseas. The strengthening dollar, conversely, lowers expenses outside of the U.S. Although this has provided some defense against currency fluctuations for our bottom line results, we may not be able to maintain this ratio of revenue to expense in the future.  In addition, we may not be able to repatriate cash without incurring substantial risks involving floating currency exchange rates, or to recover or apply withholding taxes remitted to foreign governments.  Any of the foregoing factors may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted and significantly affected U.S. tax law by changing how the U.S. imposes income tax on multinational corporations. The U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law and impact our results of operations in the period issued.  The Tax Act requires complex computations not previously provided in U.S. tax law. As such, the application of accounting guidance for such items is currently uncertain. Further, compliance with the Tax Act and the accounting for such provisions require accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced. As a result, we have provided a provisional estimate on the effect of the Tax Act in our financial statements. As additional regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities, as accounting treatment is clarified, as we perform additional analysis on the application of the law, and as we refine estimates in calculating the effect, our final analysis, which will be recorded in the period completed, may be different from our current provisional amounts, which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.. Our revenue, earnings and profitability are affected by the length of our sales cycle, and a longer sales cycle could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.. Our business is impacted by the length of our sales cycles.  Our customers have relatively complex businesses and the purchase of large communications solutions used for enterprise-wide, mission-critical purposes, involve significant capital expenditures and lengthy implementation plans. Prospective customers often take a long period of time to evaluate our products and services and require us to spend substantial time, effort and money educating them about our solutions. The purchase of the types of products and services we offer typically also requires coordination and agreement across many departments within a customer's organization. This process often results in a lengthy sales cycle, typically ranging between three and twelve months. Mergers and acquisitions of large communications companies, as well as the formation of new alliances, have also resulted in a purchasing delays.  Further lengthening of our sales cycle could hinder growth in our revenue and result in increased cost of sales, thereby reducing our profitability.. We depend on a limited number of significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenue, and the loss of one or more of these customers, or a delay in a large order, could adversely affect our business.. We earn a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers in the communications industry. The loss of any significant customer, delays in delivery or acceptance of any of our products by a customer, delays in performing services for a customer, or delays in collection of customer receivables could harm our business and operating results to a greater degree than other companies with a broader customer base.. Customers' budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews may cause potential customers to delay or forego a purchase, making it difficult for us to forecast the timing and size of our contracts. In addition, our sales opportunities in any given quarter and year typically include a few high value opportunities. The delay or failure to close one or more large orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and cause our results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.. Our managed services offerings and our cloud strategy, or Software as a Service (SaaS), may not be successful.. We offer some of our products as a managed service or a SaaS implementation and we intend to offer more of our solutions in this manner in the future.  While we believe the demand for managed services and cloud-based solutions is strong, there are no guarantees that we will be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or maintain profitability. Whether we are successful in providing our solutions as managed services or solutions as cloud solutions depends on our execution in a number of. 9. Table of Contents. areas, including continuing to innovate and bring to market compelling managed services and cloud-based offerings and ensuring that our services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of customer data.  Our managed and cloud-based services strategies also may fail to achieve success if other companies offering managed services and cloud-based solutions experience data loss, security breaches or service reliability issues that cause consumers to become less willing to accept managed services and cloud-based solutions in general.. We incurred debt in connection with our recent acquisitions of Lumata and SSM which could adversely affect our financial condition and restrict our operating flexibility.. In connection with our acquisition of \"Lumata Entities\" completed on September 4, 2017, we entered into a Term Loan Facility Agreement with East West Bank as lender in the amount of $4,730,000 (the \"Lumata Facility\") and we used the full amount of the Lumata Loan Facility to fund the acquisition.  The Lumata Facility requires the Company to make monthly principal payments of approximately $131,400 commencing July 31, 2018 and interest at the greater of (a) 3.5% or (b) the variable rate of interest that appears in the Wall Street Journal on a monthly measurement date, plus in either case 1.5%.  The Lumata Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. The unpaid balance of the Lumata Facility is due on August 16, 2021.. In connection with our acquisition of SSM in September 2015, we increased our revolving credit facility with East West Bank from $5.0 million to $10.0 million (the \"Revolving Facility\") and we used the full amount of the Revolving Facility to fund the acquisition.  On February 29, 2016, we retired the Revolving Facility and we entered into a term loan agreement with East West Bank (\"Term Loan\") for $6.0 million.  The Term Loan bears interest at a floating rate equal to the U.S. Prime Rate plus 1.0%, and is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets, including a pledge, subject to certain limitations with respect to stock of foreign subsidiaries, of the stock of the existing and future direct subsidiaries of the Company.  Interest accrues and is payable monthly.  We are required to repay the Term Loan in 36 equal monthly installments, commencing on January 1, 2017. The Term Loan matures on January 1, 2020.. Both in the Lumata Facility and the Term Loan (collectively, \"Loans\"), require us to maintain a minimum current ratio, a specified ratio of Total Liabilities to EBITDA and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in the Term Loan. The Loans also include negative covenants that place restrictions on the Company's ability to, among other things:  incur additional indebtedness; create liens or other encumbrances on assets; make loans, enter into letters of credit, guarantees, investments and acquisitions; sell or otherwise dispose of assets; cause or permit a change of control; merge or consolidate with another entity; make negative pledges; enter into affiliate transactions; limits the amount of cash distributions to our shareholders; and change the nature of our business materially. Outstanding amounts under the loans may be accelerated by East West Bank upon the occurrence and continuance of certain events of default, including without limitation:  payment defaults, breach of covenants beyond applicable grace periods, breach of representations and warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, and the occurrence of a material adverse effect (as defined).  Acceleration is automatic upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy and insolvency defaults.. Our debt and related obligations, including interest payments, covenants and restrictions, could have important consequences, including the following:.                   reserving cash in order to satisfy the obligations relating to our debt could adversely affect the amount or timing of investments to grow our business, impairing our ability to invest in and successfully grow our business;.                   our existing debt could limit our ability to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt obligations and other general corporate requirements;.                   our debt may increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns, competition and industry conditions and we may be unable to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting, placing us at a disadvantage to our competitors that are less leveraged; and.                   the Loans imposes restrictions on the manner in which we conduct our business, including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, incur additional debt and sell assets.. The obligations under the Loans could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. In addition, our failure to comply with the covenants under the Loans could result in an event of default and acceleration of the outstanding balance, which could significantly harm our business and cause our stock price to decline.. 10. Table of Contents. We recently completed a number of acquisitions in support of our new strategy based on recurring managed services. Acquisitions present many risks and we cannot guarantee that we will realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction.. Since September of 2015 we have acquired the Lumata Entities, BLS and SSM and we believe these acquisitions demonstrate our pivot to the customer acquisition and customer value management (\"CVM\") domains. We expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. We cannot be sure that these transactions will ultimately enhance our products or strengthen our competitive position.  These transactions involve significant challenges and risks: they may not advance our business strategy, we may not get a satisfactory return on our investment, we may have difficulty integrating operations, new technologies, products and employees, and they may distract management and employees from our other businesses. The success of these transactions will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected.. Furthermore, we may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company or technology, which could result in regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes due, a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition. In addition, future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, impact employee stock options, reduce our cash available for operations and increase our debt.  All of these factors associated with acquisitions could result in unexpected litigation from employees and stockholders. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a large acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions.. Our periodic workforce restructurings can be disruptive.. We have in the past restructured our workforce in response to management changes, acquisitions, product changes, performance issues or other considerations. These types of restructurings have resulted in increased restructuring costs and temporary reduced productivity while our staff adjusted to new roles and responsibilities. We may choose to implement additional restructuring, particularly in connection with recent or future acquisitions. There is no certainty that we will achieve the expected cost savings or other benefits of these restructurings or do so within the expected timeframe. As a result, our business, revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected.. Our products are complex and have a lengthy implementation process; unanticipated difficulties or delays in the customer acceptance process could result in higher costs and delayed payments.. Implementing our solutions can be a relatively complex and lengthy process since we typically customize these solutions for each customer's unique environment. Often our customers also require rapid deployment of our software solutions, resulting in pressure on us to meet demanding delivery and implementation schedules. Inability to meet these demanding schedules, or quality issues resulting from accelerated delivery schedules, may result in customer dissatisfaction and/or damage our reputation, which could materially harm our business.. The majority of our existing contracts provide for acceptance testing by the customer, which can be a lengthy process. Unanticipated difficulties or delays in the customer acceptance process could result in higher costs, delayed payments, and deferral of revenue recognition. In addition, if our software contains defects or we otherwise fail to satisfy acceptance criteria within prescribed times, the customer may be entitled to liquidated damages, to cancel its contract and receive a refund of all or a portion of amounts paid or to seek other monetary damages. These could exceed related contract revenue and result in a future charge to earnings. Any failure or delay in achieving final acceptance of our software and services could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. Compliance with changing European privacy laws could require us to incur significant costs and failure to comply could give rise to liabilities.. During the course of providing our products and services we may collect names, addresses, telephone numbers and other personally identifiable information, or \"PII\". This may subject us to complex regulatory requirements related to data collection and risks of improper use or disclosure.  In addition, we have offices and customers in the EU where new more stringent regulations, known as the General Data Protection Regulations or \"GDPR,\" will be going into effect in May 2018, imposing potentially large monetary fines for privacy violations. We strive to limit the amount of PII we collect and/or store and we have implemented steps designed to protect against unauthorized access to such information but because of the inherent risks and complexities involved in protecting this information, particularly if we store such information in a cloud implementation, the steps we have taken may not be sufficient to prevent the misappropriation or improper disclosure of such PII. In addition, third party vendors that we engage to perform services for us may unintentionally release PII or otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations. We may also experience hesitancy, reluctance or refusal by European or multi-national customers to continue to use our services due to the potential risk exposure that these customers might face as a result of the current data protection obligations imposed on them by certain data. 11. Table of Contents. protection authorities. These customers may decide not to do business with us or may require that their personal data remains in certain locations.  We will incur additional costs if we are required to implement special operational processes and store data in jurisdictions not of our choosing. Any failure by us to comply with laws and regulations regulating privacy, data security, or consumer protection could result in lost or restricted business, actions or fines brought against us or levied by governmental entities or others and could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation.. We face risks associated with doing business through local partners.. In some countries, because of local customs and regulations or for language reasons, we do business through local partners who resell our products and services, with or without value-added services.  This can cause delays in closing contracts because of the increased complexity of having another party involved in negotiations.  In addition, where the local partner provides additional software, hardware and/or services to the end-user customer, our products and services may only be a small portion of the total solution.  As a result, conditions surrounding acceptance and payments owed to us may be impacted by factors that are out of our control.  Resellers may also delay paying us even when they have been paid by the end-user customer.  We have in the past experienced delays in closing contracts through partners and collecting from resellers and this situation may arise again in the future, negatively impacting our cash flows.  Doing business through local partners may also increase our risks under anti-bribery regulations, discussed below.. The success of our business depends on continued growth in the wireless services industry and demand for connected devices, and other usage of mobile data.. Our primary market, wireless telecommunications is fairly mature and saturated, which may result in lower budgets and margins for our solutions and services. The future success of our business depends upon continued new subscriber growth, consumer adoption of new types of connected devices like IoT and consequently  mobile operator demand for next generation software solutions and services.  If there is a slowdown in subscriber growth in the wireless services industry or the demand for connected devices and usage of mobile data were to stabilize or decline, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.. The success of our business also depends on our ability to renew our support and managed services offerings.  The quality of our support and managed services offerings is important to our customers. If we fail to meet our service level obligations under our agreements we could incur penalties and could lose customers.. A high level of support for our solutions is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our solutions. Our customers expect us to resolve issues relating to the use of our solutions and if we are unable to meet or exceed the expectations of our customers, we could experience loss of customers and difficulty attracting new customers. In addition, we have service level agreements with many of our customers under which we guarantee specified levels of service availability and service credits for failing to achieve our agreed service levels, which could result in higher than expected costs, decreased revenues and decreased operating margins. Any of the above results would likely have a material adverse impact on our business, revenue, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.. We are a relatively small company with a limited number of products and staff.  Sales fluctuations and employee turnover may adversely affect our business.. We are a relatively small company.  Consequently, compared to larger companies, sales fluctuations have a greater impact on our revenue and profitability on a quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year basis and a delayed contract could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year-to-year.  In addition, as a small company we have limited staff and are heavily reliant on certain key personnel to operate our business. If a key employee were to leave the company it could have a material impact on our business and results of operations as we might not have sufficient depth in our staffing to fill the role that was previously being performed.  A delay in filling the vacated position could put a strain on existing personnel or result in a failure to satisfy our contractual obligations or to effectively implement our internal controls, and materially harm our business.. Because our quarterly and annual operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate, the market price for our stock may be volatile.. Our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. These quarterly and annual fluctuations may result from a number of factors, including:.                   the size of new contracts, rate of progress under our contracts and when we are able to recognize the related revenue;.                   foreign exchange fluctuations;. 12. Table of Contents.                   budgeting cycles of our customers;.                   changes in the terms and rates related to the renewal of support agreements;.                   the mix of products and services sold;.                   the timing of delivery of software and hardware by third parties;.                   level and timing of operating expenses and capital investments;.                   changes in our strategy; and.                   general economic conditions.. As a result, quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful nor do they indicate what our future performance will be.  Furthermore, we base our operating expenses and capital investment budgets on expected sales and revenue and many of our expenses, such as lease expenses, expenses associated with our debt and personnel costs, are relatively fixed in the short term. Variations in the rate and timing of conversion of our sales prospects into actual revenue could cause us to plan or budget inaccurately and we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenue. Any significant shortfall in anticipated levels of demand for our products and services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the market price of our common stock.. The markets for our service activation and number management products are mature and the markets for our next generation loyalty and customer lifecycle management software and services are evolving.  The industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological change and if we do not adapt to rapid technological change, we could lose customers or market share.. Our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in carrier requirements and preferences and frequent new service offerings. The introduction of products that incorporate new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can make existing products obsolete and unmarketable. To compete successfully, we must continue to design, develop and sell new products and enhancements to existing products that provide higher levels of performance and reliability, take advantage of technological advancements and changes in industry standards and respond to new customer requirements. Developing new products and services is complex and time-consuming. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.. If we are unable to properly supervise our software development staff in India, or if political or other uncertainties interfere, we may be unable to satisfactorily perform our customer contracts.. In 2004, we formed Evolving Systems India, a wholly owned subsidiary of Evolving Systems, Inc. and as a result of our 2015 acquisition of SSM, we acquired two additional Indian subsidiaries. We have experienced a high level of turnover with our Indian development staff as a result of strong competition for technology-based personnel in India. In addition, salary levels in India are steadily increasing, reducing the competitive advantages associated with offshore labor. If we are unable to effectively manage our India-based development staff and/or we continue to experience high levels of staff turnover, we may fail to provide quality software in a timely fashion. Furthermore, political changes and uncertainties in India could negatively impact the business climate there.  As a result, we may be unable to satisfactorily perform our customer contracts and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.. Changes or challenges to the regulations of the communication industry could hurt the market for our products and services.. Our customers may require, or we may find it necessary or advisable, to modify our products or services to address actual or anticipated changes in regulations affecting our customers. This could increase our costs, delay adoption of our products and increase our sales cycle, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  We are also subject to numerous regulatory requirements of foreign jurisdictions, which are often complex and changing.  Any failure to comply with such regulations could, likewise, materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. 13. Table of Contents. Consolidation in the communications industry may impact our financial performance.. The global communications industry has experienced and continues to experience significant consolidation.  These consolidations have caused us to lose customers and may result in fewer potential customers.  In addition, combining companies often re-evaluate their solutions and their capital expenditures, choosing to consolidate with one solution; there is no guarantee our solution will be selected in this process.  As our customers become larger, they generally have longer sales cycles and stronger purchasing power, which can result in delays in securing contracts and pressure to reduce our prices.  All of these factors can have a negative impact on our financial performance, particularly in any fiscal quarter.. Many of our products and services are sold on a fixed-price basis.  If we incur budget overruns this may reduce our profitability.. A large portion of our revenue currently is, and historically has been, derived from fixed-price contracts and we expect this will continue. These contracts specify certain obligations and deliverables we must meet regardless of the actual costs we incur. Projects done on a fixed-price basis are subject to budget overruns. On occasion, we have experienced budget overruns, resulting in lower than anticipated margins. We may incur similar budget overruns in the future, including overruns that result in losses on these contracts. If we incur budget overruns, our margins may be harmed, thereby affecting our overall profitability.. Percentage-of-completion accounting used for most of our projects can result in overstated or understated profits or losses.. The revenue for our license fee/services and fixed-price services contracts is accounted for on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.  Under this method we recognize revenue and profits for each project based on the percentage of the project that is completed, which requires us to estimate the total cost to complete the project, project schedule and completion date, and probable change orders.  Our failure to accurately estimate these often subjective factors could result in overstated or understated revenue, profits or losses.. The communications industry is highly competitive and if our products do not satisfy customer demand for performance or price, our customers could purchase products and services from our competitors.. Our primary markets are intensely competitive and we face continuous demand to release new products, new features and product enhancements, to improve product performance and to reduce prices. Our competitors include many large domestic and international companies who have substantially greater resources, larger installed customer bases and longer-standing relationships with customers. In addition, some companies who would not typically compete with us, such as network equipment manufacturers, offer next generation solutions that address some of the benefits provided by our DSA solution.. Our customers are not precluded from competing with us and also may offer competitive products or services. Many telecommunications companies have large internal development organizations, which develop software solutions and provide services similar to the products and services we provide.. We believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on numerous factors, including the quality and price of our products and services compared to those of our competitors, the emergence of new industry standards and technical innovations and our ability to respond to those changes. Some of these factors are within our control, and others are not. A variety of potential actions by our competitors, including price reductions or increased marketing and promotion, accelerated introduction of new or enhanced products, or cooperative relationships among competitors and their strategic partners, could negatively impact the sale of our products.  We may have to reduce the prices we charge for our products, resulting in lower revenue and operating margins. We may not be able to compete successfully or to properly identify and address the demands of new markets. This is particularly true in new markets where standards are not yet established. Our failure to adapt to emerging market demands, respond to regulatory and technological changes or compete successfully with existing and new competitors would materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. Our business depends largely on our ability to attract and retain talented employees.. Attracting and retaining talented employees is key to our success. The market for skilled workers in our industry is very competitive. We may not be able to retain personnel or to hire additional personnel on a timely basis, if at all. Because of the complexity of our software solutions, a significant time lag exists between the hiring date of technical and sales personnel and the time when they become fully productive. We have at times experienced high employee turnover and difficulty in recruiting and retaining technical personnel. Our failure to retain personnel or to hire qualified personnel on a timely basis could adversely affect our business by impacting our ability to develop new products, to complete our projects and secure new contracts.. 14. Table of Contents. Our products are complex and may have errors that are not detected until deployment.  Resolving warranty and product liability claims could be expensive and could negatively affect our reputation and profitability.. The provisions of our agreements with customers are designed to limit our exposure to potential liability for damages arising out of the use of, or defects in, our products.  We cannot guarantee that these limitations will be effective. Although we carry errors and omissions insurance, to the extent that any successful product liability claim is not covered by our errors and omissions insurance or exceeds the coverage under our policy, we may be required to incur legal fees and pay for a claim. This could be expensive, particularly since our software products may be used in critical business applications. On occasion, we also engage subcontractors to provide deliverables under customer contracts; we could be required to indemnify customers for work performed by our subcontractors. We may be able to recover these damages from a subcontractor, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so.  Defending against a product liability claim, regardless of its merits, could be expensive and require the time and attention of key management personnel, either of which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our business reputation could be harmed by product liability claims, regardless of their merit or the eventual outcome of these claims.. Our measures to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate.. Our success and ability to compete are dependent to a significant degree on our proprietary technology. Protecting our global intellectual property rights is difficult.  We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We have 16 patents in the U.S. on elements of our DSA and mobile broadband enablement products and patents pending in other countries on elements of our DSA and Intelligent M2M Controller<U+0099> (\"IMC\") products. In addition, we have registered or filed for registration of certain of our trademarks. Our patent portfolio is relatively small and given the cost of obtaining additional patent protection, we may choose not to patent certain inventions that later become important. There is also the possibility that our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate; a third party may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization or may develop similar technology independently or design around our patents. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not adequately protect our proprietary rights.. Source code, the detailed program commands for our software programs, is critical to our business.  While we take steps to limit access to our source code and to protect it as a trade secret, we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure.  Trade secret protection for that source code could be jeopardized, making it easier for third parties to develop competing products.. If our intellectual property protection proves inadequate, we may lose our competitive advantage and our future financial results may suffer.. Third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property rights, or that we have not complied with their license requirements and we may incur significant expenses in resolving these claims.. It is possible that our business activities may infringe upon the proprietary rights of others, or that other parties may assert infringement claims against us. Those claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue of their own, and against whom our own patents may provide little or no deterrence. We could incur substantial costs in defending against any infringement claim and we could be required to develop non-infringing technology, obtain licenses, or cease selling the applications that contain the infringing intellectual property. Adverse publicity related to any intellectual property litigation also could harm the sale of our products and damage our competitive position.. Certain software we develop or use may include so called \"open source\" software made available under a license which may impose obligations on us in the event we distribute derivative works based on the open source software.  Certain licenses impose obligations that could require us to make source code for a derivative work available to the public or license the derivative work under a particular type of open source software license, rather than the license terms we customarily use to protect our software.. There is little or no legal precedent for interpreting the terms of certain of these open source licenses, including the terms addressing the extent to which software incorporating open source software may be considered a derivative work subject to these licenses.  We believe we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable open source licenses.  However, if the owner of any open source software were to successfully establish that we had not complied with the terms of an open source license for a particular product that includes such open source software, we may be forced to release the source code for that derivative work to the public or cease distribution of that work.. 15. Table of Contents. Cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position.. Increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks have resulted in an increase in information security risks in recent years. Hackers develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack products and services and gain access to networks and data centers. A substantial portion of our software development and customer support is provided from our India facility, which may be subject to increased risk of power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks and similar events. If we were to experience difficulties maintaining existing systems or implementing new systems, we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations. Additionally, these systems contain valuable proprietary and confidential information and may contain personal data of our customers' subscribers. A security breach could result in disruptions of our internal systems and business applications, impairment of our ability to provide services to our customers, product development delays, harm to our competitive position from the compromise of confidential business information, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data. Although we believe that we have robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, many of our services do not have fully redundant systems or a formal disaster recovery plan, and we may not have adequate business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that occur from a system outage. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.  Any of these consequences would adversely affect our revenue and margins.. Disruptions from terrorist activities, geopolitical conditions or military actions may disrupt our business.. The continued threat of terrorism and acts of war may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world. Abrupt political changes and armed conflict pose a risk of economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs and add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers. Our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected to the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, delays in collecting cash, a general decrease in corporate spending on information technology, or our inability to effectively market, manufacture or ship our products. We are unable to predict whether war, political unrest and the threat of terrorism will result in any long-term commercial disruptions or if such activities will have any long-term material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.. Our international operations subject us to potential liability under anti-corruption laws and regulations.. Our international business operations are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from paying or offering anything of value to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business, or otherwise receiving discretionary favorable treatment of any kind.  To the extent we do business through Evolving Systems UK, we are also subject to the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010.  In addition, many countries in which we do business have their own anti-bribery rules and regulations. Under these regulations, we may be held liable for actions taken by our local partners and agents, even if such parties act without our knowledge.  Any determination that we have violated the FCPA or the Bribery Act of 2010 (whether directly or through acts of others, intentionally or through inadvertence) or other anti-bribery legislation could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business.  While we have procedures and controls in place to monitor compliance, situations outside of our control may arise that could put us in violation of anti-bribery legislation inadvertently and thus negatively impact our business.. As a result of operating as a smaller public company, our management is required to devote a substantial amount of time to comply with regulatory matters; our relatively small staff can make compliance challenging.. Because our common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded.  These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and NASDAQ, have issued requirements and regulations and continue to adopt additional regulations and requirements in response to laws enacted by Congress.  Establishment of effective internal controls is further complicated because we are a relatively small company with global operations, and multiple locations and IT systems.  Our management and other personnel have, and will continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives.. Changes in, or interpretations of, accounting principles or tax rules and regulations, could adversely affect our results of operations.. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). It is possible that future requirements could change our current application of U.S. GAAP, resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial positions or results of operations. In addition, our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by. 16. Table of Contents. changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.  We regularly assess our implementation of applicable accounting principles and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, but we are a relatively small company and our business is complex; the final determination of any tax authority, upon examination of our income tax returns, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") was enacted in the United States. The Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact the Company.  The income tax effects of the Tax Act in its 2017 recognized in the Company's financial statements are provisional in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provides SEC staff guidance for the application of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, in the reporting period in which the Tax Act was signed into law. As such, the Company's financial results reflect the income tax effects of the Tax Act for which accounting under ASC Topic 740 is incomplete but a reasonable estimate could be determined.. Sales of large blocks of our stock may result in the reduction in the market price of our stock and make it more difficult to raise funds in the future.. If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could fall. The perception among investors that such sales will occur could also produce this effect. We currently have several stockholders who own large percentages of our stock. To the extent we continue to have one or more stockholders who own a large percentage of our stock and those stockholders chose to liquidate their holdings, it may have a dramatic impact on the market price of our stock. These factors also could make it more difficult to raise funds through future offerings of common stock.. Certain provisions of our charter documents, employment arrangements and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of us, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.. Provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders.  In addition, these provisions, which make it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, may frustrate or prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team.  These provisions include the following:.                   our stockholders cannot take action by written consent;.                   we have advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings;.                   our stockholders can only remove directors without cause by supermajority vote; and.                   our stockholders can only amend our bylaws or certain Board of Directors-related provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation by a supermajority vote.. In addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibit us from engaging in a \"business combination\" with an \"interested stockholder\" for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in the prescribed manner. The application of Section 203 and certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control of our management, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock by discouraging or preventing takeover attempts that might result in the payment of a premium price to our stockholders.. Our named executive officers have entered into agreements with us that contain a change in control provision. These agreements generally provide for acceleration on vesting of stock awards.  The acceleration of vesting of stock awards upon a change in control may be viewed as an anti-takeover measure and may have the effect of discouraging a merger proposal, tender offer or other attempt to gain control of us.. Our Stock Incentive Plans provide for acceleration of vesting of stock awards under certain changes in control. As noted above, the acceleration on vesting of stock awards upon a change in control may be viewed as an anti-takeover measure.. All of the above factors could adversely affect the market price of our common stock by discouraging or preventing takeover attempts that might result in the payment of a premium price to our stockholders.. 17. Table of Contents. We suspended our dividends in 2016 and we may not pay dividends in the future.. In June 2016, our Board of Directors suspended our quarterly dividends. Any decision to pay dividends in the future and the amount of any dividend we may declare will depend on general business conditions, the impact of such payment on our financial condition and other factors our Board of Directors may consider to be relevant.  In addition, our Loans limit our ability to pay dividends by establishing a maximum amount that can be paid per quarter and prohibiting payment of dividends when an event of default has occurred.  If we elect to pay future dividends, this could reduce our cash reserves to levels that may be inadequate to fund expansions to our business plan or unanticipated contingent liabilities.. Our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value.. All of the factors discussed in this section, as well as general economic and market conditions, could affect our stock price. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business."
