[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. <U+FEFF>. Before you make an investment decision with respect to any of our securities, you should carefully consider all the information we have included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC. In particular, you should carefully consider the risk factors described below and the risks and uncertainties related to \"Forward-Looking Statements,\" any of which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this annual report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing Frontier. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial or that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions, may also adversely affect our business and operations. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the balance of this annual report, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report.. <U+FEFF>. Risks Related to Our Business. <U+FEFF>. We have experienced declining revenues and may experience further declines in our revenues going forward.. <U+FEFF>. We have experienced declining revenues as a result of declining voice services revenues, lower switched and nonswitched access revenues and declining video and data services revenues. Such declines have been driven primarily by customer losses, changing technology and consumer behavior (such as wireless displacement of wireline use, e-mail use, instant messaging and increasing use of VoIP), increased competition, regulatory constraints and financial decisions by governmental authorities. There can be no assurances that we will be able to stabilize or increase our revenues in the future. Future declines in our revenues could materially and adversely impact our ability to execute on our business strategy, comply with our financial covenants, repay our debts as they become due, negotiate with third parties or attract and retain employees.. <U+FEFF>. We may be unable to stabilize or grow our revenues and cash flows despite the initiatives we have implemented.. <U+FEFF>. We must produce adequate revenues and operating cash flows that, when combined with cash on hand and funds available under our revolving credit facility and other financings, will be sufficient to service our debt, fund our capital expenditures, pay our taxes, and fund our pension and other employee benefit obligations. We have experienced revenue declines in 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior years. While we have identified potential areas of opportunity and implemented several revenue and cost initiatives, we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful or that these initiatives will improve our financial position or our results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. We face intense competition.. <U+FEFF>. The communications industry is extremely competitive. Through mergers and various service expansion strategies, service providers are striving to provide integrated solutions both within and across geographic markets. Our competitors include competitive local exchange carriers, Internet service providers, wireless companies, OTT, VoIP providers and cable companies, some of which may be subject to less regulation than we are. These entities may provide services competitive with the services that we offer or intend to introduce. For example, our competitors may seek to introduce networks in our legacy markets that are competitive with or superior to our copper-based networks in those markets. We also believe that wireless and cable providers have increased their penetration of various services in our markets. We expect that competition will remain robust. Our revenue and cash flow will be adversely impacted if we cannot reverse our customer losses or continue to provide high-quality services.. <U+FEFF>. We cannot predict which of the many possible future technologies, products or services will be important in order to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these technologies, products or services. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on the effectiveness of capital expenditure investments in our properties, our marketing efforts, our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including a changing regulatory environment that may affect our business and that of our competitors differently, new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, or habits, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors. Increasing competition may. 12. FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES. reduce our revenues and increase our marketing and other costs as well as require us to increase our capital expenditures and thereby decrease our cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. Some of our competitors have superior resources, which may place us at a disadvantage.. <U+FEFF>. Some of our competitors have market presence, engineering, technical, marketing and financial capabilities, substantially greater than ours. In addition, some of these competitors are able to raise capital at a lower cost than we are able to. Consequently, some of these competitors may be able to develop and expand their communications and network infrastructures more quickly, adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services than we will be able to. Additionally, the greater brand name recognition of some competitors may require us to price our services at lower levels in order to retain or obtain customers. Finally, the cost advantages and greater financial resources of some of these competitors may give them the ability to reduce their prices for an extended period of time if they so choose. Our business and results of operations may be materially adversely impacted if we are not able to effectively compete.. <U+FEFF>. Weak economic conditions may decrease demand for our services or necessitate increased discounts.. <U+FEFF>. We could be adversely impacted by weak economic conditions or their effects. Downturns in the economy and competition in our markets have in the past, and could in the future, cause some of our customers to reduce or eliminate their purchases of our basic and enhanced voice services, broadband and video services and make it difficult for us to obtain new customers or retain existing customers. In addition, if economic conditions are depressed or further deteriorate, our customers may delay or discontinue payment for our services or seek more competitive pricing from other service providers, or we may be required to offer increased discounts in order to retain our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Disruption in our networks, infrastructure and information technology may cause us to lose customers and/or incur additional expenses.. <U+FEFF>. To attract and retain customers, we must provide reliable service. Some of the risks to our networks, infrastructure and information technology include physical damage, security breaches, capacity limitations, power surges or outages, software defects and other disruptions beyond our control, such as natural disasters and acts of terrorism. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we experience disruptions in our service due to factors such as cable damage, theft of our equipment, inclement weather and service failures of our third-party service providers. We could experience more significant disruptions in the future. We could also face disruptions due to capacity limitations if changes in our customers' usage patterns for our broadband services result in a significant increase in capacity utilization, such as through increased usage of video or peer-to-peer file sharing applications. We could also face disruptions in our networks if third-party providers elect not to continue doing business with us or put their services up for auction and we are not able to retain their services as a result. Disruptions may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers, either of which could cause us to lose customers, or increase our operating expense, all of which could adversely affect our business, revenues and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. Our business is sensitive to the creditworthiness of our wholesale customers.. <U+FEFF>. We have substantial business relationships with other communications carriers for which we provide service. While bankruptcies or insolvency of these carriers have not had a material adverse effect on our business in recent years, future bankruptcies or insolvencies in the industry could result in the loss of significant customers, as well as cause more price competition and an increased allowance for doubtful accounts receivable. Such bankruptcies and insolvencies may be more likely in the future if economic conditions stagnate. As a result, our revenues and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. A significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions.. <U+FEFF>. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 22,700 employees. Approximately 16,000 of our total employees were represented by unions and were subject to collective bargaining agreements. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 1,400 employees covered by a  collective bargaining agreement that expired in 2017, but have been extended and are still effective for 2018. Of the union-represented employees as of December 31, 2017,  approximately 4,300, or 27%, of the unionized workforce are covered by collective agreements that expire in. 13. FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES. 2018 and approximately 7,600, or 48%, of the unionized workforce are covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire in 2019.. <U+FEFF>. We cannot predict the outcome of negotiations of the collective bargaining agreements covering our employees. If we are unable to reach new agreements or renew existing agreements, employees subject to collective bargaining agreements may engage in strikes, work slowdowns or other labor actions, which could materially disrupt our ability to provide services. New labor agreements or the renewal of existing agreements may impose significant new costs on us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future.. <U+FEFF>. If we are unable to hire or retain key personnel, we may be unable to operate our business successfully.. <U+FEFF>. Our success will depend in part upon the continued services of our management. We cannot guarantee that our key personnel will not leave or compete with us. The loss, incapacity or unavailability for any reason of key members of our management team could have a material impact on our business. In addition, our financial results and our ability to compete will suffer if we are unable to attract or retain other qualified personnel in the future.. <U+FEFF>. We may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of recent acquisitions.. <U+FEFF>. In recent years, we have completed multiple acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to realize the full benefit of any anticipated growth opportunities or cost synergies from such acquisitions or that these benefits will be realized within the expected time frames.. <U+FEFF>. We have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet. We recorded goodwill impairments in 2017 and if our goodwill or other intangible assets become further impaired, we may be required to record additional non-cash charges a non-cash charge to earnings and reduce our stockholders' equity.. <U+FEFF>. Under generally accepted accounting principles, intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Frontier monitors relevant circumstances, including general economic conditions, enterprise value EBITDA multiples for other providers of communications services, our overall financial performance, and the market prices for our stock, and the potential impact that changes in such circumstances might have on the valuation of Frontier's goodwill or other intangible assets. As a result of the continued decline in the share price of our common stock in each of the four quarters in 2017, we tested goodwill for impairment. Our second and fourth quarter quantitative assessments indicated that the carrying value of the enterprise exceeded its fair value and, therefore, an impairment existed. We recorded goodwill impairments totaling $2,748 million for 2017.If our goodwill or other intangible assets are determined to be further impaired in the future, we may be required to record a non-cash charge to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined, which would reduce our stockholders' equity.. <U+FEFF>. We may complete a future significant strategic transaction that may not achieve intended results or could increase the number of our outstanding shares or amount of outstanding debt.. <U+FEFF>. We continuously evaluate and may in the future enter into additional strategic transactions. Any such transaction could happen at any time, could be material to our business and could take any number of forms, including, for example, an acquisition, merger or a sale of certain of our assets.. <U+FEFF>. Evaluating potential transactions and integrating completed ones may divert the attention of our management from ordinary operating matters. The success of these potential transactions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies through the successful integration of the businesses we acquire with our existing business. Even if we are successful in integrating acquired businesses, we cannot assure you that these integrations will result in the realization of the full benefit of any anticipated growth opportunities or cost synergies or that these benefits will be realized within the expected time frames. In addition, acquired businesses may have unanticipated liabilities or contingencies.. <U+FEFF>. If we complete an acquisition, investment or other strategic transaction, we may require additional financing that could result in an increase in the number of our outstanding shares of stock or the aggregate amount and/or cost of our debt, which may result in an adverse impact to our ratings. The number of shares of our stock or the. 14. FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES. aggregate principal amount of our debt that we may issue may be significant. Moreover, the terms of any debt financing may be expensive or adversely impact our results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. We have in the past and may in the future consider disposing of certain assets or asset groups. We may not be able to dispose of such assets on terms that are attractive to us, or at all.  To the extent we consummate such a transaction, we may experience operational challenges in segregating such assets.. <U+FEFF>. In the past, we have disposed of assets for a variety of reasons, and we may, from time to time, consider disposing of other assets or asset groups in the future. We may not be able to dispose of any such assets on terms that are attractive to us, or at all, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operation. In addition, to the extent we consummate an agreement for the sale and disposition of an asset or asset group, we may experience operational difficulties segregating them from our retained assets and operations, which could impact the execution or timing for such dispositions and could result in disruptions to our operations and/or claims for damages, among other things.. <U+FEFF>. Negotiations with the providers of content for our video systems may not be successful, potentially resulting in our inability to carry certain programming channels on our FiOS and Vantage video systems, which could result in the loss of subscribers. Alternatively, because of the power of some content providers, we may be forced to pay an increasing amount for some content, resulting in higher expenses and lower profitability.. <U+FEFF>. We must negotiate with the content owners of the programming that we carry on our multichannel video systems (marketed as FiOS video and Vantage video). These content owners are the exclusive provider of the channels they offer. If we are unable to reach a mutually-agreed contract with a content owner, including pricing and carriage provisions, our existing agreements to carry this content may not be renewed, resulting in the blackout of these channels. The loss of content could result in our loss of customers who place a high value on the particular content that is lost. In addition, many content providers own multiple channels. As a result, we typically have to negotiate the pricing for multiple channels rather than one, and carry and pay for content that customers do not value, in order to have access to other content that customers do value. Some of our competitors have materially larger scale than we do, and may, as a result, be better positioned than we are in such negotiations. As a result of these factors, the expense of content acquisition may continue to increase, and this could result in higher expenses and lower profitability.. <U+FEFF>. Risks Related to Liquidity, Financial Resources and Capitalization. <U+FEFF>. We currently have a significant amount of indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, and are contractually permitted to incur substantial additional indebtedness and grant substantial additional liens in the future. Such debt and debt service obligations may adversely affect us.. <U+FEFF>. We have a significant amount of indebtedness, which amounted to $17.9 billion outstanding at December 31, 2017, of which $3.6 billion was secured. We also have access to a $850 million secured Revolving Credit Facility, which currently is undrawn.. <U+FEFF>. The terms of our indentures and credit facilities allow us to incur substantial additional indebtedness and grant substantial additional liens in the future. In addition, these terms do not prevent us or our restricted subsidiaries from incurring various types of obligations that do not constitute \"indebtedness\" under these terms.. <U+FEFF>. If we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with our senior notes and debentures, the holders of that new debt will be entitled to share ratably with holders of our senior notes and debentures in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of Frontier. If any such additional indebtedness is secured, it will be effectively senior to our unsecured senior notes and debentures to the extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness. This may have the effect of reducing the probability of payment, or the amount of proceeds paid, to holders of our senior notes and debentures.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, to the extent other new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries' current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described below would increase.. <U+FEFF>. 15. FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES. The potential significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations that could result from our substantial debt include:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimitations on our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms or at all;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinstances in which we are unable to comply with the covenants contained in our indentures and credit agreements or to generate cash sufficient to make required debt payments, which circumstances have the potential of accelerating the maturity of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe possibility that we may trigger the springing maturity provisions in our credit agreements;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe allocation of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thus reducing the amount of our cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and dividends that would otherwise improve our competitive position, results of operations or stock price;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequiring us to issue debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompromising our flexibility to plan for, or react to, competitive challenges in our business and the telecommunications industry; and. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe possibility of our being put at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who, relative to their size, do not have as much debt as we do, and competitors who may be in a more favorable position to access additional capital resources.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, our senior notes and debentures are rated below \"investment grade\" by independent rating agencies. This has resulted in higher borrowing costs for us. We cannot assure that these rating agencies will not lower our debt ratings further, if in the rating agencies' judgment such an action is appropriate. A further lowering of a rating would likely increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital. Our negotiations with vendors, customers and business partners can be negatively impacted if they deem us a credit risk as a result of our credit rating.. <U+FEFF>. The indentures and agreements governing our debt, including our senior notes and debentures and our credit facilities, contain covenants that impose restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries that may affect our ability to operate our business, make payments on our debt, and pay dividends.. <U+FEFF>. The indentures and agreements governing our existing indebtedness contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur additional indebtedness, guarantee indebtedness or issue preferred stock;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcreate liens;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into mergers or consolidations, or transfer or sell all or substantially all of our assets;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpay dividends on, or make distributions in respect of, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock, make certain investments or make other restricted payments;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake certain asset sales;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into agreements that might prevent certain of our subsidiaries from making distributions, loans or advances to us or other subsidiaries; and. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tengage in transactions with affiliates.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, our credit facilities require us to comply with additional covenants, including financial ratios. Any future indebtedness may also require us to comply with similar or other covenants. These restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities.. 16. FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES. <U+FEFF>. Various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing indentures and agreements could result in a default under those documents and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by indentures and credit agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.. <U+FEFF>. Frontier is primarily a holding company and, as a result, we rely on the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries in order to meet our cash needs and service our indebtedness, including our senior notes and debentures.. <U+FEFF>. Frontier is primarily a holding company and its principal assets consist of the shares of capital stock or other equity instruments of its subsidiaries. As a holding company, we depend on dividends, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, including those arising under our senior notes and debentures, and meet our cash needs. We cannot assure you that the operating results of our subsidiaries at any given time will be sufficient to make dividends, distributions or other payments to us in order to allow us to make payments on our indebtedness, including our senior notes and debentures. In addition, the payment of these dividends, distributions and other payments, as well as other transfers of assets, between our subsidiaries and from our subsidiaries to us may be subject to legal, regulatory or contractual restrictions. Some state regulators have imposed and others may consider imposing on regulated companies, including us, cash management practices that could limit the ability of such regulated companies to transfer cash between subsidiaries or to the parent company. While none of the existing state regulations materially affects our cash management, any changes to the existing regulations or imposition of new regulations or restrictions may materially adversely affect our ability to transfer cash within our consolidated companies.. <U+FEFF>. Our senior notes and debentures are structurally subordinated to liabilities of our subsidiaries.. <U+FEFF>. Our subsidiaries have not guaranteed our senior notes and debentures. As a result, holders of such securities will not have any claim as a creditor against our subsidiaries. Accordingly, all obligations of our subsidiaries (including any liens granted by our subsidiaries on any of their assets to secure any of our obligations) will have to be satisfied before any of the assets of such subsidiaries would be available for distribution, upon a liquidation or otherwise. In addition, our subsidiaries may be able to incur $1.4 billion of additional debt (including secured debt), subject to the contractual limitations in our debt instruments applicable to such subsidiaries. Holders or our senior notes and debentures would be structurally subordinated to any such future debt as well.. <U+FEFF>. Our senior notes and debentures are unsecured and subordinated to any secured indebtedness.. <U+FEFF>. Our senior notes and debentures are unsecured and therefore are subordinated to our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. At December 31, 2017, our secured indebtedness consisted of obligations under the JPM Credit Agreement, the CoBank Credit Agreements, the Revolving Credit Agreement, Term Loan B and the Continuing Agreement for Standby Letters of Credit between Frontier and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch and Bank of Tokyo  -  Mitsubishi UFJ, LTD, each of which is secured by the security package under the JPM Credit Agreement which includes pledges of the equity interests in certain Frontier subsidiaries and guaranties by certain Frontier subsidiaries.  In the event of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the assets that serve as collateral for our secured indebtedness will be available to satisfy the obligations under the secured indebtedness before any payments are made on the senior notes and debentures from the proceeds of such assets. The indentures governing our senior notes and debentures permit us, subject to specified limitations, to incur a substantial amount of additional secured debt.. <U+FEFF>. Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase.. <U+FEFF>. 17. FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES. At December 31, 2017, approximately 20% of our total debt is subject to variable rates of interest. Borrowings under our credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we might not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into might not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.. <U+FEFF>. We may not have sufficient funds to repurchase our senior notes upon a change of control triggering event.. <U+FEFF>. The terms of our senior notes require us to make an offer to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control and Ratings Decline (as defined in the indentures governing the notes) at a purchase price equal to 101% of the respective principal amounts of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of the purchase. It is possible that we would not have sufficient funds at the time of such a change of control triggering event to make the required repurchase of the applicable series of notes and would be required to obtain third party financing to do so. We may not be able to obtain this financing on commercially reasonable terms, or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the occurrence of certain change of control events may constitute an event of default under the terms of our credit facilities. Such an event of default would entitle the lenders under our credit facilities to, among other things, cause all outstanding debt thereunder to become due and payable.. <U+FEFF>. Any future payment of dividends on our capital stock will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to certain important limitations, including legal and contractual restrictions.. <U+FEFF>. The amount and timing of future dividend payments, if any, on our common stock and Series A Preferred Stock will be made at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors based on factors such as cash flow and cash requirements, capital expenditures requirements, financial condition, covenants in our debt instruments and legal restrictions. Under Delaware law, our Board of Directors may only declare and pay dividends on shares of our capital stock out of our statutory \"surplus\" (which is the amount equal to total assets minus total liabilities, in each case at fair market value, minus statutory capital), or if there is no such surplus, out of our net profits for the then current or immediately preceding fiscal year. In addition, our ability to declare and pay dividends is restricted by our existing financing arrangements and may be restricted by future financing arrangements. For example, our credit agreements prohibit us from using proceeds from our revolving credit facility to fund dividend payments if the undrawn amount under the revolver is less than $250 million, and we may not pay dividends on our common stock in excess of $2.40 per share in any fiscal year. As such, there can be no assurances that we will declare and pay any future dividends on our capital stock.. <U+FEFF>. We expect to make contributions to our pension plan in future years, the amount of which will be impacted by volatility in asset values related to Frontier's pension plan and/or changes in pension plan assumptions.. <U+FEFF>. Frontier made contributions of $75 million, net of the Differential payment received (See note 17), and $28 million to its pension plan in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and we expect to continue to make contributions in future years. Volatility in our asset values, liability calculations, or returns may impact the costs of maintaining our pension plan and our future funding requirements. Any future material contribution could have a negative impact on our liquidity by reducing cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. Significant changes in discount rates, rates of return on pension assets, mortality tables and other factors could adversely affect our earnings and equity and increase our pension funding requirements.. <U+FEFF>. Pension costs and obligations are determined using actual results as well as actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions. The most critical assumptions are the discount rate, the long-term expected return on assets and mortality tables. Other assumptions include salary increases and retirement age. Some of these. 18. FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES. assumptions, such as the discount rate and return on pension assets, are reflective of economic conditions and largely out of our control. Changes in the pension assumptions could adversely affect our earnings, equity and funding requirements.. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. Risks Related to Regulation and Oversight. <U+FEFF>. Changes in federal or state regulations may reduce the switched access charge revenues we receive.. <U+FEFF>. A portion of Frontier's total revenues ($165 million, or 2%, in 2017 and $170 million, or 2%, in 2016) are derived from switched access charges paid by other carriers for services we provide in originating intrastate and interstate long-distance traffic. Frontier expects a portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from switched access charges paid by these carriers for these services. The rates Frontier can charge for switched access are regulated by the FCC and state regulatory agencies.. <U+FEFF>. In 2011, the FCC adopted the 2011 Order regarding Intercarrier Compensation, which is the payment framework that governs how carriers compensate each other for the exchange of voice traffic between carriers. The 2011 Order began a multi-year transition that moves the rate for terminating traffic to near zero by 2017, with the final phase down of a subset of traffic in 2018. Additionally, the 2011 Order requires VoIP providers to pay interstate terminating interconnection charges and requires all carriers terminating traffic to provide appropriate call information, thus prohibiting so-called \"phantom traffic.\" The FCC also reformed the Universal Service Fund in this order to shift the High-Cost portion of the fund from supporting voice services to supporting broadband deployment in high-cost areas.. <U+FEFF>. However, the 2011 Order did not resolve all questions on Intercarrier Compensation.  The FCC continues to consider the possibility of transitioning originating access rates in the future. We cannot predict when or how the FCC would implement any changes originating access rates, and future reductions in these revenues may directly affect our profitability and cash flows as these regulatory revenues do not have an equal level of associated variable expenses.. <U+FEFF>. In August 2017, the FCC decision to deregulate the market for special access services where the market is determined to be competitive and the transport market nationwide became effective.  Some aspects of that decision are under appeal by stakeholders.  We cannot predict the outcome of that appeal or the impact of future changes on our results or operations.. <U+FEFF>. Certain states also have their own open proceedings to address reform to originating intrastate access charges, other intercarrier compensation, and state universal service funds. Although the FCC has pre-empted state jurisdiction on most access charges, many states could consider moving forward with their proceedings. We cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided or the effect on our subsidy or switched access revenues. However, future reductions in our subsidy or switched access revenues may directly affect our profitability and cash flows as those regulatory revenues do not have an equal level of associated variable expenses.. <U+FEFF>. A portion of Frontier's revenues are derived from federal and state subsidies. To the extent the federal or any state government reduces such subsidies, our operating income could be materially and adversely impacted.. <U+FEFF>. A portion of Frontier's total revenues ($395 million, or 4%, in 2017 and $409 million, or 5%, in 2016) are derived from federal and state subsidies for rural and high-cost support, that consists of CAF II support, Federal High Cost support, and various state subsidies. The FCC's 2011 Order changed how federal subsidies are calculated and disbursed. These changes transitioned the USF (Universal Service Fund), which supported voice services in high-cost areas, to the CAF (Connect America Fund), which supports broadband deployment in high-cost areas. Federal subsidies represented approximately 92% of subsidy revenue in 2017 and 89% in 2016, with the remainder being state subsidies.. <U+FEFF>. Frontier is required to contribute to the Universal Service Fund.  The FCC allows Frontier to recover these contributions through a USF Surcharge on customers' bills.  This surcharge accounted for $216 million of revenue in 2017 and $217 million in 2016.. <U+FEFF>. 19. FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES. Future reductions in these subsidies, or in our ability to recover Universal Service Fund contributions, could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Frontier and our industry will likely remain highly regulated, and we could incur substantial compliance costs that could constrain our ability to compete in our target markets.. <U+FEFF>. As an incumbent local exchange carrier, some of the services we offer are subject to significant regulation from federal, state and local authorities. This regulation could impact our ability to change our rates, especially on our basic voice services and our access rates, and could impose substantial compliance costs on us. In some jurisdictions, regulation may restrict our ability to expand our service offerings. In addition, changes to the regulations that govern our business (including any implementation of the 2011 Order) may have an adverse effect on our business by reducing the allowable fees that we may charge, imposing additional compliance costs, reducing the amount of subsidies or otherwise changing the nature of our operations and the competition in our industry. At this time, it is unknown how these regulations will affect Frontier's operations or ability to compete in the future.. <U+FEFF>. Other FCC rulemakings and state regulatory proceedings, including those relating to intercarrier compensation, universal service and broadband services, could have a substantial adverse impact on our operations.. <U+FEFF>. In December 2017, the FCC voted to roll back the FCC's 2015 Order applying the Title II framework to broadband services.  This decision restores the light touch regulatory treatment of broadband service in place prior to 2015 and preserves the FCC's transparency requirements.  The decision also clarifies that the Federal Trade Commission is the proper venue for enforcement of the transparency requirements and privacy practices.  Several parties are expected to appeal this order and may seek a stay of its provisions.. <U+FEFF>. Our Internet access offerings could become subject to additional laws and regulations as they are adopted or applied to the Internet. As the significance of the Internet expands, federal, state and local governments may pass laws and adopt rules and regulations, including those directed at privacy, or apply existing laws and regulations to the Internet (including Internet access services), and related matters are under consideration in both federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies. Although the FCC has pre-empted state jurisdiction on network neutrality and privacy, many states could consider moving forward with legislation on these or other Internet-related issues. At least two states, Montana and New York have already taken executive action directed at reinstating aspects of the FCC's 2015 Order.  We cannot predict whether the outcome of expected or pending challenges to the FCC's order or future proceedings will prove beneficial or detrimental to our competitive position.. <U+FEFF>. We are subject to the oversight of certain federal and state agencies that have in the past, and may in the future, investigate or pursue enforcement actions against us relating to consumer protection matters.. <U+FEFF>. Certain federal and state agencies, including state attorneys general, monitor and exercise oversight related to consumer protection matters, including those affecting the communications industry. Such agencies have in the past, and may in the future, choose to launch an inquiry or investigation of our business practices in response to customer complaints or other publicized customer service issues or disruptions. Such inquiries or investigations could result in reputational harm, enforcement actions, litigation, fines, settlements and/or operational and financial conditions being placed on the company, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business.. <U+FEFF>. 20. FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES. Tax legislation may adversely affect our business and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. Tax laws are dynamic and continually change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA). The TCJA makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code and, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, and imposes limitations on the use of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate results in a decreased valuation of our deferred tax asset and liabilities. The overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law. The determination of the benefit from (provision for) income taxes requires complex estimations, significant judgments and significant knowledge and experience concerning the applicable tax laws. Given that we are still in the transition period for the accounting for income tax effects of the TCJA, the current assessment on deferred tax assets (liabilities) is based on the currently available information and guidance. If in the future any element of the tax reform changes the related accounting guidance for income tax, it could affect our income tax position and we may need to adjust the benefit from (provision for) income taxes accordingly.. <U+FEFF>. Risks Related to Technology. <U+FEFF>. We may be unable to meet the technological needs or expectations of our customers, and may lose customers as a result.. <U+FEFF>. The telecommunications industry is subject to significant changes in technology, and replacing or upgrading our infrastructure to keep pace with such technological changes could result in significant capital expenditures. If we do not replace or upgrade technology and equipment and manage broadband speeds and capacity as necessary, we may be unable to compete effectively because we will not be able to meet the needs or expectations of our customers.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, enhancements to product offerings may influence our customers to consider other service providers, such as cable operators or wireless providers. We may be unable to attract new or retain existing customers from cable companies due to their deployment of enhanced broadband and VoIP technology. In addition, new capacity services for wireless broadband technologies may permit our competitors to offer broadband data services to our customers throughout most or all of our service areas. Any resulting inability to attract new or retain existing customers could adversely impact our business and results of operations in a material manner.. <U+FEFF>. We rely on network and information systems and other technology, and a disruption or failure of such networks, systems or technology as a result of computer viruses, cyber-attacks, misappropriation of data or other malfeasance, as well as outages, accidental releases of information or similar events, may disrupt our business and materially impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. We maintain security measures, disaster recovery plans and business continuity plans for our business and are continuously working to upgrade our existing technology systems and provide employee training around the cyber risks we face. Nevertheless, our information technology networks and infrastructure may be subject to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, cyber-attacks or breaches, employee or third-party error or malfeasance, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters or other catastrophic events.. <U+FEFF>. Further, our network and information systems are subject to various risks related to third parties and other parties we may not fully control. We use encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide secure transmission of confidential information, including our business data and customer information. Similarly, we rely on employees in our network operations centers, data centers, call centers and retail stores to follow our procedures when handling sensitive information. While we select our third-party business partners and employees carefully, we do not always control their actions, which could expose us to cyber-security risks. In addition, our customers using our network to access the Internet may become victim to malicious and abusive Internet activities, such as unsolicited mass advertising (or spam), peer-to-peer file sharing, distribution of viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software; these activities could adversely affect our network, result in excessive call volume at our call centers and damage our or our customers' equipment and data.. <U+FEFF>. 21. FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES. Any unauthorized access, computer viruses, accidental or intentional release of confidential information or other disruptions could result in misappropriation of our or our customers' sensitive information; reputational harm; increased costs, such as those relating to remediation or future protection; customer dissatisfaction, which could lead to a decline in customers and revenue; and legal claims or proceedings, fines and other liabilities. There can be no assurance that the impact of such incidents would not be material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. 22.
