[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. You should consider carefully the risk factors discussed below, as well as all other information, as an investment in the Company involves a high degree of risk. We are subject to certain risks and hazards due to the nature of the business activities we conduct. The risks discussed below, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations, could result in a partial or total loss of your investment, and are not the only risks we face. We may experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or, as a result of developments occurring in the future, conditions that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.. Our operating results will be adversely affected if we continue to experience significant net customer attrition in our home heating oil and propane customer base.. The following table depicts our gross customer gains, gross customer losses and net customer attrition from fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2017. Net customer attrition is the difference between gross customer losses and customers added through marketing efforts. Customers added through acquisitions are not included in the calculation of gross customer gains. However, additional customers that are obtained through marketing efforts at newly acquired businesses are included in these calculations. Customer attrition percentage calculations include customers added through acquisitions in the denominators of the calculations on a weighted average basis.. Fiscal Year Ended September 30,       2017     2016     2015     2014     2013   Gross customer gains      13.1 %      12.1 %      14.6 %      16.0 %      14.8 %  Gross customer losses      14.6 %      17.2 %      16.4 %      16.9 %      18.1 %                                                     Net attrition      (1.5 %)      (5.1 %)      (1.8 %)      (0.9 %)      (3.3 %). The gain of a new customer does not fully compensate for the loss of an existing customer because of the expenses incurred during the first year to add a new customer. Typically, the per gallon margin realized from a new account added is less than the margin of a customer that switches to another provider. Customer losses are the result of various factors, including but not limited to:. <U+0095>   price competition;. <U+0095>   customer relocations and home sales/foreclosures;. <U+0095>   conversions to natural gas; and. <U+0095>   credit worthiness.. The continuing volatility in the energy markets can intensify price competition and add to our difficulty in reducing net customer attrition. Warmer than normal weather can also contribute to an increase in attrition as customers perceive less need for a full service provider like ourselves.. 11. Table of Contents. If we are not able to reduce the current level of net customer attrition or if such level should increase, attrition will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and cash available for distributions to unitholders. For additional information about customer attrition, see Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  -  Customer Attrition.\". Because of the highly competitive nature of our business, we may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers, which would have an adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.. Our business is subject to substantial competition. Most of our operating locations compete with numerous distributors, primarily on the basis of price, reliability of service and responsiveness to customer service needs. Each operating location operates in its own competitive environment.. We compete with distributors offering a broad range of services and prices, from full-service distributors, such as ourselves, to those offering delivery only. As do many companies in our business, we provide home heating equipment repair service on a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week, 52 weeks a year basis. We believe that this tends to build customer loyalty. In some instances homeowners have formed buying cooperatives that seek to purchase home heating oil from distributors at a price lower than individual customers are otherwise able to obtain. We also compete for retail customers with suppliers of alternative energy products, principally natural gas, propane (in the case of our home heating oil operations) and electricity. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose existing customers and/or fail to acquire new customers, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.. Based on data in the 2010 United States Census, from 2000 to 2010 it appears that heating oil customer conversions to natural gas in the states where we do business averaged from under 1% to over 3% per year.. The following table depicts our estimated customer losses to natural gas conversions for the last five fiscal years. Losses to natural gas in our footprint for the home heating oil industry could be greater or less than our estimates. We believe conversions will continue as natural gas has become less expensive than home heating oil on an equivalent BTU basis. In addition, certain states encourage homeowners to expand the use of natural gas as a heating fuel through legislation and regulatory efforts.. Fiscal Year Ended September 30,       2017     2016     2015     2014     2013   Customer losses to natural gas conversion      (1.2 )%      (1.3 )%      (1.6 )%      (2.2 )%      (2.4 )%. In addition to our direct customer losses to natural gas competition, any conversion to natural gas by a heating oil consumer in our geographic footprint reduces the pool of available customers from which we can gain new heating oil customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.. Energy efficiency and new technology may reduce the demand for our products and adversely affect our operating results.. Increased conservation and technological advances, including installation of improved insulation and the development of more efficient furnaces and other heating devices, have adversely affected the demand for our products by retail customers. Future conservation measures or technological advances in heating, conservation, energy generation or other devices might reduce demand and adversely affect our operating results.. 12. Table of Contents. If we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, our future growth will be limited.. Generally, heating oil and propane are alternative energy sources to new housing construction, because natural gas is usually selected when natural gas infrastructure exists. In certain geographies, utilities are building out their natural gas infrastructure. As such, our industry is not a growth industry. Accordingly, future growth will depend on our ability to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms. We cannot assure that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates in our sector in the future or that we will be able to acquire businesses on economically acceptable terms. Factors that may adversely affect our operating and financial results may limit our access to capital and adversely affect our ability to make acquisitions. Under the terms of our third amended and restated credit agreement that we sometimes refer to in this Report as our credit agreement, we are restricted from making any individual acquisition in excess of $25.0 million without the lenders' approval. In addition, to make an acquisition, we are required to have Availability (as defined in our credit agreement) of at least $40.0 million, on a historical pro forma and forward-looking basis. Furthermore, as long as the bank term loan is outstanding, we must be in compliance with the senior secured leverage ratio (as defined in our credit agreement). These covenant restrictions may limit our ability to make acquisitions. Any acquisition may involve potential risks to us and ultimately to our unitholders, including:. <U+0095>   an increase in our indebtedness;. <U+0095>   an increase in our working capital requirements;. <U+0095>   an inability to integrate the operations of the acquired business;. <U+0095>   an inability to successfully expand our operations into new territories;. <U+0095>   the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;. <U+0095>   an excess of customer loss from the acquired business;. <U+0095>   loss of key employees from the acquired business; and. <U+0095>   the assumption of additional liabilities including environmental liabilities.. In addition, acquisitions may be dilutive to earnings and distributions to unitholders, and any additional debt incurred to finance acquisitions may, among other things, affect our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.. High product prices can lead to customer conservation and attrition, resulting in reduced demand for our products.. Prices for our products are subject to volatile fluctuations in response to changes in supply and other market conditions. During periods of high product costs our prices generally increase. High prices can lead to customer conservation and attrition, resulting in reduced demand for our products.. A significant portion of our home heating oil volume is sold to price-protected customers (ceiling and fixed) and our gross margins could be adversely affected if we are not able to effectively hedge against fluctuations in the volume and cost of product sold to these customers.. A significant portion of our home heating oil volume is sold to individual customers under an arrangement pre-establishing the ceiling sales price or a fixed price of home heating oil over a fixed period. When the customer makes a purchase commitment for the next period we currently purchase option contracts, swaps and futures contracts for a substantial majority of the heating oil that we expect to sell to these price-protected customers. The amount of home heating oil volume that we hedge per price-protected customer is based upon the estimated fuel consumption per average customer, per month. If the actual usage exceeds the amount of the hedged volume on a monthly basis, we could be required to obtain additional volume at unfavorable margins. In addition, should actual usage in any month be less than the hedged volume, (including, for example, as a result of early terminations by fixed price customers) our hedging losses could be greater. Currently, we have elected not to designate our derivative instruments as hedging instruments under FASB ASC 815-10-05 Derivatives and Hedging, and the change in fair value of the derivative instruments is recognized in our statement of operations. Therefore, we experience volatility in earnings as these currently outstanding derivative contracts are marked to market and non-cash gains or losses are recorded in the statement of operations.. 13. Table of Contents. Our risk management policies cannot eliminate all commodity risk, basis risk, or the impact of adverse market conditions which can adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. In addition, any noncompliance with our risk management policies could result in significant financial losses.. While our hedging policies are designed to minimize commodity risk, some degree of exposure to unforeseen fluctuations in market conditions remains. For example, we change our hedged position daily in response to movements in our inventory. Any difference between the estimated future sales from inventory and actual sales will create a mismatch between the amount of inventory and the hedges against that inventory, and thus change the commodity risk position that we are trying to maintain. Also, significant increases in the costs of the products we sell can materially increase our costs to carry inventory. We use our revolving credit facility as our primary source of financing to carry inventory and may be limited on the amounts we can borrow to carry inventory. Basis risk describes the inherent market price risk created when a commodity of certain grade or location is purchased, sold or exchanged as compared to a purchase, sale or exchange of a like commodity at a different time or place. Transportation costs and timing differentials are components of basis risk. For example, we use the NYMEX to hedge our commodity risk with respect to pricing of energy products traded on the NYMEX. Physical deliveries under NYMEX contracts are made in New York Harbor. To the extent we take deliveries in other ports, such as Boston Harbor, we may have basis risk. In a backward market (when prices for future deliveries are lower than current prices), basis risk is created with respect to timing. In these instances, physical inventory generally loses value as basis declines over time. Basis risk cannot be entirely eliminated, and basis exposure, particularly in backward or other adverse market conditions, can adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.. We monitor processes and procedures to reduce the risk of unauthorized trading and to maintain substantial balance between purchases and sales or future delivery obligations. We can provide no assurance, however, that these steps will detect and/or prevent all violations of such risk management policies and procedures, particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved.. Since weather conditions may adversely affect the demand for home heating oil and propane, our business, operating results and financial condition are vulnerable to warm winters.. Weather conditions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions in which we operate have a significant impact on the demand for home heating oil and propane because our customers depend on this product principally for space heating purposes. As a result, weather conditions may materially adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. During the peak-heating season of October through March, sales of home heating oil and propane historically have represented approximately 80% of our annual oil volume. Actual weather conditions can vary substantially from year to year or from month to month, significantly affecting our financial performance. Warmer than normal temperatures in one or more regions in which we operate can significantly decrease the total volume we sell and the gross profit realized and, consequently, our results of operations. In fiscal years 2017, 2016, 2012 and 2002 temperatures were significantly warmer than normal for the areas in which we sell our products, which adversely affected the amount of net income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA that we generated during these periods.. To partially mitigate the adverse effect of warm weather on cash flows, we have used weather hedge contracts for a number of years. In general, such weather hedge contracts provide that we are entitled to receive a specific payment per heating degree-day shortfall, when the total number of heating degree-days in the hedge period is less than the ten year average. The \"payment thresholds,\" or strikes, are set at various levels. The hedge period runs from November 1, through March 31, of a fiscal year taken as a whole.. For fiscal year 2018 and 2019 we have weather hedge contracts with several providers. For fiscal year 2018 the maximum that the Company can receive is $17.5 million and the maximum the Company can pay is $5.0 million. For fiscal year 2019 the maximum that the Company can receive is $12.5 million and the maximum the Company can pay is $5.0 million. However, there can be no assurance that such weather hedge contract would fully or substantially offset the adverse effects of warmer weather on our business and operating results during such period.. 14. Table of Contents. Failure to effectively estimate employer-sponsored health insurance premiums and incremental costs due to the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \"ACA\") or other healthcare reform laws could materially and adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. In March 2010, the United States federal government enacted comprehensive health care reform legislation, which, among other things, includes guaranteed coverage requirements, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits, restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded, and imposes new taxes on health insurers, self-insured companies, and health care benefits. The legislation imposes implementation effective dates that began in 2010 and extend through 2020 with many of the changes requiring additional guidance from federal agencies and regulations. Possible adverse effects could include increased costs, exposure to expanded liability, and requirements for us to revise the ways in which healthcare and other benefits are provided to employees. Efforts to modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA and/or adopt a replacement healthcare reform law may impact our employee healthcare costs. At this time, there is uncertainty concerning whether the ACA will be repealed or what requirements will be included in a new law, if enacted. Increased health care and insurance costs as well as other changes in federal or state workplace regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. Our obligation to fund multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute may have an adverse impact on us.. We participate in a number of multi-employer pension plans for current and former union employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. The risks of participating in multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans in that assets contributed are pooled and may be used to provide benefits to current and former employees of other participating employers. Several factors could require us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans, including the funding status of the plan, unfavorable investment performance, insolvency or withdrawal of participating employers, changes in demographics and increased benefits to participants. Several of these multi-employer plans to which we contribute are underfunded, meaning that the value of such plans' assets are less than the actuarial value of the plans' benefit obligations.. We may be subject to additional liabilities imposed by law as a result of our participation in multi-employer defined benefit pension plans. Various Federal laws impose certain liabilities upon an employer who is a contributor to a multi-employer pension plan if the employer withdraws from the plan or the plan is terminated or experiences a mass withdrawal, potentially including an allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits in the plan for all plan participants, not just our retirees. Accordingly, we could be assessed our share of unfunded liabilities should we terminate participation in these plans, or should there be a mass withdrawal from these plans, or if the plans become insolvent or otherwise terminate.. While we currently have no intention of permanently terminating our participation in or otherwise withdrawing from any underfunded multi-employer pension plan, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to record material withdrawal liabilities or be required to make material cash contributions in the future to one or more underfunded plans, whether as a result of withdrawing from a plan, or of agreeing to any alternate funding option, or due to any of the other risks associated with being a participating employer in an underfunded plan. Any of these events could negatively impact our liquidity and financial results.. We rely on the continued solvency of our derivatives, insurance and weather hedge counterparties.. If counterparties to the derivative instruments that we use to hedge the cost of home heating oil sold to price-protected customers, physical inventory and our vehicle fuel costs were to fail, our liquidity, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted, as we would be obligated to fulfill our operational requirement of purchasing, storing and selling home heating oil and vehicle fuel, while losing the mitigating benefits of economic hedges with a failed counterparty. If one of our insurance carriers were to fail, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted, as we would have to fund any catastrophic loss. If our weather hedge counterparty were to fail, we would lose the protection of our weather hedge contract. Currently, we have outstanding derivative instruments with the following counterparties: Bank of America, N.A., Bank of Montreal, Cargill, Inc., Citibank, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Key Bank, N.A., Munich Re Trading LLC, Regions Financial Corporation, Societe Generale, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Our primary insurance carriers are American International Group, Federated Mutual Insurance Company, our captive insurance subsidiary, Woodbury Insurance Co., Inc., and our weather hedge counterparties which are subsidiaries of Swiss Re and Endurance Specialty Insurance Ltd.. 15. Table of Contents. Our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations.. Our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations since the demand for home heating oil and propane is greater during the first and second fiscal quarter of our fiscal year, which is the peak heating season. The seasonal nature of our business has resulted on average in the last five years in the sale of approximately 30% of our volume of home heating oil and propane in the first fiscal quarter and 50% of our volume in the second fiscal quarter of each fiscal year. As a result, we generally realize net income in our first and second fiscal quarters and net losses during our third and fourth fiscal quarters and we expect that the negative impact of seasonality on our third and fourth fiscal quarter operating results will continue. Thus any material reduction in the profitability of the first and second quarters for any reason, including warmer than normal weather, generally cannot be made up by any significant profitability improvements in the results of the third and fourth quarters.. Increases in wholesale product costs may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Increases in wholesale product costs may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the following:. <U+0095>   customer conservation or attrition due to customers converting to lower cost heating products or suppliers;. <U+0095>   reduced liquidity as a result of higher receivables, and/or inventory balances as we must fund a portion of any increase in receivables, inventory and hedging costs from our own resources, thereby tying up funds that would otherwise be available for other purposes;. <U+0095>   higher bad debt expense and credit card processing costs as a result of higher selling prices;. <U+0095>   higher interest expense as a result of increased working capital borrowing to finance higher receivables and/or inventory balances; and. <U+0095>   higher vehicle fuel costs.. Volatility in wholesale energy costs may adversely affect our liquidity.. Our business requires a significant amount of working capital to finance accounts receivable and inventory during the heating season. Under our revolving credit facility, we may borrow up to $300 million, which increases to $450 million during the peak winter months from December through April of each fiscal year. We are obligated to meet certain financial covenants under our credit agreement, including the requirement to maintain at all times either excess availability (borrowing base less amounts borrowed and letters of credit issued) of 12.5% of the revolving credit commitment then in effect or a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in our credit agreement) of not less than 1.1. In addition, as long as our term loan is outstanding, our senior secured leverage ratio cannot at any time be more than 3.0 as calculated during the quarters ending June or September, and cannot at any time be more than 4.5 as calculated during the quarters ending December or March.. If increases in wholesale product costs cause our working capital requirements to exceed the amounts available under our revolving credit facility or should we fail to maintain the required availability or fixed charge coverage ratio, we would not have sufficient working capital to operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. We purchase synthetic call options from and enter into forward swaps with members of our lending group to manage market risk associated with our commitments to our customers, our physical inventory and fuel we use for our vehicles. These institutions have not required an initial cash margin deposit or any mark to market maintenance margin for these derivatives. Any mark to market exposure reduces our borrowing base and can thus reduce the amount available to us under our credit agreement. The highest mark to market reserve against our borrowing base for these derivative instruments with our lending group was $7.8 million, $25.2 million, and $28.9 million, during fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.. We also purchase call options to hedge the price of the products to be sold to our price-protected customers which usually require us to pay an upfront cash payment. This reduces our liquidity, as we must pay for the option before any sales are made to the customer. We also purchase synthetic call options which require us to pay for these options as they expire.. 16. Table of Contents. For certain of our supply contracts, we are required to establish the purchase price in advance of receiving the physical product. This occurs at the end of the month and is usually 20 days prior to receipt of the product. We use futures contracts or swaps to \"short\" the purchase commitment such that the commitment floats with the market. As a result, any upward movement in the market for home heating oil would reduce our liquidity, as we would be required to post additional cash collateral for a futures contract or our availability to borrow under our credit agreement would be reduced in the case of a swap.. At December 31, 2017, we expect to have approximately 30 million gallons of priced purchase commitments and physical inventory hedged with a futures contract or swap. If the wholesale price of heating oil increased $1.00 per gallon, our near term liquidity in December would be reduced by $30 million.. At September 30, 2017, we had approximately 131,000 customers, or 34% of our residential customer base, on the balanced payment plan in which a customer's estimated annual oil purchases and service contract fees are paid for in a series of equal monthly payments. Volatility in wholesale prices could reduce our liquidity if we failed to recalculate the balanced payments on a timely basis or if customers resist higher balanced payments. These customers could possibly owe us more in the future than we had budgeted. Generally, customer credit balances are at their low point after the end of the heating season and at their peak prior to the beginning of the heating season.. Sudden and sharp oil price increases that cannot be passed on to customers may adversely affect our operating results.. Our industry is a \"margin-based\" business in which gross profit depends on the excess of sales prices per gallon over supply costs per gallon. Consequently, our profitability is sensitive to changes in the wholesale product cost caused by changes in supply or other market conditions. These factors are beyond our control and thus, when there are sudden and sharp increases in the wholesale cost of home heating oil, we may not be able to pass on these increases to customers through increased retail sales prices. In an effort to retain existing accounts and attract new customers we may offer discounts, which will impact the net per gallon gross margin realized.. Significant declines in the wholesale price of home heating oil may cause price-protected customers to renegotiate or terminate their arrangements which may adversely impact our gross profit and operating results.. When the wholesale price of home heating oil declines significantly after a customer enters into a price protection arrangement, some customers attempt to renegotiate their arrangement in order to enter into a lower cost pricing plan with us or terminate their arrangement and switch to a competitor. As a result of significant decreases in the price of home heating oil following the summer of 2008, many price-protected customers attempted to renegotiate their agreements with us in fiscal 2009. It is our policy to bill a termination fee when customers terminate their arrangement with us. We believe that approximately 10,000 customers terminated their relationship with us as a result of being billed the termination fee in fiscal 2009. Under our current price-protected programs, approximately 37% and 10% of our residential customers are respectively categorized as being either ceiling or fixed.. Economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.. Uncertainty about economic conditions poses a risk as our customers may reduce or postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on the demand for our equipment and services and could lead to increased conservation, as we have seen certain of our customers seek lower cost providers. Any increase in existing customers or potential new customers seeking lower cost providers and/or increase in our rejection rate of potential accounts because of credit considerations could increase our overall rate of net customer attrition. In addition, we could experience an increase in bad debts from financially distressed customers, which would have a negative effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.. 17. Table of Contents. We are subject to operating and litigation risks that could adversely affect our operating results whether or not covered by insurance.. Our operations are subject to all operating hazards and risks normally incidental to handling, storing, transporting and otherwise providing customers with our products such as natural disasters, adverse weather, accidents, fires, explosions, hazardous materials releases, mechanical failures and other events beyond our control. If any of these events were to occur, we could incur substantial losses because of personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, and pollution or other environmental damage resulting in curtailment or suspension of our related operations. As a result, we may be a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable.. As we self-insure workers' compensation, automobile and general liability claims up to pre-established limits, we establish reserves based upon expectations as to what our ultimate liability will be for claims based on our historical factors. We evaluate on an annual basis the potential for changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries. As of September 30, 2017, we had approximately $63.9 million of net insurance reserves. Other than matters for which we self-insure, we maintain insurance policies with insurers in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent.. However, there can be no assurance that the ultimate settlement of these claims will not differ materially from the assumptions used to calculate the reserves or that the insurance we maintain will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for remediation costs and personal and property damage or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices, either of which could have a material effect on our results of operations. Further, certain types of claims may be excluded from our insurance coverage. If we were to incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits, or if we incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.. Our captive insurance company may not bring the benefits we expect.. Beginning October 1, 2016, we have elected to insure through a wholly-owned captive insurance company, Woodbury Insurance Co., Inc., certain self insured or deductible amounts. We continue to maintain our normal, historical, insurance policies with third party insurers. In addition to certain business and operating benefits of having a captive insurance company, we expect to receive certain cash flow benefits related to the timing of the tax deduction related to these claims. Such expected cash tax timing benefits related to coverage provided by Woodbury Insurance Co., Inc. may not materialize, or any cash tax savings may not be as much as anticipated.. Our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by governmental regulation and associated environmental and regulatory costs.. Our business is subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations related to environmental and other matters. Such laws and regulations have become increasingly stringent over time. Some state and local governments have enacted or are attempting to enact regulations and incentive programs encouraging the phase-out of the products that we sell in favor other types of fuels, such as natural gas. We may experience increased costs due to stricter pollution control requirements or liabilities resulting from noncompliance with operating or other regulatory permits. New regulations might adversely impact operations, including those relating to underground storage, transportation and delivery of the products that we sell. In addition, there are environmental risks inherently associated with home heating oil operations, such as the risks of accidental releases or spills. We have incurred and continue to incur costs to remediate soil and groundwater contamination at some of our locations. We cannot be sure that we have identified all such contamination, that we know the full extent of our obligations with respect to contamination of which we are aware, or that we will not become responsible for additional contamination not yet discovered. It is possible that material costs and liabilities will be incurred, including those relating to claims for damages to property and persons.. 18. Table of Contents. In addition, our financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay distributions to our unitholders may be negatively impacted by significant changes in federal and state tax law. For example, an increase in federal and state income tax rates will reduce the amount of cash to pay distributions.. There is increasing attention in the United States and worldwide concerning the issue of climate change and the effect of emissions of greenhouse gases (\"GHG\"), in particular from the combustion of fossil fuels. Federal, regional and state regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions have begun taking steps to regulate GHG emissions. For example in October 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") issued its final \"Clean Power Plan\" for regulation of GHG emissions. Under the Clean Power Plan, the EPA will set state-specific goals for GHG emissions reductions, leaving the states with flexibility to determine how to achieve such goals. The Clean Power Plan is currently the subject of multiple judicial challenges and it is unclear what, if any, effect the results of the 2016 elections will have on the Clean Power Plan. But even if the Clean Power Plan is ultimately upheld by the courts, it is too early to predict how the states where we operate or from which we obtain our products will elect to control GHG emissions. Further, irrespective of federal legislation and regulation, individual states or cities may enact laws and regulations controlling GHG emissions. It is likely that any regulatory program that caps emissions or imposes a carbon tax will increase costs for us and our customers, which could lead to increased conservation or customers seeking lower cost alternatives. We cannot yet estimate the compliance costs or business impact of potential national, regional or state greenhouse gas emissions reduction legislation, regulations or initiatives, since many such programs and proposals are still in development.. Our operations would be adversely affected if service at our third-party terminals or on the common carrier pipelines used is interrupted.. The products that we sell are transported in either barge, pipeline or in truckload quantities to third-party terminals where we have contracts to temporarily store our products. Any significant interruption in the service of these third-party terminals or on the common carrier pipelines used would adversely affect our ability to obtain product.. The risk of global terrorism and political unrest may adversely affect the economy and the price and availability of the products that we sell and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Terrorist attacks and political unrest may adversely impact the price and availability of the products that we sell, our results of operations, our ability to raise capital and our future growth. The impact that the foregoing may have on our industry in general, and on our business in particular, is not known at this time. An act of terror could result in disruptions of crude oil supplies, markets and facilities, and the source of the products that we sell could be direct or indirect targets. Terrorist activity may also hinder our ability to transport our products if our normal means of transportation become damaged as a result of an attack. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism could also affect our ability to raise capital. Terrorist activity could likely lead to increased volatility in the prices of our products.. The impact of hurricanes and other natural disasters could cause disruptions in supply and could also reduce the demand for the products that we sell, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Hurricanes and other natural disasters may cause disruptions in the supply chains for the products that we sell. Disruptions in supply could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, causing an increase in wholesale prices and a decrease in supply. Hurricanes and other natural disasters could also cause disruptions in the power grid, which could prevent our customers from operating their home heating oil systems, thereby reducing our sales. For example, on October 29, 2012, storm Sandy made landfall in our service area, resulting in widespread power outages that affected a number of our customers. Deliveries of home heating oil and propane were less than expected for certain of our customers who were without power for several weeks subsequent to storm Sandy.. 19. Table of Contents. We depend on the use of information technology systems that could fail or be the target of cyber-attacks.. Our systems and networks are maintained internally and by third-party vendors, and their failure could significantly impede operations. In addition, our systems and networks, as well as those of our vendors, banks and counterparties, may receive and store personal/business information in connection with human resources operations, customer offerings, and other aspects of our business. A cyber-attack or material network breach in the security of these systems could include the theft of proprietary information or employee and customer information, as well as disrupt our operations or damage our facilities or those of third parties. This could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and increase our operating and capital costs, which could reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to the Company's data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential or customer or employee information, it could cause significant damage to the Company's reputation, affect relationships with its customers and employees, lead to claims against the Company, and ultimately harm our business. In addition, we may be required to incur additional costs to modify, remediate and protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, then we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential unitholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common units.. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. We may experience difficulties in implementing effective internal controls as part of our integration of acquisitions from private companies, which are not subject to the internal control requirements imposed on public companies. If we are unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or if the businesses we acquire have ineffective internal controls, our operating results could be harmed or we may fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls over financial reporting could cause our unitholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common units.. Conflicts of interest have arisen and could arise in the future.. Conflicts of interest have arisen and could arise in the future as a result of relationships between the general partner and its affiliates, on the one hand, and us or any of our limited partners, on the other hand. As a result of these conflicts the general partner may favor its own interests and those of its affiliates over the interests of the unitholders. The nature of these conflicts is ongoing and includes the following considerations:. <U+0095>   The general partner's affiliates are not prohibited from engaging in other business or activities, including direct competition with us.. <U+0095>   The general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, capital expenditures, borrowings and reserves, each of which can impact the amount of cash, if any, available for distribution to unitholders, and available to pay principal and interest on debt and the amount of incentive distributions payable in respect of the general partner units.. <U+0095>   The general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by the general partner.. <U+0095>   The general partner decides whether to retain its counsel or engage separate counsel to perform services for us.. <U+0095>   In some instances the general partner may borrow funds in order to permit the payment of distributions to unitholders.. <U+0095>   The general partner may limit its liability and reduce its fiduciary duties, while also restricting the remedies available to unitholders for actions that might, without limitations, constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.. <U+0095>   Unitholders are deemed to have consented to some actions and conflicts of interest that might otherwise be deemed a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law.. <U+0095>   The general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties in addition to the Company in resolving conflicts of interest, thereby limiting its fiduciary duty to the unitholders.. 20. Table of Contents. <U+0095>   The general partner determines whether to issue additional units or other of our securities.. <U+0095>   The general partner determines which costs are reimbursable by us.. <U+0095>   The general partner is not restricted from causing us to pay the general partner or its affiliates for any services rendered on terms that are fair and reasonable to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf.. We could experience significant increases in operating costs and reduced profitability due to competition for drivers and servicemen labor.. We compete with other entities for drivers and servicemen labor, including entities that operate in different market sectors than us. Costs to recruit and retain adequate personnel, the loss of certain personnel, our inability to attract and retain other qualified personnel or a labor shortage that reduces the pool of qualified candidates could adversely affect our results of operations.. A substantial portion of our workforce is unionized, and we may face labor actions that could disrupt our operations or lead to higher labor costs and adversely affect our business.. As of September 30, 2017, approximately 43% of our employees were covered under 61 different collective bargaining agreements. As a result, we are usually involved in union negotiations with several local bargaining units at any given time. There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate the terms of any expired or expiring agreement on terms satisfactory to us. Although we consider our relations with our employees to be generally satisfactory, we may experience strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns in the future. If our unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, our non-union employees may become subject to labor organizing efforts. If any of our current non-union facilities were to unionize, we could incur increased risk of work stoppages and potentially higher labor costs.. Cash distributions (if any) are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with performance and reserve requirements.. Distributions of available cash by us to unitholders will depend on the amount of cash generated, and distributions may fluctuate based on our performance. The actual amount of cash that is available will depend upon numerous factors, including:. <U+0095>   profitability of operations,. <U+0095>   required principal and interest payments on debt or debt prepayments,. <U+0095>   debt covenants,. <U+0095>   margin account requirements,. <U+0095>   cost of acquisitions,. <U+0095>   issuance of debt and equity securities,. <U+0095>   fluctuations in working capital,. <U+0095>   capital expenditures,. <U+0095>   units repurchased,. <U+0095>   adjustments in reserves,. <U+0095>   prevailing economic conditions,. <U+0095>   financial, business and other factors,. <U+0095>   increased pension funding requirements, and. <U+0095>   the amount of cash taxes we have to pay in Federal, State and local corporate income and franchise taxes.. 21. Table of Contents. Our credit agreement imposes restrictions on our ability to pay distributions to unitholders, including the need to maintain certain covenants. (See the third amended and restated credit agreement and Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Long-Term Debt and Bank Facility Borrowings). Our substantial debt and other financial obligations could impair our financial condition and our ability to obtain additional financing and have a material adverse effect on us if we fail to meet our financial and other obligations.. At September 30, 2017, we had outstanding under our credit agreement a $76.3 million term loan due July 2020. In addition, under the revolver portion of our credit agreement which expires in July 2020, we had no borrowings, but $48 million of letters of credit were issued, $0.1 million of hedge positions were secured, and availability was $166.1 million. Exclusive of the term loan, during the last three fiscal years we have utilized as much as $84.2 million of our credit agreement in borrowings, letters of credit and hedging reserve. Our substantial indebtedness and other financial obligations could:. <U+0095>   impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, unit repurchases or general partnership purposes;. <U+0095>   have a material adverse effect on us if we fail to comply with financial and affirmative and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements and an event of default occurs that is not cured or waived;. <U+0095>   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow for principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and other financial obligations, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital and capital expenditures;. <U+0095>   expose us to interest rate risk because certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;. <U+0095>   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and. <U+0095>   place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionally less debt.. If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations and other financial obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness and other financial transactions, seek additional equity capital or sell our assets. We might then be unable to obtain such financing or capital or sell our assets on satisfactory terms, if at all.. We are not required to accumulate cash for the purpose of meeting our future obligations to our lenders, which may limit the cash available to service the final payment due on the term loan outstanding under our credit agreement.. Subject to the limitations on restricted payments that are contained in our credit agreement, we are not required to accumulate cash for the purpose of meeting our future obligations to our lenders. As a result, we may be required to refinance the final payment of our term loan. Our ability to refinance the term loan will depend upon our future results of operation and financial condition as well as developments in the capital markets. Our general partner will determine the future use of our cash resources and has broad discretion in determining such uses and in establishing reserves for such uses, which may include but are not limited to:. <U+0095>   complying with the terms of any of our agreements or obligations;. <U+0095>   providing for distributions of cash to our unitholders in accordance with the requirements of our Partnership Agreement;. <U+0095>   providing for future capital expenditures and other payments deemed by our general partner to be necessary or advisable, including to make acquisitions; and. <U+0095>   repurchasing common units.. Depending on the timing and amount of our use of cash, this could significantly reduce the cash available to us in subsequent periods to make payments on borrowings under our credit agreement.. 22. Table of Contents. Restrictive covenants in our credit agreement may reduce our operating flexibility.. Our credit agreement contains various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:. <U+0095>   incur indebtedness;. <U+0095>   make distributions to our unitholders;. <U+0095>   purchase or redeem our outstanding equity interests or subordinated indebtedness;. <U+0095>   make investments;. <U+0095>   create liens;. <U+0095>   sell assets;. <U+0095>   engage in transactions with affiliates;. <U+0095>   restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments, loans, guarantees and transfers of assets or interests in assets;. <U+0095>   engage in sale-leaseback transactions;. <U+0095>   effect a merger or consolidation with or into other companies, a sale of all or substantially all of our properties or assets; and. <U+0095>   engage in other lines of business.. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financings, make capital expenditures, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. Our credit agreement also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial conditions. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and conditions can be affected by events beyond their control, such as weather conditions and general economic conditions. Accordingly, we may be unable to meet those ratios and conditions.. Any breach of any of these covenants, failure to meet any of these ratios or conditions, or occurrence of a change of control would result in a default under the terms of the relevant indebtedness or other financial obligations to become immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or liquidation proceeding or proceed against the collateral, if any. If the lenders of our indebtedness or other financial obligations accelerate the repayment of borrowings or other amounts owed, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness or other financial obligations, including the notes.. Under our credit agreement, the occurrence of a \"change of control\" is considered a default. We may be unable to repay borrowings under our credit agreement if the indebtedness outstanding thereunder is accelerated following a change of control.. We may be unable to satisfy our obligations under our credit agreement unless we are able to refinance or obtain waivers under our other indebtedness. We may not have the financial resources to repay borrowings under our credit agreement."
