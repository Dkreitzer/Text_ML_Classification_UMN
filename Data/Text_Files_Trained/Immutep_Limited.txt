[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Although we formally discontinued development of pafuramidine and have reduced our workforce, we may be unable to successfully manage our remaining resources, including available cash, while we seek to identify new drug development candidates or complete a strategic transaction.. We formally discontinued clinical development of pafuramidine in February 2008 after the pafuramidine program had been placed on clinical hold. We had previously devoted a majority of our research, development and clinical efforts and financial resources toward the development of pafuramidine, and we have few product candidates in clinical or preclinical development. In connection with the termination of our clinical development of pafuramidine, we had workforce reductions. We cannot predict whether we will be able to identify alternate strategic transactions which will either provide us with new drug development candidates or return value to our stockholders on a timely basis or at all. We also cannot predict whether any potential strategic transaction would be consummated on favorable terms, and anticipate that such transaction may require us to incur significant additional costs.. We have a history of losses and an accumulated deficit and, as a result, our future profitability is uncertain.. We have experienced significant operating losses since our inception and we expect to incur additional operating losses as we try to continue to develop pharmaceutical drug candidates, engage in clinical trials and commercialize products. As of March 31, 2009, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $118.5 million. Net losses attributable to common stockholders were approximately $11.0 million and $6.9 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009, respectively.. We have limited experience outside the drug and healthcare industry and our new investment in the Chinese tin industry and any other strategies or investments we pursue may not be successful and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the value of our common stock.. Following the discontinuance of clinical development of pafuramidine in February 2009, we have few product candidates in clinical or preclinical development. As a result, we have been pursuing other strategic investments both within the drug and healthcare industry and in unrelated industries for which we have no prior experience.. On January 22, 2009, we entered into an agreement with Gold Avenue, pursuant to which we invested $500,000 in Gold Avenue in exchange for approximately 11% of the Restricted-Voting Shares of Gold Avenue's capital stock. Our investment in Gold Avenue currently represents approximately 22% of our total assets as of March 31, 2009. On April 2, 2009, Gold Avenue purchased a $4,000,000 convertible bond issued by Parkwick and has the opportunity to purchase an additional $8,000,000 convertible bond issued by Parkwick. Parkwick is a private company incorporated in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong, which in turns holds a 66% interest in TJJV. TJJV's aim is to recover tin from large residual deposits, or tailings, from old mining sites in China. Our investment in Gold Avenue represents our first investment outside the drug and healthcare industry. We have no prior experience in the Chinese tin industry.. Our investment in Gold Avenue and any other strategic investments we may make are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. There are a limited number of investment opportunities available and we may not be able to successfully consummate profitable investments. In addition, identifying, consummating and monitoring these investments may place a significant strain on our management, financial, technical and other resources, resulting in disruption of our existing business and distraction of management. Our ability to identify, consummate and manage future investments will depend upon our ability to monitor operations, maintain effective quality, corporate governance and financial controls and expand our internal management and research personnel and technical and accounting systems. The integration of complementary businesses may also involve, among other things, implementation and integration of management, research expertise, financial reporting and control systems, some of which may be incompatible with our existing systems and therefore may need to be replaced. Our investment in Gold Avenue also poses additional risks due to our lack of prior experience in the Chinese tin industry, the international risks associated with the investment and the fact that we do not control Gold Avenue, Parkwick or TJJV. See \" - Risks Relating to Our Investment in Gold Avenue.\" Our investment in Gold Avenue and any other strategic investments we make may be unsuccessful and we could lose all of the value of these investments, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the value of our common stock.. -20-. Table of Contents. We need substantial additional funds, currently and in future years, to continue our research and development and to develop new business opportunities. If such financing is not available, we may be required to pursue other financing alternatives, reduce spending for our research programs or cease operations.. Our operations to date have consumed substantial amounts of cash. Negative cash flow from operations is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Without substantial additional financing, we may be required to reduce some or all of our research programs or cease operations. Our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of changes in our business strategy and the focus of our business, results of research and development, results of preclinical and clinical testing, responses to our grant requests, relationships with strategic partners, changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs, delays or failure in the enrollment and completion of our clinical trials, competitive and technological advances, FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes and other factors. In any of these circumstances, we may require substantially more funds than we currently have available or intend to raise to continue our business. We may seek to satisfy future funding requirements through public or private offerings of equity securities, by collaborative or other arrangements with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies or companies in other sectors, issuance of debt or from other sources. Additional financing may not be available when needed or may not be available on acceptable terms. If adequate financing is not available, we may not be able to continue as a going concern or may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate certain research and development programs, relinquish rights to certain technologies or drug candidates, forego desired opportunities or license third parties to commercialize our products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to pursue internally. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, ownership dilution to existing stockholders may result.. We receive funding primarily from research and development programs, fees associated with licensing of our technology, grants and from sales of equity securities. To date we have directed most of such funds not used for general and administrative overhead toward our research and development and commercialization programs (including preparation of submissions to regulatory agencies). Until one or more of our drug candidates is approved for sale or we pursue another business opportunity, our funding is limited to funds from research and development programs, fees associated with licensing of our technology, grants and proceeds from sales of equity or debt securities.. There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.. We currently have enough cash to operate into the third calendar quarter of 2009. We are currently considering financing alternatives. The decision to terminate our pafuramidine development program in February 2008 significantly depressed our stock price and severely impaired our ability to raise additional funds. We are continually evaluating our strategic alternatives with respect to all aspects of our business. We may be unable to realize value from our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business. We are currently listed on the Pink OTC Markets quotation system. All of these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.. -21-. Table of Contents. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we would have to liquidate our assets, and we might realize significantly less than the values at which they are carried on our financial statements. In addition, the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments or charges that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern, such as charges related to impairment of our assets, the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities or other similar adjustments. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm on the accompanying financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph regarding going-concern uncertainty.. There is no assurance that we will successfully develop a commercially viable product.. We are in various stages of preclinical development activities required for drug approval and commercialization. Since our formation in October 1984, we have engaged in research and development programs, expanding our network of scientists and scientific advisors, licensing technology agreements and, since obtaining the rights thereto in 1997, advancing the commercialization of the aromatic cation technology platform that we expect will be the basis for our drug candidates. We have generated no revenue from product sales, do not have any products currently available for sale, and none are expected to be commercially available for sale until after March 31, 2010, if at all. We cannot assure that the research we fund and manage will lead to commercially viable products.. The volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets and adverse changes in the global economy may negatively impact our business.. Due to the existing uncertainty in the capital and credit markets, our access to capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Further, if adverse national and global economic conditions persist or worsen, we could experience decreased shareholders' equity, and have difficulty executing our business plans.. The adverse capital and credit markets could affect our liquidity.. Adverse capital and credit market conditions could affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, as well as our access to capital and cost of capital. The capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption for more than twelve months. In recent weeks, the volatility and disruption have reached unprecedented levels and the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers. For example, recently credit spreads have widened considerably. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and capital position could be materially adversely affected by continued disruptions in the capital and credit markets.. -22-. Table of Contents. We may not be successful in retaining key employees and in attracting qualified new employees as required in the future. If we are unable to retain our management, scientific staff and scientific advisors or to attract additional qualified personnel, our ability to operate our business will be seriously jeopardized.. Competition among biotechnology companies for qualified employees is intense, and the ability to retain and attract qualified individuals is critical to our success. We may experience further reductions in our workforce due to voluntary employee resignations and a diminished ability to recruit new employees. We may be unable to attract or retain key personnel on acceptable terms, if at all.. All of our employees are \"at will\" and may leave at any time. None of our executive officers has as of this date, expressed any intention to retire or leave our employ. We do not have \"key-man\" life insurance policies on any of our executives.. Most of the financial aspects of our business, including investor relations, intellectual property control and corporate governance, are under the supervision of Eric L. Sorkin, Cecilia Chan and Gary Parks. Together, Mr. Sorkin, Ms. Chan and Mr. Parks hold institutional knowledge and business acumen that they utilize to assist us to forge new relationships and foster new business opportunities without diminishing or undermining existing programs and obligations.. A substantial portion of our proprietary intellectual property is developed by scientists who are not employed by us.. Our current business depends to a significant degree on the continuing contributions of our key management, scientific and technical personnel, as well as on the continued discoveries of scientists, researchers and specialists at UNC-CH, Georgia State University, Duke University, Auburn University, and Tulane University and other research groups that form part of our Scientific Consortium and assist in the development of our drug candidates. A substantial portion of our proprietary intellectual property is developed by scientists who are employed by our partner universities and other research groups. We do not have control over, knowledge of, or access to those employment arrangements. We have not been advised by any of our key employees, key members of the scientific research groups or other research groups that form part of our Scientific Consortium of their intention to leave their employ with these parties or the programs they conduct.. There can be no assurance that the loss of certain members of our management or the scientists, researchers and technicians from the universities or other members of our Scientific Consortium would not materially adversely affect our business.. None of our drug candidates have been approved for sale by any regulatory agency. Such approval is required before we can sell drug products commercially.. There can be no assurance that any of our drug candidates will be successfully developed, demonstrated to be safe and effective in human clinical trials, meet applicable regulatory standards, be approved by regulatory authorities, be eligible for third-party reimbursement from governmental or private insurers, be successfully marketed or achieve market acceptance. If we are unable to commercialize our drug candidates in a timely manner we may be required to seek additional funding, reduce or cancel some or all of our development programs, sell or license some of our proprietary information or cease operations.. -23-. Table of Contents. Delays in successfully completing any clinical trials we may conduct could jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval or market our potential product candidates on a timely basis.. As we develop potential product candidates, our business prospects may depend on our ability to complete patient enrollment in clinical trials, to obtain satisfactory results, to obtain required regulatory approvals and to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Product development, undertaken to show adequate evidence of effectiveness in animal models and safety and efficacy in humans, is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and delay or failure can occur at any stage of our non-clinical studies or clinical trials. Any delay or significant adverse clinical events arising during any of our clinical trials could force us to abandon a product candidate altogether or to conduct additional clinical trials in order to obtain approval from the FDA or other regulatory body. These development efforts and clinical trials are lengthy and expensive, and the outcome is uncertain. Completion of any clinical trials we may commence, announcement of results of the trials and our ability to obtain regulatory approvals could be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:. <U+0095>           slower-than-anticipated enrollment of volunteers in the trials;. <U+0095>           lower-than-anticipated recruitment or retention rate of volunteers in the trials;. <U+0095>           serious adverse events related to the product candidates;. <U+0095>           unsatisfactory results of any clinical trial;. <U+0095>           the failure of our principal third-party investigators to perform our clinical trials on our anticipated schedules; or. <U+0095>           different interpretations of our preclinical and clinical data, which could initially lead to inconclusive results.. Our development costs will increase if we have material delays in any clinical trial or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned. If the delays are significant, or if any of our product candidates do not prove to be safe or effective or do not receive required regulatory approvals, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates will be harmed. Furthermore, our inability to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner could jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval.. We do not currently have pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution capability, which could impair our ability to develop commercially viable products at reasonable costs.. Our ability to commercialize drug candidates will depend in part upon our ability to have manufactured or developed the capability to manufacture our drug candidates and to distribute those goods, either directly or through third parties, at a competitive cost and in accordance with FDA and other regulatory requirements. We currently lack facilities and personnel to manufacture or distribute our drug candidates. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire such resources, either directly or through third parties, at reasonable costs, if we develop commercially viable products.. -24-. Table of Contents. We are dependent on third party relationships for critical aspects of our business. Problems that develop in these relationships may increase costs and/or diminish our ability to develop our drug candidates.. We use the expertise and resources of strategic partners and third parties in a number of key areas, including (i) discovery research, (ii) preclinical and human clinical trials, (iii) product development, (iv) manufacturing of pharmaceutical drugs, and (v) distribution. We have a worldwide license and exclusive commercialization rights to a proprietary aromatic cation technology platform and are developing drugs intended for commercial use based on that platform. This strategy creates risks by placing critical aspects of our business in the hands of third parties, whom we may not be able to control. If these third parties do not perform in a timely and satisfactory manner, we may incur costs and delays as we seek alternate sources of such products and services, if available. Such costs and delays may have a material adverse effect on our business if the delays jeopardize our licensing arrangements by causing us to become non-compliant with certain license agreements.. We may seek additional third party relationships in certain areas, particularly in clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and other areas where pharmaceutical and biotechnology company collaborators will enable us to develop particular products or geographic markets that are otherwise beyond our current resources and/or capabilities. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such collaboration or any other research and development, clinical trial, manufacturing, marketing or distribution relationships. Our inability to obtain and maintain satisfactory relationships with third parties may have a material adverse effect on our business by slowing our ability to develop new products, requiring us to expand our internal capabilities, increasing our overhead and expenses, hampering future growth opportunities or causing us to delay or terminate affected programs.. We are uncertain about our ability to protect or obtain necessary patents and protect our proprietary information. Our ability to develop and commercialize drug candidates would be compromised without adequate intellectual property protection.. We have spent and continue to spend considerable funds to develop our drug candidates and we are relying on the potential to exploit commercially without competition the results of our product development. Much of our intellectual property is licensed to us under various agreements, including the Consortium Agreement, the Amended and Restated License Agreement, and a license agreement with Tulane University. It is the primary responsibility of the discoverer to develop his, her or its invention confidentially, insure that the invention is unique, and to obtain patent protection. In most cases, our role is to reimburse patent related costs after we decide to develop any such invention. We therefore rely on the inventors to insure that technology licensed to us is adequately protected. Without adequate protection for our intellectual property we believe our ability to realize profits on our future commercialized product would be diminished. Without protection, competitors might be able to copy our work and compete with our products without having invested in the development.. -25-. Table of Contents. There can be no assurance that any particular patent will be granted or that issued patents (issued to us directly or through licenses) will provide us with the intellectual property protection contemplated by such patents. Patents and licenses of patents can be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Patent litigation is expensive and time-consuming and the outcome cannot be predicted. It is also possible that competitors will develop similar products simultaneously. Our breach of any license agreement or the failure to obtain a license to any technology or process which may be required to develop or commercialize one or more of our drug candidates may have a material adverse effect on our business, including the need for additional capital to develop alternate technology, the potential that competitors may gain unfair advantage and lessen our expectation of potential future revenues.. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields are characterized by a large number of patent filings, and a substantial number of patents have already been issued to other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Third parties may have filed applications for, or may have been issued, certain patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights related to products or processes competitive with or similar to those that we are attempting to develop and commercialize. We may not be aware of all of the patents potentially adverse to our interests that may have been issued to others. No assurance can be given that patents do not exist, have not been filed or could not be filed or issued, which contain claims relating to or competitive with our technology, drug candidates, product uses or processes. If patents have been or are issued to others containing preclusive or conflicting claims, then we may be required to obtain licenses to one or more of such patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology. There can be no assurance that the licenses or alternative technology that might be required for such alternative processes or products would be available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.. Because of the substantial length of time and expense associated with bringing new drug products to market through the development and regulatory approval process, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries place considerable importance on patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products and processes. Since patent applications filed in the United States are confidential for eighteen months after filing and some are confidential until their date of issue as a patent and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we (or our licensors) were the first to make the inventions covered by pending patent applications or that we (or our licensors) were the first to file patent applications for such inventions. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical and biotechnology patents, or their enforceability, cannot be predicted. There can be no assurance that any patents under pending patent applications or any further patent applications will be issued. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the scope of any patent protection will exclude competitors or provide us competitive advantages, that any of our (or our licensors') patents that have been issued or may be issued will be held valid if subsequently challenged, or that others, including competitors or current or former employers of our employees, advisors and consultants, will not claim rights in, or ownership to, our (or our licensors') patents and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or otherwise obtain access to our proprietary information, or that others may not be issued patents that may require us to obtain a license for, and pay significant fees or royalties for, such proprietary information.. -26-. Table of Contents. We rely on technology developed by others and shared with collaborators to develop our drug candidates, which puts our proprietary information at risk of unauthorized disclosure.. We rely on trade secrets, know-how and technological advancement to maintain our competitive position. Although we use license agreements, confidentiality agreements and employee proprietary information and invention assignment agreements to protect our trade secrets and other unpatented know-how, these agreements may be breached by the other party thereto or may otherwise be of limited effectiveness or enforceability.. We are licensed to commercialize technology from a proprietary aromatic cation technology platform developed by our research partners, comprised primarily of scientists employed by universities in our Scientific Consortium. The academic world is improved by the sharing of information. As a business, however, the sharing of information whether through publication of research, academic lectures or general intellectual discourse among contemporaries is not conducive to protection of proprietary information. Our proprietary information may fall into the possession of unintended parties without our knowledge through customary academic information sharing.. At times we may enter into confidentiality agreements with other companies, allowing them to test our technology for potential future licensing, in return for milestone and royalty payments should any discoveries result from the use of our proprietary information. We cannot be assured that such parties will honor these confidentiality agreements subjecting our intellectual property to unintended disclosure.. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have experienced extensive litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We could incur substantial costs in defending suits that may be brought against us (or our licensors) claiming infringement of the rights of others or in asserting our (or our licensors') patent rights in a suit against another party. We may also be required to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office or similar foreign agency for the purpose of determining the priority of inventions in connection with our (or our licensors') patent applications.. Adverse determinations in litigation or interference proceedings could require us to seek licenses (which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms) or subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business by increasing our expenses. Even if we prevail in an interference proceeding or a lawsuit, substantial resources, including the time and attention of our officers, would be required.. -27-. Table of Contents. Confidentiality agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property, which could result in unauthorized disclosure or use of our proprietary information.. We require our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we share proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationship with us. The agreements generally provide that trade secrets and all inventions conceived by the individual and all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the term of the relationship will be our exclusive property and will be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. If our unpatented proprietary information is publicly disclosed before we have been granted patent protection, our competitors could be unjustly enriched and we could lose the ability to profitably develop products from such information.. The pharmaceutical industry has significant competition and our drug candidates may become obsolete prior to commercialization due to alternative technologies, thereby rendering our development efforts obsolete or non-competitive.. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields are characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. Competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research and academic institutions is intense and other companies are engaged in research and product development to treat the same diseases that we target. New developments in pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields are expected to continue at a rapid pace in both industry and academia. There can be no assurance that research and discoveries by others will not render some or all of our programs or products non-competitive or obsolete.. We are aware of other companies and institutions dedicated to the development of therapeutics similar to those we are developing. Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources than we do and therefore may be in a better position to develop, manufacture and market pharmaceutical products. Many of these competitors are also more experienced performing preclinical testing and human clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals. The current or future existence of competitive products may also adversely affect the marketability of our drug candidates.. In the event some or all of our programs are rendered non-competitive or obsolete, we do not currently have alternative strategies to develop new product lines or the financial resources to pursue such a course of action.. -28-. Table of Contents. RISKS RELATING TO OUR INVESTMENT IN GOLD AVENUE. TJJV's results of operations will be dependent on the market price for tin, which is driven by supply and demand factors, and we may also be exposed to fluctuations in the prices of other metals such as copper and zinc in the future.. TJJV's results of operations will be sensitive to fluctuation in the market prices for tin as it expects to derive most of its revenues from the sale of tin powder. Tin prices have increased recently in the face of limited supply and increased global demand. In China, where TJJV expects to conduct almost all of its operations, the tin price is not only affected by domestic supply and demand but also highly influenced by the international market price as denominated in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in both international and domestic tin prices are beyond Gold Avenue's or TJJV's control. Factors that affect tin prices include forward selling activities, global mine production, world tin recovery and recycling systems as well as other macro-economic factors such as expectations regarding inflation, interest rates, currency exchange rates and general global economic conditions. A significant reduction in tin prices for a prolonged period could lead to a material deterioration in Gold Avenue's financial performance and a material write-down of its investment in mining properties and as a result, materially and adversely affect our and Gold Avenue's business, financial condition and results of operations.. Although in recent years demand for tin has risen steadily, there can be no assurance that the Chinese domestic or global demand for tin and tin-related products will continue to grow, or that the Chinese or global tin markets will not experience excess supply. A significant decline in demand for, or an excess supply of, tin could cause the average selling prices or sales volumes of TJJV's tin powder to decrease and therefore have a material adverse effect on our and Gold Avenue's business, financial condition and results of operations.. TJJV also expects to seek to extract other metals such as copper, iron, and zinc which are contained in tin deposits. As such, we expect that Gold Avenue's business will also become sensitive to and exposed to fluctuations in market prices for these other metals in the future.. The tin recovery rate as well as TJJV's potential yields of tin production from tailings at the 17 mining sites are estimates, and TJJV may produce less tin than our current estimates. TJJV's annual gross sales, projected future production volumes and capital expenditures, which are based on these estimates, may therefore be materially affected.. The estimates of tin recovery rate and the amount of tin that can be recovered are opinions of the management of Gold Avenue based on their knowledge, experience as well as on assays and results from pilot plants provided by YTG. The recovery rate and estimates on the amount of tin that can be recovered from the tailings depend to some extent on interpretations and deductions that may be based on inaccurate assumptions. They involve expressions of judgment with regard to the presence and grade of mineralization and the ability to extract and process the mineralization economically. These judgments are based on a variety of factors, such as knowledge, experience and industry practice. Our estimates of the amount of tin that can be recovered are subject to change, in particular when new information or improved measuring techniques become available. The accuracy of these estimates can be affected by many factors, including the quality of the procedures adopted and the experience of those making the estimates. As further information becomes available, the estimates are likely to change. This could result in alterations to Gold Avenue's operation and development plans that could, in turn, materially and adversely affect Gold Avenue's and our business, financial condition and results of operations.. The projected yields of tin powder from tailings of the 17 mining sites are also estimates and as such are subject to change or could be inaccurate. Therefore TJJV's projected future production volumes, turnover and capital expenditures, which are based on these estimates, could differ materially. These production, turnover and expenditure plans are based on the estimated realization of yield (the amount of tin processed per ton of earth) and the effectiveness of technology used for separating tin powder from the residual tin mine tailings. There are many factors, assumptions and variables beyond TJJV's, Gold Avenue's and our control that result in inherent uncertainties in estimating yields and so TJJV's actual volume of yields and rates of production can be different from these estimates. If such a revision results in a substantial reduction in expected recoverable reserves at a number of TJJV's 17 mines, it could materially and adversely affect Gold Avenue's and our business, financial condition and results of operations.. -29-. Table of Contents. We and Gold Avenue face risks associated with being reliant on the representations of Parkwick and YTG as to the ownership of the 17 mine sites and the tailings from those sites as well as on the representations of Parkwick on the financial status of Parkwick and the TJJV, both of which have not been verified. Any inaccuracy of such representations could materially and adversely affect our and Gold Avenue's result of operations.. TJJV's rights to the tin tailings at the 17 mining sites are based on the rights and title that YTG has over the 17 mining sites to deal with the tailings of the 17 tin sites. According to the representations given by Parkwick and YTG, YTG has full mining rights over the 17 tin sites and thus the rights to the tailings and has the ability to transfer ownership of such tailings to TJJV. However, no due diligence on the ownership of the 17 mining sites, and thus the ownership of the tailings, has been conducted by Gold Avenue.. If any representation as to the ownership of the 17 tin sites and tailings is not completely accurate, this could materially and adversely affect Gold Avenue's and our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Gold Avenue management has reviewed copies of unaudited financial statements and accounts of Parkwick provided by Parkwick. Gold Avenue relies on the representations given by Parkwick that such accounts and records were complete and true. Due to the recent incorporation of TJJV on January 23, 2008, no other financial due diligence has been conducted. If any representation as to the completeness and truthfulness of such accounts is not completely accurate, it could materially and adversely affect Gold Avenue's and our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We do not own a majority of the ordinary shares of Gold Avenue and our Restricted-Voting Shares have limited voting rights and we do not own or control Parkwick and they could take actions in a manner that is in their interests, but not in our interests.. As of March 31, 2009, we owned approximately 11% of the Restricted-Voting Shares of Gold Avenue's capital stock. The remaining Restricted-Voting Shares of Gold Avenue, which together with our Restricted-Voting Shares represent approximately 80% of Gold Avenue's outstanding capital stock, are held by other outside investors. In addition, Mr. Sorkin, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors, and Ms. Chan, our Vice Chairman and a member of our board of directors, collectively have agreed to hold 20% of the remaining outstanding ordinary shares of Gold Avenue, all of which are voting shares, as our nominees. Our Restricted-Voting Shares are entitled to vote only in certain limited events relating to the creation of new shares, increases or reductions in the authorized capital of the Restricted-Voting Shares, amendments to charter documents, mergers, consolidations, reorganizations and liquidations, sales of Gold Avenue, and engaging in certain businesses. Because we do not own a majority of Gold Avenue's capital stock and our Restricted-Voting Shares have limited voting rights, we do not control Gold Avenue and are limited in our ability to influence its management and business. Mr. Sorkin, Ms. Chan and Mr. Sinex may have interests that are different than and in conflict to ours and could vote their voting shares in a manner that is in their interests and not in our interests. In addition, even in the limited instances where we are entitled to vote our Restricted-Voting Shares, the other investors, together with Mr. Sorkin, Ms. Chan and Mr. Sinex, could vote their shares in a manner that is not in our interests and we would not be able to control the outcome of any such vote. In addition, because Gold Avenue has invested only in a convertible note issued by Parkwick, it does not own any ordinary shares of Parkwick and has no current rights as a shareholder of Parkwick. As a result, Gold Avenue is unable to influence Parkwick's strategies, management and business and is limited in its ability to monitor Parkwick's business and financial condition.. -30-. Table of Contents. We and Gold Avenue face risks associated with being reliant on YTG as the operating partner, whose interests may differ from ours and Gold Avenue's.. YTG is the largest tin mining company in the world and operates the largest tin refinery in the world. Our and Gold Avenue's investment strategy is to cooperate with YTG and rely on its experience and know-how as a Chinese tin mining company to operate the 17 recovery sites. There can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful nor that YTG will remain a complementary business partner in TJJV or that we, Gold Avenue or Parkwick will be able to negotiate favorable business development terms with YTG. In addition, TJJV and YTG need to work out the terms and conditions as to how tailings should be provided to TJJV for processing, including, without limitation, to logistics of the provision, which party should bear the costs of resources tax and value-added tax (\"VAT\"). It is customary practice in China for the purchaser to assume the VAT costs.. As a result of its investment in Parkwick, Gold Avenue is entitled to appoint one of Parkwick's three directors to the five member board of directors of TJJV and YTG has the right to appoint two directors to the board of directors in TJJV. The board of directors of TJJV is the highest governing body of TJJV, which determines all the important matters of TJJV. Except for certain matters which require the unanimous approval of the board, all other matters must be approved by at least four out of the five board members. Despite Parkwick holding a majority of the board of directors of TJJV, since YTG has the right to appoint two directors to the board of directors of TJJV, YTG has a veto right on all matters related to TJJV. YTG, through its voting power at shareholders' meetings and board meetings of TJJV, has a significant influence over the management and corporate policies of TJJV, including its corporate transactions, development strategies, capital expenditure and distribution plans which may cause TJJV to act in a manner contrary to Gold Avenue's and/or our best interests. There is no assurance that YTG will vote on shareholders' or board resolutions in a way that will benefit us, Gold Avenue or Parkwick, and this may in turn affect the operational results of TJJV and its distributable dividend which could materially and adversely affect Gold Avenue's and our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Any regulatory change or unforeseeable circumstances that require the TJJV to obtain permits/licenses for TJJV's tin operations in the future could materially and adversely affect Gold Avenue's and our results of operations.. Under the \"Mineral Resources Law\" of China, all mineral resources of China are owned by the Chinese State. According to the newly promulgated Chinese Foreign Investment Catalogue, which became effective on December 1, 2007, the exploring and mining of tin falls within the prohibited category, and tin recovery business from tin tailings falls within the permitted category. Mining enterprises must obtain mining rights prior to undertaking any mining activities in a specific mining area during the license period. Typically, the duration for which mining rights are granted cannot exceed the projected number of years of service of a mine, and the consideration for such mining rights is appraised on the basis of such service period. Mining enterprise should also obtain a valid safety production license under \"PRC Regulations on Production Safety License\" before engaging in production activities.. TJJV is engaging in the tin recovery business based on YTG granting to TJJV permission to process its tin tailings from 17 sites. Gold Avenue has been advised by its Chinese legal adviser that so long as the processing of tin tailing requires no mining or exploitation of tin is involved, no exploration or mining license or permit is required for TJJV. However, we cannot assure you that the Chinese regulatory authority would not otherwise interpret Gold Avenue's processing procedures to require exploration or mining licenses or permits.. -31-. Table of Contents. Upon the expiration of the joint venture term of TJJV in January 2018, there can be no assurance that TJJV and YTG will be able to extend or renew the term of the joint venture arrangement of TJJV. In addition, any regulatory changes or other unforeseen circumstances could prevent TJJV from operating without being required to obtain any specific license/permit, which could result in TJJV being ordered to cease operations at the relevant sites(s). The occurrence of any of the aforementioned events could materially and adversely affect our and Gold Avenue's business, financial condition and results of operations. Increasing regulation of the Chinese tin industry by the Chinese government could also have an adverse effect on TJJV's operational activities.. We and Gold Avenue face risks associated with reliance on YTG's obligation to purchase TJJV's products.. All of TJJV's production of tin powder from the 17 mining sites will be purchased by YTG if they are up to qualified standard. Developing and expanding customer relationship with YTG is vital to TJJV's business. Given that TJJV's turnover will rely on YTG's willingness to purchase TJJV's tin production, if there is an adverse development in the business of YTG or TJJV's relationship with YTG, or a reduction or cessation of orders from YTG, TJJV may not be able to obtain, in substitution, suitable orders of a comparable size from other customers which could materially and adversely affect Gold Avenue's and our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, TJJV and YTG may further define the standard of products qualification. Otherwise, TJJV must meet the customary standards that are applicable to its products.. The tin purchase arrangement with YTG also involves a number of risks that could affect the relationship between YTG and TJJV, including:. <U+0095>           although YTG undertakes to purchase any qualified products from TJJV, how to determine whether TJJV's products are qualified products is not certain;. <U+0095>           although TJJV intends to adopt the London Metals Exchange market price as the benchmark for the market price, it is not known whether this is acceptable to YTG despite it being globally customary to do so;. <U+0095>           disputes with YTG in relation to the performance of each party's obligations under the agreement;. <U+0095>           disputes with YTG as to the scope of responsibilities under the arrangement; and. <U+0095>           financial difficulties encountered by YTG affecting its ability to purchase qualified products from TJJV.. Such issues could lead to disputes with YTG and cause disruptions in the operations of TJJV which could materially and adversely affect Gold Avenue's and our business, financial condition and results of operations.. -32-. Table of Contents. Gold Avenue faces risks associated with reliance on individual directors and management.. Operating a company that needs to process tailings from 17 mining sites could consume a considerable amount of management time and result in operating difficulties and expenditures. The business performance of TJJV will be particularly dependent upon the efforts, experience, social contacts, skills and continued service of its directors and the directors of Parkwick and Gold Avenue. The loss of service of any such individual could have a material, adverse effect on TJJV, occur at any time due to death, disability, resignation or other reasons. However, despite the reliance upon such individual directors, Gold Avenue will, to some extent, have control over the general management of Parkwick. So long as Gold Avenue holds any shares or the convertible bond in Parkwick, it will have veto rights in regards to important matters of Parkwick. Additional directors could also be appointed to the board of Parkwick and Gold Avenue will have no power to prevent any such appointment. Gold Avenue's directors lack substantial prior experience managing an entity such as Gold Avenue.. TJJV may find it difficult attracting and retaining management and technical personnel.. If TJJV is unable to attract or retain managerial and technical personnel, its business and operations may be adversely affected. Attracting and retaining scarce top quality managerial talent has become a serious challenge for companies in China. In particular, TJJV depends on specific key talent such as geologists and exploration and production specialists. Consequently, TJJV must compete with its business rivals to attract experienced personnel who may be able to pay higher salaries and provide better benefits. TJJV's failure to acquire or retain quality personnel in key positions could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. TJJV faces risks associated with reliance on local labor.. Tin recovery work is labor-intensive. TJJV will rely on local labor for its tin recovery operations. TJJV's operations will be affected by the performance, training, and physical condition of its employees. Failure to maintain a cooperative relationship with employees or to comply with employment regulations such as minimum wage requirement could affect TJJV's ability to meet its labor needs and hire qualified staff, and could affect its operations and thus adversely affect Gold Avenue's and our business results.. TJJV's operating business is in Gejiu, Yunnan, a place known as \"the capital of tin\" with the highest tin production capacity in China. Employees in tin processing can be subject to higher than normal arsenic and radon exposures. In addition, in the first half of 2003, certain Asian countries, including China, encountered an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and in recent years, several Asian countries, including China, have reported occurrences of avian influenza. It is not predictable whether health problems of employees or other diseases may cause shortage or loss of labor. Such situations, if they become serious, may cause material disruptions to TJJV's operations, which could materially and adversely affect Gold Avenue's and our business, financial condition and results of operations.. TJJV may not complete its existing and future major capital expenditure projects within its budget and expected time frame, or at all, and may not generate the intended economic results.. TJJV has commenced recover operations at one of the 17 sites and has operated pilot operations at two other sites. All operations have been stopped due to the impending investment in the tailings via Parkwick. The cost of production at a site includes not just the actual cost of a production line but also the infrastructural cost of installing it. Different lines in different locations require different infrastructural investments. Gold Avenue's investment is being used to operate only the existing operational site and will be used to expand the two sites that have operated as pilots, with new production lines and supporting infrastructure, and to build one new production site. There can be no assurance that TJJV will be successfully in generating sufficient returns from its investment by Gold Avenue.. The processing of mineral resources and liquidity in that business require substantial capital investments and adequate cash inflows. TJJV's production or operation costs could exceed its original budget as a result of various factors including, but not limited to, its ability to obtain Chinese government approvals, failure to hire adequate staff, construction difficulties, technical difficulties and manpower or other resource constraints. Even if TJJV is able to complete its business plan without any delay and within budget, as a consequence of changes in market circumstances or other factors, it may not achieve the intended economic benefits. It may also require short-term and long-term bank loans in the future to implement its operational strategy or maintain cash flow.. -33-. Table of Contents. TJJV may in the future invest in projects at its existing operations to increase tin production efficiency and capacity, but failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals from the Chinese government or sufficient funding, the negative conditions in the global and domestic financial markets, cost overruns, failure to obtain bank loans and changes in the monetary policy of the Chinese government with respect to bank interest rates or other factors may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, future capital raised through issuance of shares or other securities may result in a substantial dilution of the interests of TJJV's shareholders.. Gold Avenue is reliant on TJJV paying distributions to Parkwick in order for Parkwick to pay interest or dividends to Gold Avenue. The joint venture, TJJV, is subject to restrictions on paying dividends to Parkwick. Unless and until Gold Avenue converts its convertible bond issued by Parkwick, it is not entitled to any dividends from Parkwick.. Gold Avenue's main business is in China which is carried out by TJJV, the operating joint venture. According to the joint venture agreement, TJJV will distribute dividends once a year to its shareholders, Parkwick and YTG, to the extent available. After receiving Gold Avenue's percentage share of the dividends distributed from Parkwick, Gold Avenue intends to redistribute the dividends to its shareholders, with holders of Restricted-Voting Shares receiving 80 percent of dividends pro rata to their holdings of the Restricted-Voting Shares. However, Gold Avenue will not be entitled to receive any dividend distributed by TJJV in turn until and unless it exercises its conversion rights attached to the convertible bond issued by Parkwick which carries an interest rate of 22% per annum that is due and payable semi-annually on June 30th and December 31st. Even if any conversion right is exercised, it is anticipated that there will be no dividends in 2009 due to reinvestment plans. After receiving the interest derived from the convertible bond, Gold Avenue intends to distribute 80 percent of such interest pro rata to holders of Restricted-Voting Shares according to their respective shareholding and 20% of the same to management who hold the Management Shares.. Gold Avenue relies principally on interest paid by Parkwick, and dividends and/or other distributions on equity paid by TJJV. Parkwick has no independent operations of its own and is dependent on distributions from TJJV to pay interest and dividends to Gold Avenue. If the earnings from TJJV decline, dividends to be distributed may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, there may be no dividend at all in the future to its shareholders if there are no accumulated net profits in TJJV. The dividends from TJJV are subject to the following restrictions:. <U+0095>           If TJJV, Parkwick or Gold Avenue incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions.. <U+0095>           Parkwick's ability to pay dividends will depend on the ability of TJJV to generate distributable net (after-tax) profits. TJJV will pay dividends only out of its accumulated net profits (so long as such profits have not been previously utilized through a distribution or capitalization) after deduction of accumulated realized losses (so long as such losses have not been previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital) and allocations to statutory funds as required by Chinese law.. <U+0095>           TJJV is required under Chinese laws and regulations to allocate its profits after tax as reported in its Chinese statutory financial statements to the reserve fund, enterprise development fund, and staff bonus and welfare fund; the proportion of the allocation shall be decided by the board of directors of TJJV in accordance with all applicable Chinese laws and regulations. These funds are not available for distribution to its shareholders, except in liquidation, and may not be transferred in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends.. Consequently, Gold Avenue may not receive any dividends, which are dependent on TJJV's and Parkwick's future results of operations, debt levels, capital requirements, general financial condition, and legal and contractual restrictions.. -34-. Table of Contents. TJJV's business may be adversely affected by shortages in electricity and water supply or increases in electricity and water prices.. TJJV will consume a substantial amount of electricity and water in connection with its tin recovery operations. It is expected that TJJV's demand for electricity and water will increase as its production capabilities increase and its business grows. Any shortages or disruption in electricity or water supply could lead to lengthy production shutdowns and increased costs related to recommencement of operations. Insufficient electricity or water supply, or any power or water blackout for a significant period of time may force TJJV to limit or delay production, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. Any significant increase in electricity and water prices will increase TJJV's production costs and may adversely affect its results of operations if it is not able to pass the increased costs on to its customers, which could materially and adversely affect our and Gold Avenue's business, financial condition and results of operations.. TJJV's business operations may incur increased or new costs or could be adversely affected by present or future safety and environmental laws and regulations.. TJJV's operations are subject to increasingly stringent laws, rules and regulations imposed by the Chinese government regarding environmental matters (including the treatment and discharge of hazardous wastes and materials) and public health and safety. TJJV must undergo inspections by the relevant Chinese environmental authorities, at their discretion, from time to time. One of the main environmental issues in the tin mining industry is waste water management.. The development of the Chinese economy, and the improvements in the living standards of the population, may lead to an increase in awareness of preserving the natural environment.. In response to this possible increase in awareness, the national, provincial and the municipal governments may promulgate new laws and regulations which may require TJJV to improve its facilities for environmental protection purposes, such as reducing pollutant discharge limits, installing pollution control equipment, increasing pollutant discharge fees, imposing more extensive pollution control requirements or increasing the number of regulated substances. In such event, TJJV may incur costs to comply with such laws and regulations, resulting in higher operating costs for TJJV.. There can be no assurance that TJJV will be able to comply with all environmental laws and regulations that are adopted or amended in the future. Failure to comply with or any change or difference in the interpretation or enforcement policy of such laws and regulations, or the occurrence of any unanticipated environmental effects from TJJV's operations could subject it to punitive governmental measures. There can be no assurance that compliance with environmental laws or regulations adopted or amended in the future or measures to be taken to tackle unanticipated environmental effects from TJJV's operations will not materially increase TJJV's operating and other expenses, which could materially and adversely affect our and Gold Avenue's business, financial condition and results of operations.. TJJV may suffer losses from property damage, environmental damage claims and personal injuries sustained from industry-related accidents and its insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover the risks related to its business.. TJJV's operations may be affected by accidents, technical difficulties, mechanical failure, plant breakdown or any industry-related accidents encountered in the tin recovery process. Such technical difficulties, mechanical failure, plant breakdown or any industry-related accidents could happen in the future and could result in disruptions to its operations, or even mandatory suspension of operations, increases in operating costs, financial losses, fines, corrective measures or penalties imposed by the regulatory authorities, personal injuries claims or other compensatory claims, and/or damage to reputation.. -35-. Table of Contents. TJJV plans to maintain insurance coverage on certain fixed assets including transportation vehicles. In respect of its tin recovery work, TJJV does not currently maintain fire, liability or other property insurance covering its properties, equipment or inventories, save for the limited insurance coverage. As is customary in China, TJJV does not maintain insurance for losses caused by business disruptions due to the discontinuation of service of its key management. In addition, neither TJJV, Parkwick nor Gold Avenue maintain any business interruption insurance or any third party liability insurance to cover claims in respect of personal injury or property or environmental damage arising from accidents on their properties, other than third party liability insurance with respect to vehicles. Any uninsured losses and liabilities incurred by TJJV may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. There is no assurance that it will be able to obtain insurance coverage that is consistent with industry practice at reasonable rates, or that such coverage is adequate to cover any economic loss which TJJV may suffer, or claims which may be brought against it. If TJJV's insurance coverage is to be deemed insufficient then this would have an adverse impact on its business, which could materially and adversely affect our and Gold Avenue's business, financial condition and results of operations.. Natural disasters, health epidemics, strikes, terrorist attacks, wars and other unforeseen events beyond Gold Avenue's control as well as operational risks may disrupt TJJV's business and adversely affect its operational results.. TJJV's tin recovery operations are subject to a number of operating risks and hazards, some of which are beyond its control, which could delay the production and delivery of tin powder or increase the cost of operation. These include unexpected maintenance or technical problems, strikes, terrorist attacks, human disease, earthquakes, periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions and natural disasters, industrial accidents, power or fuel supply interruptions, critical equipment failure in the recycling work, fires, earthquakes, flooding and unusual or unexpected variations in mineralization, geological or mining conditions. Such risks could affect TJJV's tin powder production as well as any possible expansion of tin mining business, which could materially and adversely affect Gold Avenue's and our business, financial condition and results of operations.. TJJV faces competition from domestic and foreign competitors.. TJJV faces competition from both domestic and international tin producers. Competition in the tin recovery industry is based on many factors, including tin resources and reserves, tin powder quality and characteristics, transportation capability, costs and technology. Some of TJJV's competitors may have certain advantages over it, including greater financial, technical and raw material resources, greater economics of scale, broader name recognition and more established relationships in certain markets. Competition can have a significant impact on tin prices and tin powder demands, and there can be no assurance that TJJV will continue to compete favorably due to quality improvements by its competitors which will affect its business and consequently could materially and adversely affect Gold Avenue's and our business, financial condition and results of operations.. China's entry into the World Trade Organization could increase foreign competition in China, by, among other things, allowing a greater number of alliances between foreign companies and domestic competitors, and revising regulations originally designed to protect domestic enterprises. Such increased foreign competition could materially and adversely affect TJJV's financial condition and results of operations, which could materially and adversely affect Gold Avenue's and our business, financial condition and results of operations.. -36-. Table of Contents. TJJV faces risks relating to product concentration.. It is expected that most of TJJV's turnover in the near future will be from tin powder. Continued and increasing market acceptance of tin powder is therefore critical to its future success. TJJV's business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if demand for tin powder in the market decreases significantly, or if the tin price declines significantly.. In line with TJJV's future strategy to explore other metals such as copper, iron or zinc contained in tin deposits and become a producer of specialty metals and/or related products, it may expand its production portfolio, change the product mix in the future, and develop new lines of other metals and precious metal products. However, there can be no assurance that this will be successful in reducing TJJV's dependence on one product. Successful product development and market acceptance of TJJV's existing and future products will depend on accurate prediction of market requirements, reputation, quality and price of our products and the products of its competitors. There can be no assurance that any products developed and introduced will achieve market acceptance and any such failure to achieve market acceptance may materially and adversely affect TJJV's, Gold Avenue's and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.. Changes in political, economic and legal developments in China or a downturn of the Chinese economy may adversely affect TJJV's results of operations and financial condition.. TJJV's operating business is in China and so depends heavily on the general economic conditions in China for its continued growth. The Chinese economy has traditionally been centrally planned, with a series of economic plans promulgated and implemented by the Chinese government. Since 1978, the Chinese government has been promoting reform of the economic and political systems in China. These reforms have brought about marked economic growth and social progress for China and the economy of China has shifted gradually from a planned economy to a more socialist market-oriented economy. \"Market economy\" and enterprise reform have been emphasized by the Chinese government during the improvement of the freedom and autonomy level in areas such as allocation of resources, production and management with the purpose of reducing the level of direct control from the government.. Although the Chinese economy has grown significantly in recent years, there is no assurance that the Chinese government will continue to pursue economic and political reforms. The economic policies or political measures adopted by the Chinese government may not always be successful or have a positive impact on TJJV's business, operating results and financial conditions. Its operations and financial results could be adversely affected by changes in the political, economic and social conditions or the relevant policies of the Chinese Government, such as changes in laws and regulations (or the interpretations thereof), implementation of new anti-inflationary measures, changes in the rate or methods of taxation, further foreign exchange restrictions, the imposition of additional import restrictions, and a downturn in China's economic growth or a decline in its economic condition in general.. All of TJJV's turnover may be denominated in Renminbi, which is not freely convertible for capital account transactions and may be subject to exchange rate volatility.. TJJV is required to obtain foreign exchange for current account transactions (including the distribution of dividends) through the accounts permitted by the Chinese government. There can be no assurance that the Chinese government will not impose restrictions on foreign exchange transactions under these specific current items.. -37-. Table of Contents. TJJV also requires foreign currency to pay dividends to its shareholders. All of its turnover is denominated in Renminbi. Under Chinese foreign exchange rules and regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and operation-related expenditures, may be made in foreign currencies without prior approval but are subject to procedural requirements. Strict foreign exchange control continues to apply to capital account transactions. These transactions must be approved by or registered with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of China, and repayment of loan principal, distribution of return on direct capital investment and investments in negotiable instruments are also subject to restrictions. There can be no assurance that TJJV will be able to meet all of its foreign currency obligations or to remit profits out of China.. Prior to 1994, the Renminbi experienced a significant net devaluation against most major currencies and there was significant volatility in the market-based exchange rate during certain periods. Since 1994, the Renminbi to US dollar exchange rate has largely stabilized. On July 21, 2005, the PBOC announced that the exchange rate of US dollars to Renminbi would be adjusted from US$1 to RMB8.27 to US$1 to RMB8.11 and it ceased to peg the Renminbi to the US dollar. Instead, the Renminbi is now pegged to a basket of currencies, the components of which are adjusted based on changes in market demand and supply under a set of systematic principles. On September 23, 2005, the Chinese government widened the daily trading band for the Renminbi against non-US dollar currencies from 1.5% to 3.0% to improve the flexibility of the new foreign exchange system. The Renminbi could be revalued further against the US dollar or other currencies, or may be permitted to enter into a full or limited free float, which could result in an appreciation or depreciation in the value of the Renminbi against the US dollar or other currencies. Any appreciation of the Renminbi could subject TJJV to increased competition from imports and any devaluation of the Renminbi could adversely affect the dollar value of its net assets and earnings and lower declared dividends in foreign currency terms, as well as affecting its ability to service foreign currency obligations. Moreover, there is no assurance that Renminbi will not become volatile against other foreign currencies or that Renminbi will not be devalued.. It may be difficult to seek recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments or arbitral awards in China.. All of TJJV's assets are located in China and most of the management members and directors of TJJV reside in China.. On July 14, 2006, Hong Kong and China entered into the Arrangement on Reciprocal Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters by the Courts of the Mainland and of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Pursuant to Choice of Court Agreements. Between Parties Concerned, or \"the Arrangement\", pursuant to which a party with a final court judgment rendered by a Hong Kong court requiring payment of money in a civil and commercial case according to a choice of court agreement in writing may apply for recognition and enforcement of such judgment in China. Similarly, a party with a final judgment rendered by a Chinese court requiring payment of money in a civil and commercial case pursuant to a choice of court agreement in writing may apply for recognition and enforcement of such judgment in Hong Kong. A choice of court agreement in writing is defined as any agreement in writing entered into between parties after the effective date of the Arrangement in which a Hong Kong court or a Chinese court is expressly designated as the court having sole jurisdiction for the dispute. Therefore, it is not possible to enforce a judgment rendered by a Hong Kong court in China if the parties in dispute do not agree to enter into a choice of court agreement in writing. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for investors to effect service of process against TJJV's assets, senior management members or directors in China in order to seek recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments in China.. -38-. Table of Contents. China is one of the signatories to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, or the \"New York Convention\", which accordingly allows for the enforcement of arbitral awards given by the arbitration bodies of other New York Convention signatories. Following the resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong by China on July 1, 1997, the New York Convention no longer applies to the enforcement of Hong Kong arbitration awards in other parts of China. A Memorandum of Understanding on the arrangement for reciprocal enforcement of arbitral awards between Hong Kong and China was signed on June 21, 1999. This new arrangement concerning mutual enforcement of arbitration awards between China and Hong Kong was approved by the Supreme People's Court of China and the Hong Kong Legislative Council, and became effective on February 1, 2000.. Notwithstanding the aforesaid arrangements, enforcement of judgments or arbitral awards in China could be very difficult. It may be even more difficult to seek recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards in China if the arbitral awards were given by arbitration bodies that are not signatories to the New York Convention and do not have similar arrangements under the Memorandum of Understanding between Hong Kong and China.. China has not entered into treaties or arrangements providing for the recognition and enforcement in China of judgments of courts in the United States, or most other jurisdictions. Accordingly, it may be difficult to secure recognition and enforcement in China for court judgments obtained in other jurisdictions in relation to any matter not subject to a binding arbitration provision.. Changes in Chinese government policies towards foreign investment in China may adversely affect TJJV's business and results of operations.. TJJV is a foreign-invested enterprise and thus subject to the Chinese government's foreign investment policies and laws. For example, according to the Foreign Investment Catalogue, industries are categorized as encouraged, permitted, restricted or prohibited for the purpose of approving and monitoring inbound foreign investments. Under the Foreign Investment Catalogue previously in effect from January 1, 2005 to November 30, 2007, and the newly promulgated Foreign Investment Catalogue, which became effective on December 1, 2007, Gold Avenue's business falls within the permitted category.. As the Foreign Investment Catalogue is updated every few years to reflect the changing policies on foreign investment in China, all or part of TJJV's business may fall into a restricted or even prohibited category when the government further amends the Foreign Investment Catalogue and if so, it will be subject to stringent restrictions on the operation, development and administration of its business. Consequently, this could materially and adversely affect Gold Avenue's and our business, financial condition and results of operations.. The uncertainty of China's legal system may have an adverse effect on Gold Avenue's and our business and operations, which could limit the legal protection available to potential investors.. Gold Avenue is investing in Parkwick, which has an interest in TJJV that is operating in China and governed by Chinese law. The central and local governments exercise a substantial degree of control over the tin industry in China. TJJV's business is subject to various government policies, regulations, standards and/or other requirements. Any changes to these policies, regulations, standards and/or requirements could increase TJJV's operating costs and may adversely affect its operating results. Any such changes could also constrain future expansion and profitability as well as cause it to incur significant compliance costs and increase its capital requirement.. -39-. Table of Contents. The Chinese legal system is based on a statutory law system. Unlike a common law system, prior legal decisions and judgments have little significance for guidance, and rulings by the court can only be used as reference with little value as precedents. China is still in the process of developing a comprehensive statutory framework. Since 1979, the Chinese government has established a commercial law system, and significant progress has been made in promulgating laws and regulations relating to economic affairs and matters such as corporate organization and governance, foreign investment, commerce, taxation and trade. However, these regulations are relatively new and the availability of public cases as well as the judicial interpretation of them are limited in number.. Furthermore, as many laws, regulations and legal requirements have only been recently adopted by the central or local government agencies, their implementation, interpretation and enforcement may involve uncertainty due to the lack of established practice available for reference. Depending on the government agency or how an application or a case is presented to such agency, TJJV may receive less favorable interpretations of law than its competitors. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial legal costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Similarly, legal uncertainty in China may limit the legal protection available to potential investors. We and Gold Avenue cannot predict the effect of future legal development in China, including promulgation of new laws, changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, or the pre-emption of local regulations by national law. As a result, there is substantial uncertainty as to the legal protection available to potential investors. More stringent laws or regulations may also restrict TJJV's operations and adversely affect its business prospects. Compliance with or failure to comply with such laws or regulations may require it to incur significant capital expenditures or other obligations or liabilities, or even the suspension of its operations and thus materially and adversely affect its business and results of operations, which could materially and adversely affect Gold Avenue's and our business, financial condition and results of operations.. A change in Chinese tax law may affect dividends received by Parkwick and finally affect the dividends to Gold Avenue's shareholders.. Gold Avenue is incorporated in Hong Kong and through its 10% potential holding (after full conversion of the convertible bond) in Parkwick, a Hong Kong private company, it would hold an indirect interest in TJJV. The Chinese Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules were enacted respectively on March 16, 2007 and December 6, 2007, both of which have become effective as of January 1, 2008. Under the new law and regulations, if a foreign investor to a foreign-invested enterprise in China is a non-Chinese tax resident enterprise without an establishment in China, a withholding tax at the rate of 10% will be applicable to any dividends paid to the foreign investor by the foreign-invested enterprise. According to the tax arrangement between China and Hong Kong, dividends paid by a foreign-invested enterprise in China to its shareholder(s) which is/are incorporated in Hong Kong will be subject to a withholding tax at a reduced rate of 5% if the Hong Kong company directly holds a 25% or more interest in the Chinese enterprise. Therefore, the income tax rate applied to Parkwick, a 66% equity interest holder of TJJV, is 5%.. The tin products produced and sold by TJJV are subject to VAT. China's regular VAT rate is 17%. It is customary practice in China for the purchaser to assume the VAT costs.. The exploitation of minerals products prescribed in the Chinese Resources Tax regulations in China is subject to the Chinese Resources Tax. Resources Tax is levied, generally on tonnage crude ore, at specified rates on natural resource products. The tax rate for tin is Renminbi 0.6-1 yuan / ton, depending on the quality of tin ores. Pursuant to the Chinese Resources Tax regulations, exploitations of the non-ferrous metals, including tin, are eligible for Resources Tax incentives of 30% reduction of total tax payable. An increase in VAT rate may adversely affect Gold Avenue's and our financial condition and operating results.. -40-. Table of Contents. TJJV should not be liable for Resources Tax as it is in the business of recovery of tin from tailings. YTG, the holder of the mining license for those sites, should have paid Resources Tax on crude ore that were used for primary processing when YTG sold tin products. However, if no Resources Tax has been paid on the ore, the mining license holder should pay the tax on the tailings. In such event, YTG might push the costs of tax to TJJV, which may adversely affect TJJV's financial conditions and operations.. RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK. Shares eligible for future sale may adversely affect our ability to sell equity securities.. Sales of our Common Stock (including the issuance of shares upon conversion of our preferred stock (the \"Preferred Stock\")) in the public market could materially and adversely affect the market price of shares because prior sales have been executed at or below our current market price. We have outstanding four series of Preferred Stock that convert to our Common Stock at prices equivalent to $4.42, $4.00, $4.42, and $9.00, respectively, for our series A convertible preferred stock (\"Series A Preferred Stock\"), series B convertible preferred stock (\"Series B Preferred Stock\"), series C convertible preferred stock (\"Series C Preferred Stock\"), and series D convertible preferred stock (\"Series D Preferred Stock\") (subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and similar dilutive events). Our obligation to convert our Preferred Stock upon demand by the holders may depress the price of our Common Stock and also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.. -41-. Table of Contents. As of June 30, 2009 we had 17,806,586 shares of Common Stock outstanding, plus (1) 32,500 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, convertible into approximately 183,823 shares of Common Stock at the conversion rate of 1:5.6561, (2) 9,464 shares of Series B Preferred Stock convertible into approximately 59,150 shares of Common Stock at the conversion rate of 1:6.25, (3) 45,536 shares of Series C Preferred Stock convertible into approximately 257,556 shares of Common Stock at the conversion rate of 1:5.6561, (4) 109,200 shares of Series D Preferred Stock convertible into approximately 303,336 shares of Common Stock at the conversion rate of 1:2.7778, (5) 1,849,736 options to purchase shares of Common Stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $8.61 per share, and (6) 960,100 warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $7.99. Of the shares outstanding, 17,142,672 shares of Common Stock are freely tradable without restriction. All of the remaining 663,914 shares are restricted from resale, except pursuant to certain exceptions under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\").. Our outstanding options and warrants may adversely affect our ability to consummate future equity financings due to the dilution potential to future investors.. We have outstanding options and warrants for the purchase of shares of our Common Stock which may adversely affect our ability to consummate future equity financings. To the extent any such options and warrants are exercised, the value of our outstanding shares of our Common Stock may be diluted.. As of June 30, 2009, we have outstanding vested options to purchase 1,778,947 shares of Common Stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $8.70 and vested warrants to purchase 940,100 shares of Common Stock with a weighted-average price of $7.97.. Due to the number of shares of Common Stock we are obligated to sell pursuant to outstanding options and warrants described above, potential investors may not purchase our future equity offerings at market price because of the potential dilution such investors may suffer as a result of the exercise of the outstanding options and warrants.. The market price of our Common Stock has experienced significant volatility.. The securities markets from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In addition, the market prices of the Common Stock of many publicly traded pharmaceutical companies have been and can be expected to be especially volatile. Our Common Stock price in the 52-week period ended March 31, 2009 had a high of $1.64 and a low of $0.06, and on July 10, 2009 had a high of $0.20 and a low of $0.20. Announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors, developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights, publicity regarding actual or potential clinical trial results relating to products under development by us or our competitors, regulatory developments in both the United States and foreign countries, delays in our testing and development schedules, public concern as to the safety of pharmaceutical drugs and economic and other external factors, as well as period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results, may have a significant impact on the market price of our Common Stock. The realization of any of the risks described in these \"Risk Factors\" may have a significant adverse impact on such market prices.. -42-. Table of Contents. We may pay vendors and advisors in stock as consideration for their services. This may result in stockholder dilution, additional costs and difficulty retaining certain vendors.. In order for us to preserve our cash resources, we have previously paid and may in the future pay vendors and advisors in shares, warrants or options to purchase shares of our Common Stock rather than cash. Payments for services in stock may materially and adversely affect our stockholders by diluting the value of outstanding shares of our Common Stock. In addition, in situations where we have agreed to register the shares issued to a vendor or advisor, we may incur additional expenses associated with such registration. Paying vendors or advisors in shares, warrants or options to purchase shares of Common Stock may also limit our ability to contract with the vendor or advisor of our choice should that vendor or advisor decline payment in stock.. We do not intend to pay dividends on our Common Stock. Until such time as we pay cash dividends, our stockholders must rely on increases in our stock price for appreciation.. We have never declared or paid dividends on our Common Stock. We intend to retain future earnings to develop and commercialize our products and therefore we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Until such time as we determine to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock, our stockholders must rely on increases in our Common Stock's market price for appreciation.. We incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which may adversely affect our operating results and failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could cause investors to lose confidence in our operating results and in the accuracy of our financial reports and could have a material adverse effect on our business and on the price of our Common Stock.. As a public company, we are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for our 2009 fiscal year. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to and report on our management's evaluation beginning with our fiscal year ending March 31, 2010. We have and will continue to incur significant expenses and management resources to comply with the requirements of Section 404 on an ongoing basis. Management is responsible for implementing controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is disclosed accurately and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. In the event that we are not able to demonstrate compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, we may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities such as the SEC or Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\") and investors may lose confidence in our operating results and our stock price could decline.. -43-. Table of Contents. Furthermore, as a public company, we incur significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and FINRA may increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards, we fail to comply, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.. Failure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage and/or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on committees of our board of directors, or as executive officers.. There are limitations on the liability of our directors, and we may have to indemnify our officers and directors in certain instances.. Our certificate of incorporation limits, to the maximum extent permitted under Delaware law, the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duties as directors. Our bylaws provide that we will indemnify our officers, directors, employees and other agents to the fullest extent permitted by law. These provisions may be in some respects broader than the specific indemnification provisions under Delaware law. The indemnification provisions may require us, among other things, to (i) indemnify such persons against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status with or service to the Company (other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct of a culpable nature), (ii) advance expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against such persons as to which they could be indemnified and (iii) obtain directors' and officers' insurance. Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that a corporation may indemnify a director, officer, employee or agent made or threatened to be made a party to an action by reason of the fact that he or she was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or was serving at the request of the corporation, against expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such action if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. Delaware law does not permit a corporation to eliminate a director's duty of care and the provisions of our certificate of incorporation have no effect on the availability of equitable remedies, such as injunction or rescission, for a director's breach of the duty of care.. -44-. Table of Contents. We believe that our limitation of officer and director liability assists us to attract and retain qualified officers and directors. However, in the event an officer, a director or our board of directors commits an act that may legally be indemnified under Delaware law, we will be responsible to pay for such officer(s) or director(s) legal defense and potentially any damages resulting therefrom. Furthermore, the limitation on director liability may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors, and may discourage or deter stockholders from instituting litigation against directors for breach of their fiduciary duties, even though such an action, if successful, might benefit us and our stockholders. Given the difficult environment and potential for incurring liabilities currently facing directors of publicly-held corporations, we believe that director indemnification is in our and our stockholders' best interests because it enhances our ability to attract and retain highly qualified directors and reduce a possible deterrent to entrepreneurial decision-making.. Nevertheless, limitations of director liability may be viewed as limiting the rights of stockholders, and the broad scope of the indemnification provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could result in increased expenses. Our board of directors believes, however, that these provisions will provide a better balancing of the legal obligations of, and protections for, directors and will contribute positively to the quality and stability of our corporate governance. Our board of directors has concluded that the benefit to stockholders of improved corporate governance outweighs any possible adverse effects on stockholders of reducing the exposure of directors to liability and broadened indemnification rights."
