[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors.. Each reader should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and other factors described below, in addition to the other information set forth in this report, because they could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows, prospects, and the value of an investment in IS&S common stock.. Risks Related to IS&S Business. Growth of the Company's customer base could be limited by delays or difficulties in completing development and introduction of planned products or product enhancements. If IS&S fails to enhance existing products, or to develop and achieve market acceptance for flat panel displays, flight management systems and other new products that meet customer requirements, its business, reputation and statements of operations may be affected adversely.. Currently, IS&S spends a large portion of its R&D efforts in developing and marketing the FPDS, FMS, ThrustSense Autothrottle and complementary products. The Company's ability to grow and diversify its operations through introduction and sale of new products is dependent upon the continued success in product development and engineering activities, its sales and marketing efforts, and regulatory approvals to sell such products. Sales growth will depend in part on market acceptance of and demand for the FPDS, FMS, and future products. IS&S cannot be certain that it will be able to develop, introduce or market its FPDS, FMS, or other new products or product enhancements in a timely or cost-effective manner, or that any new products will receive market acceptance or necessary regulatory approval. In addition, the Company's business is dependent upon maintaining its reputation and relationships with existing customers. If the Company's performance does not meet its customers' expectations, the Company's reputation and its relationships could be damaged, which may have a material adverse impact on the Company's business and statements of operations, including reductions in sales.. In seeking new customers, the Company may have difficulty in displacing the products of incumbent competitors. IS&S cannot be assured that potential customers will accept its products or that existing customers will not abandon them.. The Company's revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, which may cause its stock price to decline.. The Company's revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter because of a number of factors, including:.                   demand for products and/or delivery schedule changes by its customers;.                   capital expenditure budgets of aircraft owners and operators, and appropriation cycles of the U.S. government;.                   changes in the use of the Company's products, including air data systems, flat panel displays, and flight management systems;.                   delays in introducing or obtaining government approval for new products;.                   new product introductions by competitors;.                   changes in IS&S pricing policies or pricing policies of competitors; and.                   costs related to possible acquisition of technologies or businesses.. 13. Table of Contents. The loss of a key customer or a significant deterioration in the financial condition of a key customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.. The Company's revenue is concentrated with a limited number of customers. During fiscal year 2017 IS&S derived 54% of revenue from the top five customers. IS&S expects a relatively small number of customers to account for a majority of its revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result of the concentrated customer base, a loss of one or more of these customers or a dispute or litigation with one of these key customers could affect adversely its revenue and results of operations. The Company monitors and evaluates the credit status of its customers and attempts to adjust sales terms as appropriate. Despite these efforts, a significant deterioration in the financial condition or bankruptcy filing of a key customer could affect adversely the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition.. Contracts can be terminated by customers at any time and, therefore, may not result in sales.. The Company's retrofit projects are generally pursuant to either a direct contract with a customer or a subcontract with a general contractor to a customer (including government agencies). Each contract, including contracts with government agencies, includes various terms and conditions that impose certain requirements on IS&S, including the ability of the government agency or general contractor to alter the price, quantity or delivery schedule of the products. Additionally, each government agency or general contractor retains the right to terminate the contract at any time at its convenience. Upon alteration or termination of these contracts, IS&S is entitled typically to an equitable adjustment to the contract price so that it would be compensated for delivered items and allowable costs incurred. Accordingly, because these contracts can be terminated, the Company cannot be assured that its backlog will result in sales. For example, in October 2014, Delta issued a cancellation notice to the Company purporting to terminate its contract with IS&S resulting in $61.9 million of debookings with respect thereto.. The Company enters into fixed-price contracts or service arrangements to perform specified design and EDC services related to its products that could subject IS&S to losses in the event the Company incurs cost overruns on its projects.. During fiscal 2017, approximately 4% percent of the Company's total sales were from fixed-price EDC arrangements with customers to perform specified design and EDC services related to its products. These arrangements allow IS&S to benefit by recovering some of its product development costs, but it carries the risk of potential cost overruns. If the Company's initial cost estimates are incorrect, it can incur potentially large one time charges and losses on these contracts. These EDC arrangements can expose the Company to potential losses because the customer may compel IS&S to complete a project or, in the event of a termination for default, pay the incremental cost of its replacement by another provider. Because some of these projects involve new technologies and applications, and can last for more than a year, unforeseen events such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials, problems with subcontractors, and cost overruns can result in the contractual price becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to IS&S over time. Furthermore, if the Company does not meet project deadlines or if its products do not meet customer specifications, it may need to renegotiate contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or liquidated damages, or suffer losses if the customer exercises its right to terminate. The Company's results of operations are dependent on its ability to maximize earnings from the EDC service arrangements. Lower earnings caused by cost overruns could have a negative impact on the Company's financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.. Reductions in government expenditures could adversely affect IS&S business.. Reductions in funding of the DoD and U.S. defense spending could have significant consequences to the Company's business and industry. While the full impact of such reductions is not determinable, the impact of any resulting reductions in defense appropriations, and/or reductions in U.S. defense spending could result in delays in procurement of products and services due to lack of funding, and negatively affect the IS&S's revenues, financial condition and results of operations.. Volatility and weakness in capital markets may adversely affect credit availability and related financing costs, which could adversely affect IS&S.. Bank and capital markets can experience periods of volatility and disruption. During these periods of volatility and disruption, risks to IS&S include:.                   declines in revenues and profitability from reduced orders, payment delays or other factors caused by the economic.                   problems of customers;.                   reprioritization of government spending away from defense programs in which IS&S participates;. 14. Table of Contents.                   reduced access to credit sources; and.                   disruptions in supplies associated with any financial constraints faced by vendors.. A portion of IS&S sales come from government contracts, which could be adversely affected by continued high U.S. federal budget deficits.. A portion of IS&S sales has been, and is expected to continue to be, from defense contractors or government agencies in connection with government aircraft retrofit or original equipment manufacturing contracts. Sales to government contractors and government agencies could decline as a result of DoD spending cuts and general budgetary constraints which may become more severe as the federal budget deficit remains high.. We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance program, which may expose us to unpredictable costs and negatively affect our financial performance.. We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance program and related benefit claims. The estimated liability for the self-funded portion of our insurance program is determined actuarially, based on claims filed historically, demographic factors and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. We maintain stop loss insurance coverage to limit our exposure for the self-funded portion of our health insurance program both on a per employee and aggregate basis, and liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. Unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions or management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense than expected under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the premiums for this coverage could increase in the future, or we could be forced to raise our self-insured retention amounts. If these expenses increase, or if we experience a claim in excess of our reserve and/or coverage limits, it could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.. IS&S depends on key personnel to manage its business effectively, and an inability to retain its key employees could adversely impact the Company's ability to compete.. The Company's success depends on the efforts, abilities, and expertise of its senior management and other key personnel. There can be no assurance IS&S will be able to retain such employees, and the loss of some could damage its ability to execute its business strategy. The Company intends to continue hiring key management, engineering, and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for skilled personnel is intense, and IS&S may not be able to attract or retain additional qualified personnel.. The Company's future success will depend in part on its ability to implement and improve its operational, administrative and financial systems and controls and to manage, train and expand its employee base. IS&S cannot provide assurance that, after giving effect to its cost containment initiatives, that current and planned personnel levels, systems, procedures, and controls will be adequate to support the current and future customer base. In such a circumstance, the Company may not be able to exploit existing and potential market opportunities. Any delays or difficulties encountered could impair the Company's ability to attract new customers or maintain its relationships with existing customers.. IS&S relies on third party suppliers for components of its products, and any interruption in the supply of these components could hinder its ability to deliver products on a timely basis.. The Company's manufacturing process consists primarily of assembling components purchased from its supply chain. The suppliers may not continue to be available to IS&S. If the Company is unable to maintain relationships with key third party suppliers, the development and distribution of its products could be delayed until equivalent components can be obtained and integrated into the products. In addition, substitution of certain components from other manufacturers may require product redesign, FAA or other approval, which could delay the Company's ability to ship products.. If the Company fails to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, it may not be able to accurately report its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in the Company and, as a result, the value of the Company's common stock.. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\") requires, among other things, that the Company maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Company is required to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by management in the. 15. Table of Contents. Company's internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.. The Company's compliance with Section 404 requires that it compile the system and process documentation necessary to perform an appropriate evaluation. During the evaluation and testing process, if the Company identifies one or more material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, it will be unable to assert that its internal control over financial reporting is effective. The Company cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit the Company's ability to accurately report its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If the Company is unable to conclude that its internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if its independent registered public accounting firm determines the Company has a material weakness or significant deficiency in its internal control over financial reporting, the Company could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports, the market price of its common stock could decline, and it could be subject to sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict the Company's future access to the capital markets.. We currently operate without a substantial backlog.. During periods of economic uncertainty, the rate of customer orders can quickly decrease, and a substantial backlog may help promote greater efficiency in production, facilitate business planning and improve revenue visibility. As of September 30, 2017, none of the Company's backlog was expected to be filled beyond fiscal 2018, which is below the Company's historical expectations. As a result, future revenue will be dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter, and may not be predictable with any degree of certainty. Furthermore, certain contracts may represent a significant portion of our revenue and profits for a quarter such that the loss or deferral of even one such contract could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.. Litigation with customers, employees and others could harm our reputation and impact operating results.. In the ordinary course of business, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions with customers, employees and others. Additionally, we may be subject to employment-related claims alleging discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage issues, including those relating to overtime compensation. We are susceptible to claims filed by customers alleging responsibility for breaches of contract or from product defects, and we are also subject to lawsuits filed by patent holders alleging patent infringement. These types of claims, as well as other types of lawsuits to which we are subject from time to time, can distract management's attention from core business operations and impact operating results, particularly if a lawsuit results in an unfavorable outcome, or could harm the Company's reputation with customers, employees, investors and others.. 16. Table of Contents. The Company's competition includes other manufacturers of air data systems and flight information displays against whom it may not be able to compete successfully.. The markets for the Company's products are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Competitors include Honeywell, Rockwell Collins, Inc., Thales, Garmin, GEAS, and L-3 Communications. All these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than does IS&S. In addition, these competitors have much greater experience in and resources for marketing their products. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and customer preferences, or to devote greater resources to development, promotion and sale of their products than IS&S can. The Company's competitors may have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases. Such competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share.. The Company's success depends on its ability to protect its proprietary rights against potential risk of infringement. If IS&S is unable to protect and enforce its intellectual property rights, it may be unable to compete effectively.. The Company's success and ability to compete will depend in part on its ability to obtain and maintain patent or other protection for its technology and products, both in the United States and internationally. In addition, IS&S must operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others.. As of September 30, 2017, IS&S held 39 U.S. patents and has 8 U.S. patent applications pending. In addition, the Company holds 78 international patents and has 24 international patent applications pending. IS&S cannot be certain that patents will be issued on any of its present or future applications. In addition, existing patents or future patents may not adequately protect the Company's technology if they are not broad enough and are successfully challenged, or if other entities are able to develop competing methods without violating its patents. If IS&S is not successful in protecting its intellectual property, competitors could begin to offer products that incorporate the Company's technology. Patent protection involves complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, is highly uncertain. Litigation relating to intellectual property is often very time consuming and expensive. If a successful claim of patent infringement were made against IS&S, and if the Company were unable to develop non-infringing technology, or to license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost-effective basis, the Company might not be able to produce and sell some of its products. Further, IS&S has incurred, and may continue to incur, significant legal and other costs in defense of its intellectual property.. A cyber security incident or other technology disruption could have a negative impact on our business.. We face certain security threats and technology disruptions, including threats to our information technology (\"IT\") infrastructure, attempts to gain access to our or our customers' proprietary or classified information, threats of terrorism events, and failures of our technology tools and systems. Our IT networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to successfully perform day-to-day operations. We are also involved with information technology systems for certain customers and other third parties, for which we face similar security threats as for our own, in particular the DoD. In particular, cybersecurity threats-which include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, spyware and malware, attempts to access information, denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches-are persistent and evolve quickly. In general, such threats have increased in frequency, scope and potential impact in recent years. Further, a variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned IT and technological services provided by outside parties, support our critical functions. These technologies, as well as our products, are subject to failure and the user's inability to have such technologies properly supported, updated, expanded or integrated into other technologies and, in certain cases, may contain open source and third party software which may unbeknownst to us contain defects or viruses that pose unintended risks. These risks, if not effectively mitigated or controlled, could materially harm our business or reputation. While we believe that we have implemented appropriate measures and controls, there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential information or corruption of data.. The security measures we have implemented are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our IT systems. These security systems cannot provide absolute security. To the extent we were to experience a breach of our systems and were unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise impact the use of our information technology systems. Moreover, if a security breach of our information technology system affects our computer systems or results in the release of personally identifiable or other sensitive information of customers, business partners, employees and other third parties, our reputation and brand could be materially damaged, use of our products and services could decrease, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation and potential liability.. 17. Table of Contents. Such an event could require significant management attention and resources, negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Tax changes, including potential tax reform in the United States, could affect the Company's effective tax rate and future profitability.. The Company's future results could be affected negatively by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in the overall profitability and changes to statutory tax rates in the United States, changes in tax legislation, and the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns.. In November 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) and, in December 2017, the U.S. Senate passed a revised version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (together with any amended versions, the \"Tax Reform Bills\"). Either of the Tax Reform Bills, or any likely compromise version of the Tax Reform Bills, would make significant changes to the U.S. income tax rules applicable to both individuals and entities, including corporations. There is significant uncertainty as to the likelihood, timing, or details of any Tax Reform Bill being enacted and the impact of any such Tax Reform Bill on the Company.. A variety of tax reform proposals that could impact U.S. taxation of corporations are under consideration, including amendments to the applicability of the alternative minimum tax, reductions in research and development tax credits, reductions in the amount of executive pay that qualify for deduction and reductions in the U.S. corporate income tax rate. We cannot predict which, if any, of these proposals will be enacted into law in the final version of the Tax Reform Bill, if any. If a Tax Reform Bill were enacted, it could have a material effect on our financial statements and after-tax financial results.. The economic effects of \"Brexit\" may affect relationships with existing and future customers and could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results.. On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (the \"U.K.\") held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (\"E.U.\"), commonly referred to as \"Brexit.\" The referendum is non-binding; however, it is expected to be passed into law, after which negotiations will commence to determine the future terms of the U.K.'s relationship with the E.U. The impact on the Company's business as a result of Brexit will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations.. As a result of the referendum, the global markets and currencies have been adversely impacted, including a sharp decline in the value of the British pound as compared to the U.S. dollar. A potential devaluation of the local currencies of our international customers relative to the U.S. dollar may impair the purchasing power of our international customers and could cause international customers to decrease their volume of orders or cancel orders completely.. Volatility in exchange rates resulting from Brexit is expected to continue in the short term as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the E.U. We translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for our financial statements. During periods of a strengthening dollar, our reported international sales and earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer U.S. dollars.. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate, and those laws and regulations may be cumbersome, difficult or costly in terms of compliance. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.. Risks Related to the Company's Industry. If IS&S is unable to respond to rapid technological change, its products could become obsolete and its reputation could suffer.. Future generations of flat panel displays, air data systems, engine and fuel displays, and flight management systems which embody new technologies or new industry standards could render the Company's products obsolete. The market for aviation products is subject to rapid technological change, new product introductions, changes in customer preferences, and evolving industry standards and government regulations. The Company's future success will depend on its ability to:.                   embrace rapidly changing technologies;.                   adapt the Company's products to evolving industry standards and government regulations; and.                   develop and introduce timely, high quality, cost effective new products, and product enhancements to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers.. 18. Table of Contents. If IS&S fails to modify or improve its products in response to evolving industry standards and government regulations, its products could rapidly become obsolete.. The Company's products are currently subject to direct regulation by the FAA and other equivalent organizations. The Company's products, as they relate to aircraft applications, must be approved by the FAA, EASA, or other equivalent organizations before they can be installed in an aircraft. To be certified, IS&S must demonstrate that its products are accurate and able to maintain certain levels of repeatability over time. Although certification requirements of the FAA and EASA are substantially similar, no formal reciprocity exists between the two regulators. Accordingly, even though the Company's products are FAA approved, it may need to obtain approval from EASA or other appropriate organizations to have them certified for installation outside the United States.. Significant delay in receiving certification for newly developed products or enhancements to the Company's products, or the loss of certification for its existing products, could result in lost sales or delays in sales. Furthermore, new regulations or product standards, and changes to existing product standards could require IS&S to change its products and underlying technology. IS&S cannot ensure that it will receive regulatory approval on a timely basis or at all.. Inasmuch as the Company's products utilize sophisticated technology and are deployed in complex aircraft cockpit environments, problems with these products may arise that could harm the Company's reputation for quality assurance and, consequently, its business prospects.. The Company's products use complex system designs and components that may contain errors, omissions, or defects, particularly when the Company incorporates new technologies into its products or when it releases new versions or enhancements of its existing products. Despite the Company's quality assurance process, errors, omissions or defects could occur in its current products, in new products, or in new versions or enhancements of existing products. IS&S may be required to redesign or recall those products or pay damages. Such an event could result in the following:.                   delay or loss of revenues;.                   cancellation of customer contracts;.                   diversion of development resources;.                   damage to the Company's reputation;.                   increased service and warranty costs; or.                   litigation costs.. Although IS&S carries product liability insurance, this insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses in the event of a large product liability claim. In addition, IS&S may not be able to maintain such insurance in the future.. 19. Table of Contents. The Company has limited experience in marketing and distributing its products internationally.. IS&S plans to derive increasing revenues from sales outside the United States, particularly in Europe. Risks inherent in doing business internationally include:.                   differing regulatory requirements;.                   legal uncertainty regarding liability;.                   tariffs, trade barriers, and other regulatory barriers;.                   political and economic instability;.                   changes in diplomatic and trade relationships;.                   potentially adverse tax consequences;.                   the impact of recessions in economies outside the United States; and.                   variances and unexpected changes in local laws and regulations.. Currently, all of the Company's international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. An increase in the dollar's value compared to other currencies could render its products less competitive in the international markets. In the future, IS&S may be required to conduct sales in the foreign country's local currency, thus exposing the Company to fluctuations and volatility in exchange rates that could adversely affect its operating results."
