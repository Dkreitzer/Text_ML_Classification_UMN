[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, investors should consider carefully the following risk factors, which may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline.. Oil, natural-gas and NGLs prices are volatile. A substantial or extended decline in prices could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. Prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs (Natural Gas Liquids) can fluctuate widely. Our revenues, operating results and future growth rates are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our oil, natural gas and NGLs. Historically, the markets for oil, natural gas and NGLs have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. For example, in recent years market prices for natural gas in the United States have declined substantially from the highs achieved in 2008, and the rapid development of shale plays throughout North America has contributed significantly to this trend.. 14. Table of Contents. A significant decline in crude oil prices started in October 2014, continued through 2015 and slightly rebounded towards the end of 2016, which continued through the end of 2017. As a result, we experienced decreases in crude oil revenues and recorded asset impairment charges due to commodity price declines. If crude oil prices were continue to decline again, further operating asset impairment and our profitability will likely be negatively affected.. Factors influencing the prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:. <U+25CF>  the worldwide military and political environment, uncertainty or instability resulting from the escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities or further acts of terrorism in the United States, or elsewhere, particularly Israel;. <U+25CF>  global factors impacting supply quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, in particular, US crude oil and NGL supply growth resulting from shale oil development;. <U+25CF>  the extent to which US shale producers become swing producers, yielding additional non-OPEC crude oil supply;. <U+25CF>  political conditions and events (including instability or armed conflict) in hydrocarbon-producing regions;. <U+25CF>  actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations;. <U+25CF>  the level of global crude oil and natural gas inventories;. <U+25CF>  further application of horizontal drilling techniques which could increase production and significantly impact both domestic and global supplies of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs;. <U+25CF>  the price and level of foreign imports of oil, natural gas and NGLs;. <U+25CF>  the effect of worldwide energy conservation efforts;. <U+25CF>  actions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which we refer to as OPEC;. <U+25CF>  the price and availability of alternative and competing fuels;. <U+25CF>  technology advances that increase crude oil, natural gas and NGL production, thereby increasing supply;. <U+25CF>  the cost of exploring for, developing, producing, transporting, and marketing oil, natural gas, and NGLs;. <U+25CF>  the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure;. <U+25CF>  the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity;. <U+25CF>  consumer demand for oil, gas and NGLs;. <U+25CF>  the growth of consumer product demand in emerging markets, such as India and China;. <U+25CF>  fuel efficiency regulations, such as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, and its impacts on crude oil demand as a transportation fuel;. <U+25CF>  labor unrest in oil and natural gas producing regions;. <U+25CF>  regional pricing differentials;. <U+25CF>  weather conditions;. <U+25CF>  electricity needs;. <U+25CF>  the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulation (including environmental regulation and regulation of derivatives transactions and hedging activities) and taxation; and. <U+25CF>  the overall economic environment.. The long-term effect of these and other factors on the prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs are uncertain. Prolonged or substantial declines in these commodity prices may have the following effects on our business:. <U+25CF>  adversely affecting our financial condition, liquidity, ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations;. <U+25CF>  reducing the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can produce economically;. <U+25CF>  reducing our revenues, profit margins, operating income and cash flows;. <U+25CF>  certain properties in our portfolio becoming economically unviable;. <U+25CF>  delay or postponement of some of our capital projects;. <U+25CF>  reducing the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties;. <U+25CF>  reducing the amounts of our estimated proved oil and natural-gas reserves;. <U+25CF>  reducing the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and natural-gas reserves; and. <U+25CF>  limiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt; and. <U+25CF>  additional counterparty credit risk exposure on commodity hedges.. <U+25CF>  asset impairment charges resulting from reductions in the carrying values of our crude oil and natural gas properties at the date of assessment;. 15. Table of Contents. Depending on the market prices of oil and gas, oil and gas exploration and production companies may cancel or curtail their drilling programs and may lower production spending on existing wells, thereby reducing demand for our production services. Many factors beyond our control affect oil and gas prices, including:. <U+25CF>  the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;. <U+25CF>  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;. <U+25CF>  the rate of decline of existing and new oil and gas reserves;. <U+25CF>  the ability of oil and gas exploration and production companies to raise capital;. <U+25CF>  economic conditions in the United States, Israel and elsewhere;. <U+25CF>  the price of foreign imports of oil and gas.. Our domestic operations are subject to governmental risks that may impact our operations.. Our domestic operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and are subject to complex federal, state, tribal, local and other laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, permitting, changes in taxes, deductions, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering-rate controls, hydraulic fracturing and environmental protection regulations. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state, tribal and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws, including environmental and tax laws, and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. For example, currently proposed federal legislation, that, if adopted, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, includes the following:. <U+25CF>    Climate Change. A number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing emissions of green-house gases (GHGs). In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has made findings that emissions of GHGs present a danger to public health and the environment and, based on these findings, has adopted regulations that restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. We may be required to install \"best available control technology\" to limit emissions of GHGs from any new or significantly modified facilities that we may seek to construct in the future if they would otherwise emit large volumes of GHGs.        <U+25CF>    Taxes. On December 22, 2017, the United States Congress enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Reform Legislation\"). The Tax Reform Legislation, among other things, (i) permanently reduces the US corporate income tax rate to 21% beginning in 2018, (ii) repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) allowing for corresponding refunds of prior period AMT credits,  (iii) provides for a five year period of 100% bonus depreciation followed by a phase-down of the bonus depreciation percentage, (iv) imposes a new limitation on the utilization of net operating losses generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and (v) provides for more general changes to the taxation of corporations, including changes to the deductibility of interest expense, the adoption of a modified territorial tax system, assessing a repatriation tax or \"toll-charge\" on undistributed earnings and profits of US-owned foreign corporations, and introducing certain anti-base erosion provisions. The Tax Reform Legislation is complex and far-reaching and could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that currently are available with respect to oil and gas development, or increase costs.  The ultimate impact of the Tax Reform Legislation may differ from our estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.          In addition, from time to time, legislation has been proposed that, if enacted into law, would make significant changes to US federal and state income tax laws, including (i) the elimination of the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs, (ii) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties; and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. While these specific changes are not included in the Tax Reform Legislation, no accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future, or the timing of any such action. The elimination of such US federal tax deductions, as well as any other changes to or the imposition of new federal, state, local or non-US taxes (including the imposition of, or increases in production, severance or similar taxes) could adversely affect our business and financial condition.        <U+25CF>          Hydraulic Fracturing. This process is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. With regard to our non-operated properties, the operators may choose to apply hydraulic-fracturing techniques in many of our U.S. onshore oil and natural-gas drilling and completion programs. Hydraulic fracturing involves using water, sand or other proppant materials, and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore.. 16. Table of Contents. As explained in more detail below, the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas agencies, although the EPA, the BLM and other federal regulatory agencies have taken steps to review or impose federal regulatory requirements. Certain states in which we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. Certain municipalities have already banned hydraulic fracturing, and courts have upheld those moratoria in some instances. In the past several years, dozens of states have approved or considered additional legislative mandates or administrative rules on hydraulic fracturing.        At the federal level, the EPA has taken numerous actions, including the following: final federal Clean Air Act regulations in 2012 and, more recently, in June 2016 governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing, leak detection, and permitting; published in June 2016 an effluent limitation final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants; and issued in May 2014 an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on its intent to develop regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the BLM finalized rules in March 2015 that impose new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands including, for example, notice to and pre - approval by BLM of the proposed hydraulic fracturing activities; development and pre - approval by BLM of a plan for managing and containing flowback fluids and produced water recovered during the hydraulic fracturing process; implementation of measures designed to protect usable water from hydraulic fracturing activities; and public disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing fluid. Some of these rules are subject to pending challenges and, on March 28, 2017, an executive order was signed directing the EPA and the BLM to review their rules and, if appropriate, to initiate rulemaking to rescind or revise them consistent with the stated policy of promoting clean and safe development of the nation's energy resources, while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production. Accordingly, the EPA and the BLM have taken actions to delay or rescind certain requirements related to hydraulic fracturing activities. In addition, from time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. The adoption of new federal rules or regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing could require us to obtain additional permits or approvals or to install expensive pollution control equipment for our operations, which in turn could lead to increased operating costs, delays and curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, which in turn could materially adversely affect our operations.      In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that \"water cycle\" activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources \"under some circumstances,\" noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. Since the report did not find a direct link between hydraulic fracturing itself and contamination of groundwater resources, we do not believe that this multi-year study report provides any basis for further regulation of hydraulic fracturing at the federal level.      Based on the foregoing, increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process from federal agencies, various states and local governments could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil, natural gas and NGLs, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs and time, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.       <U+25CF>          The federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Oil Pollution Act, the federal Clean Air Act, the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, the Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, the federal Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and their state counterparts and similar statutes are the primary statutes that impose the requirements and provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties and other sanctions for violation of their requirements. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the Environmental Protection Agency \"community right-to-know\" regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require us to organize and report information about the hazardous materials we use in our operations to employees, state and local government authorities and local citizens. In addition, CERCLA, also known as the \"Superfund\" law, and similar state statutes impose strict liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered responsible for the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a facility where a release has occurred, the owner or operator of a facility at the time a release occurred, and companies that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at a particular site. This liability may be joint and several. Such liability, which may be imposed for the conduct of others and for conditions others have caused, includes the cost of removal and remedial action as well as damages to natural resources. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by environmental laws and regulations. It is also common for third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage caused by substances released into the environment.. 17. Table of Contents. The enactment of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on the Company's ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity-price, interest-rate, and other risks associated with its business.. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), enacted in 2010, establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as the Company, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. In its rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC issued a final rule on position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain bona fide hedging transactions or positions are exempt from these position limits. The position-limits rule was vacated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Colombia in September 2012 and the CFTC recently stated that it will appeal the District Court's decision. The CFTC also finalized other regulations, including critical rulemakings on the definition of \"swap,\" \"swap dealer,\" and \"major swap participant.\" Some regulations, however, remain to be finalized and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished. Depending on the Company's classification and the particular nature of its derivative activities, the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations may require the Company to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade-execution requirements in connection with its derivative activities. The Dodd-Frank Act and regulations may also require the counterparties to the Company's derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties. The Dodd-Frank Act and regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks the Company encounters, reduce the Company's ability to monetize or restructure its existing derivative contracts, and increase the Company's exposure to less-creditworthy counterparties. If the Company reduces its use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, the Company's results of operations may become more volatile and its cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect the Company's ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural-gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. The Company's revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.. Drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a high-risk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control.. Drilling crude oil and natural gas wells, including development wells, involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reserves (including \"dry holes\"). As a result, we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells.. Specifically, we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and operating wells, and our drilling operations and those of our third-party operators may be curtailed, delayed or canceled, the cost of such operations may increase and/or our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted, as a result of a variety of factors, including. <U+25CF>  unexpected drilling conditions;. <U+25CF>  title problems;. <U+25CF>  pressure or irregularities in formations;. <U+25CF>  equipment failures or accidents;. <U+25CF>  adverse weather conditions, such as winter storms, flooding and hurricanes, and changes in weather patterns;. <U+25CF>  compliance with, or changes in, environmental laws and regulations relating to air emissions, hydraulic fracturing and disposal of produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes, laws and regulations imposing conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations and other laws and regulations, such as tax laws and regulations;. <U+25CF>  the availability and timely issuance of required governmental permits and licenses;. <U+25CF>  the availability of, costs associated with and terms of contractual arrangements for properties, including mineral licenses and leases, pipelines, rail cars, crude oil hauling trucks and qualified drivers and related facilities and equipment to gather, process, compress, transport and market crude oil, natural gas and related commodities; and. <U+25CF>  the costs of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, hydraulic fracturing services, pressure pumping equipment and supplies, tubular materials, water, sand, disposal facilities, qualified personnel and other necessary equipment, materials, supplies and services.. Our failure to recover our investment in wells, increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators, and/or curtailments, delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators in each case due to any of the above factors or other factors, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For related discussion of the risks and potential losses and liabilities inherent in our crude oil and natural gas operations generally, see the immediately following risk factor.. 18. Table of Contents. Our oil and natural gas activities are subject to various risks that are beyond our control and expose us to potential losses and liabilities, and insurance may not fully protect us against these risks and potential losses and liabilities.. Our operations are subject to many risks and hazards incident to exploring and drilling for, producing, transporting, marketing and selling oil and natural gas. Although we may take precautionary measures, many of these risks and hazards are beyond our control and unavoidable under the circumstances. Many of these risks or hazards could materially and adversely affect our revenues and expenses, the ability of certain of our wells to produce oil and natural gas in commercial quantities, the rate of production and the economics of the development of, and our investment in the prospects in which we have or will acquire an interest. Any of these risks and hazards could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such risks and hazards include:. <U+25CF>  human error, accidents, labor force and other factors beyond our control that may cause personal injuries or death to persons and destruction or damage to equipment and facilities;. <U+25CF>  blowouts, fires, explosions, loss of well control, hurricanes, pollution and equipment failures that may result in damage to or destruction of wells, producing formations, production facilities and equipment;. <U+25CF>  unavailability of materials and equipment;. <U+25CF>  engineering and construction delays;. <U+25CF>  unanticipated transportation costs and delays;. <U+25CF>  adverse weather conditions, such as winter storms, flooding and hurricanes, and other natural disasters;. <U+25CF>  hazards resulting from unusual or unexpected geological or environmental conditions;. <U+25CF>  environmental regulations and requirements;. <U+25CF>  accidental leakage of toxic or hazardous materials, such as petroleum liquids or drilling fluids, into the environment;. <U+25CF>  changes in laws and regulations, including laws and regulations applicable to oil and natural gas activities or markets for the oil and natural gas produced;. <U+25CF>  fluctuations in supply and demand for oil and natural gas causing variations of the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production;. <U+25CF>  hazards resulting from the presence of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) or other contaminants in gas we produce;. <U+25CF>  the availability of alternative fuels and the price at which they become available; and. <U+25CF>  terrorism, vandalism and physical, electronic and cyber security breaches.. To mitigate financial losses resulting from these operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage, including insurance coverage for certain physical damage, comprehensive general liability, and worker's compensation and employer's liability. However, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover us against all of potential losses arising as a result of the foregoing, and for certain risks, such as political risk, business interruption, war, terrorism, and piracy, for which we have limited or no coverage. In addition, we are not insured against all risks in all aspects of our business. The occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.. The high cost or unavailability of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, and other oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.. Our industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs of rigs, equipment, supplies, and personnel are substantially greater and their availability to us may be limited. Additionally, these services may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The high cost or unavailability of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, and other oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.. A portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us.. A portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for various reasons, including, but not limited to, as a result of accidents, weather conditions, loss of gathering, processing, compression or transportation facility access or field labor issues, or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted, our cash flows and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.. 19. Table of Contents. Failure to fund continued capital expenditures could adversely affect our properties.. Our acquisition, exploration, and development activities require substantial capital expenditures. Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations and loans from commercial banks and related parties. Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, prices of crude oil and natural gas, and our success in finding, developing and producing new reserves. If revenues were to decrease as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices or decreased production, and our access to capital were limited, we would have a reduced ability to replace our reserves, resulting in a decrease in production over time. If our cash flows from operations are not sufficient to meet our obligations and fund our capital budget, we may not be able to access debt, equity or other methods of financing on an economic basis to meet these requirements, particularly in the current economic environment. If we are not able to fund our capital expenditures, interests in some properties might be reduced or forfeited as a result.. Reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities and the value of our reserves to be materially misstated.. Estimating quantities of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex, inexact process. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors, made by our management and our independent reserve engineering firms; Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. and Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated. Also, the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.. To prepare estimates of our economically recoverable crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves, we analyze many variable factors, such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas. We also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data, and the extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, production costs, severance and excise taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs, many of which factors are or may be beyond our control.. Estimates of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of expected future net cash flows prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues, and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and the variance may be material. The discounted cash flows included in this report should not be construed as the fair value of the estimated oil, natural-gas, and NGLs reserves attributable to our properties. The estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on average 12-month sales prices using the average beginning-of-month price. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from the SEC regulation-compliant prices used for purposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves.. Discoveries or Acquisitions of reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production.. The production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted, while related per unit production costs generally increase, due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. Therefore, our estimated proved reserves and future oil, gas and NGL production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, identify additional producing zones in existing wells, secondary or tertiary recovery techniques, or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves. Consequently, our future oil, gas and NGL production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves.. 20. Table of Contents. If we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems and liabilities, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. From time to time, we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties. Although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. We do not inspect every well. Even when we inspect a well, we do not always discover structural, subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise in the future. Even when problems with a property are identified, we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. In addition, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves (as discussed further above), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. Actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. In addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations.. Title to the properties in which we have an interest may be impaired by title defects.. We generally conduct due diligence to review title on significant properties that we drill or acquire. However, there is no assurance that we will not suffer a monetary loss from title defects or title failure. Additionally, undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. Generally, under the terms of the operating agreements affecting our properties, any monetary loss is due to title defects is to be borne by all parties to any such agreement in proportion to their interests in such property. If there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest, we will suffer a financial loss.. There is a possibility that we will lose the leases to our oil and gas properties.. Our oil and gas revenues are generated through oil and gas leases. These leases are conditioned on the performance of certain obligations, primarily the obligation to produce oil and/or gas or engage in operations designed to result in the production of oil and gas. If production ceases and operations are not commenced within a specified time, the lease may be lost. The loss of our leases may have a material and adverse impact on our revenues.. In the case of Israeli-based properties, we have interests in licenses that, subject to certain conditions, may result in leases being granted. The leases are subject to certain obligations and are renewable at the discretion of various governmental authorities. As such, if the parties responsible for operations are not able to fulfill their obligations under the leases, the leases may be modified, cancelled, not renewed, or renewed on terms different from the current leases. The modification or cancellation of our leases could eliminate our interests and may have a material and adverse impact on our revenues.. We are subject to complex laws and regulations relating to environmental protection that can adversely affect the cost, manner, and feasibility of doing business.. Our operations and properties are subject to numerous federal, regional, state, tribal, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing the release of pollutants or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations govern the following, among other things:. <U+25CF>  issuance of permits in connection with exploration, drilling and production activities;. <U+25CF>  protection of endangered species;. <U+25CF>  amounts and types of emissions and discharges;. <U+25CF>  generation, management, and disposition of waste materials;. <U+25CF>  reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites; and. <U+25CF>  remediation of contaminated sites.. In addition, these laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for our failure to comply or for any contamination resulting from our operations. Future environmental laws and regulations, such as the restriction against emission of pollutants from previously unregulated activities or the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we operate, may negatively impact our industry. The cost of satisfying these requirements may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.. 21. Table of Contents. We cannot be certain that the insurance coverage maintained by us will be adequate to cover all losses that may be sustained in connection with all oil and natural gas activities.. We maintain general and excess liability policies, which we consider to be reasonable and consistent with industry standards. These policies generally cover:. <U+25CF>  personal injury;. <U+25CF>  bodily injury;. <U+25CF>  third party property damage;. <U+25CF>  medical expenses;. <U+25CF>  legal defense costs;. <U+25CF>  pollution in some cases;. <U+25CF>  loss or damage to equipment;. <U+25CF>  well blowouts in some cases; and. <U+25CF>  worker's compensation.. As is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we will not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage that we maintain will be sufficient to cover claims made against us in the future.. Reduced demand for or excess capacity of production services could adversely affect our profitability.. Our profitability in the future will depend on many factors, but largely on pricing and utilization rates for our production services. An increase in supply of production servicing rigs and equipment, without a corresponding increase in demand, or decrease in demand for production servicing rigs and equipment could decrease the pricing and utilization rates of our production services, which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability.. Our production services business depends on domestic spending by the oil and natural gas industry, and this spending and our business has been in the past, and may in the future be, adversely affected by industry and financial market conditions that are beyond our control.. We depend on our customers' willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in the United States. Customers' expectations for lower market prices for oil and natural gas, as well as the availability of capital for operating and capital expenditures, may cause them to curtail spending, thereby reducing demand for our services and equipment.. Industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, such as the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and worldwide economic conditions, political instability in oil and natural gas producing countries and merger and divestiture activity among oil and gas producers. The volatility of the oil and natural gas industry and the consequent impact on exploration and production activity could adversely impact the level of drilling and workover activity by some of our customers. This reduction may cause a decline in the demand for our services or adversely affect the price of our services. In addition, reduced discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves in our market areas also may have a negative long-term impact on our business, even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices, to the extent existing production is not replaced and the number of producing wells for us to service declines.. Deterioration in the global economic environment commencing in the latter part of 2008 and continuing throughout 2009 caused the oilfield services industry to cycle into a downturn due to weakened demand. The industry returned to higher activity levels in 2011 and remained higher during the first half of 2012, before another downturn in the second half of 2012, affecting natural gas prices in particular. The industry pricing remained relatively stable through the middle of 2014. However, beginning in the second half of 2014 through the end of 2015 and continued at the beginning of 2016, oil prices declined substantially from historical highs. Towards the end of 2016 and through 2017 we saw an increase in oil prices though they did not reach the same levels prior to the decline beginning in 2014. Any adverse changes in capital markets and declines in prices for oil and natural gas will likely cause oil and natural gas producers to announce reductions in capital budgets for future periods.. 22. Table of Contents. Limitations on the availability of capital, or higher costs of capital, for financing expenditures may cause oil and natural gas producers to make further reductions to capital budgets in the future even if oil or natural gas prices increase from current levels. Any such cuts in spending will curtail drilling programs as well as discretionary spending on production services, which may result in a reduction in the demand for our services, the rates we can charge and our utilization. In addition, certain of our customers could become unable to pay their suppliers, including us. Any of these conditions or events could adversely affect our operating results.. If oil and natural gas prices remain volatile, or if oil or natural gas prices remain low or decline further, the demand for our production services could be adversely affected.. The demand for our services is primarily determined by current and anticipated oil and natural gas prices and the related general production spending and level of drilling activity in the areas in which we have operations. Volatility or weakness in oil prices or natural gas prices (or the perception that oil prices or natural gas prices will decrease) affects the spending patterns of our customers and may result in the drilling of fewer new wells or lower production spending on existing wells. This, in turn, could result in lower demand for our services and may cause lower rates and lower utilization of our production service equipment. If oil prices or natural gas prices continue to remain low or decline further, or if there is a reduction in drilling activities, the demand for our services and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.. Competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense, and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have.. We compete with national oil companies, major integrated oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies and other individual producers for the acquisition of licenses and leases, properties and reserves and the equipment, materials, services and employees and other contract personnel (including geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other specialists) required to explore, develop, produce and market crude oil and natural gas. Some of our competitors may have greater and more diverse resources on which to draw than we do. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects, such as in bidding for drilling rights, acquisition of licenses and leases, properties and reserves or in acquiring necessary services, equipment, materials and personnel. If we are not successful in our competition for oil and gas reserves or in our marketing of production, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.. Poor general economic, business, or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.. During the last few years, concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market, uncertainties with regard to European sovereign debt, and a declining real estate market in the United States have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. Concerns about global economic conditions have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. If the economic recovery in the United States or abroad remains prolonged, demand for petroleum products could diminish or stagnate, which could impact the price at which we can sell our oil, natural gas, and NGLs, affect our vendors', suppliers' and customers' ability to continue operations, and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.. Our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose us to other risks.. In order to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our oil and natural gas production, we sometimes enter into oil and natural gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our anticipated production and we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future. While intended to reduce the effects of volatile oil and natural gas prices, such transactions may limit our potential gains and increase our potential losses if oil and natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge. In addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:. <U+25CF>  our actual production is less than hedged volumes;. <U+25CF>  there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement;. <U+25CF>  the counterparties to our hedging agreements fail to perform under the contracts; or. <U+25CF>  a sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil and natural-gas prices.. 23. Table of Contents. At the time of this report, the Company had no commodity price hedging agreements in place.. The credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect us.. We have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, insurance companies and other institutions. These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. We have exposure to these financial institutions through our derivative transactions. In addition, if any lender under our credit facility is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender's commitment under our credit facility. Moreover, to the extent that purchasers of the Company's production rely on access to the credit or equity markets to fund their operations, there is a risk that those purchasers could default in their contractual obligations to the Company if such purchasers were unable to access the credit or equity markets for an extended period of time.. We have no means to market our oil and gas production without the assistance of third parties.. The marketability of our production depends upon the proximity of our reserves to, and the capacity of, facilities and third party services, including oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines, trucking or terminal facilities, and processing facilities. The unavailability or lack of capacity of such services and facilities could impair or delay the production of new wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. A shut-in, delay or discontinuance could adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, regulation of oil and natural gas production transportation in the United States or in other countries may affect its ability to produce and market our oil and natural gas on a profitable basis.. Our exploration and development drilling efforts and the operation of our wells may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns.. We require significant amounts of undeveloped leasehold acreage to further our development efforts. Exploration, development, drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that commercially productive reservoirs will not be discovered. We invest in property, including undeveloped leasehold acreage, which we believe will result in projects that will add value over time. However, we cannot guarantee that our leasehold acreage will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled by us will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such leasehold acreage or wells. Drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit after deducting operating and other costs. In addition, wells that are profitable may not achieve our targeted rate of return. Our ability to achieve our target results is dependent upon the current and future market prices for oil and natural gas, costs associated with producing oil and natural gas and our ability to add reserves at an acceptable cost.. In addition, we may not be successful in controlling our drilling and production costs to improve our overall return. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. We cannot predict the cost of drilling and completing a well, and we may be forced to limit, delay or cancel drilling operations as a result of a variety of factors, including:. <U+25CF>  unexpected drilling conditions;. <U+25CF>  pressure or irregularities in formations;. <U+25CF>  equipment failures or accidents and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling and completion equipment and services;. <U+25CF>  adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes; and. <U+25CF>  compliance with governmental requirements.. We depend on the skill, ability and decisions of third party operators to a significant extent.. The success of the drilling, development and production of the oil and natural gas properties in which we have or expect to have a non-operating working interest is substantially dependent upon the decisions of such third-party operators and their diligence to comply with various laws, rules and regulations affecting such properties. The failure of any third-party operator to make decisions, perform their services, discharge their obligations, deal with regulatory agencies, and comply with laws, rules and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations in a proper manner with respect to properties in which we have an interest could result in material adverse consequences to our interest in such properties, including substantial penalties and compliance costs. Such adverse consequences could result in substantial liabilities to us or reduce the value of our properties, which could negatively affect our results of operations.. 24. Table of Contents. We depend substantially on the continued presence of key personnel for critical management decisions and industry contacts.. Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees, particularly with respect to providing the critical management decisions and contacts necessary to manage and maintain growth within a highly competitive industry. Competition for qualified personnel can be intense, particularly in the oil and natural gas industry, and there are a limited number of people with the requisite knowledge and experience. Under these conditions, we could be unable to attract and retain these personnel. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.. Our operations in Israel may be adversely affected by unique economic, terrorist activities and political developments.. We have interests in oil and gas leases and in oil and gas licenses in the waters off Israel. These interests are a significant portion of our future production and cash flow and may be adversely affected by terrorist activities, political and economic developments, including the following:. <U+25CF>  war, terrorist acts and civil disturbances, and other political risks;. <U+25CF>  changes in taxation policies;. <U+25CF>  laws and policies of the US and Israel affecting foreign investment, taxation, trade and business conduct;. <U+25CF>  foreign exchange restrictions;. <U+25CF>  international monetary fluctuations and changes in the value of the US dollar, such as the decline of the US dollar; and. <U+25CF>  other hazards arising out of Israeli governmental sovereignty over areas in which we own oil and gas interests.. Oilfield service is a highly competitive, fragmented industry in which price competition could reduce our profitability.. We encounter substantial competition from other oilfield service companies. Our primary market areas are highly fragmented and competitive. The fact that production services equipment are mobile and can be moved from one market to another in response to market conditions heightens the competition in the industry and may result in an oversupply of equipment in an area. Oilfield service companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and the intensity of competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. If demand for drilling or production services improves in a region where we operate, our competitors might respond by moving in suitable rigs and production services equipment from other regions. An influx of equipment from other regions could rapidly intensify competition, reduce profitability and make any improvement in demand for production services short-lived.. Most production services contracts are awarded on the basis of competitive bids, which also results in price competition. In addition to pricing and equipment availability, we believe the following factors are also important to our clients in determining which production services provider to select:. <U+25CF>  the type and condition of each of the competing production servicing rigs;. <U+25CF>  the quality of service and experience of the crews;. <U+25CF>  the safety record of the company providing the services; and. <U+25CF>  the offering of ancillary services.. We could be adversely affected if shortages of equipment, supplies or personnel occur.. From time to time there have been shortages of production services equipment and supplies during periods of high demand which we believe could recur. Shortages could result in increased prices for production services equipment or supplies that we may be unable to pass on to clients. In addition, during periods of shortages, the delivery times for equipment and supplies can be substantially longer. Any significant delays in our obtaining production services equipment or supplies could limit production services operations and jeopardize our relations with clients. In addition, shortages of production services equipment or supplies could delay and adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts for our rigs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. 25. Table of Contents. Our operations require the services of employees having the technical training and experience necessary to achieve the proper operational results. As a result, our operations depend, to a considerable extent, on the continuing availability of such personnel. Shortages of qualified personnel have occurred in our industry. If we should suffer any material loss of personnel to competitors or be unable to employ additional or replacement personnel with the requisite level of training and experience to adequately operate our equipment, our operations could be materially and adversely affected. A significant increase in the wages paid by other employers could result in a reduction in our workforce, increases in wage rates, or both. The occurrence of either of these events for a significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. There are limitations with regard to sales of Tamar Field Production. As noted above, we own an interest in the Tamar Field located offshore Israel. This interest in 2017 accounted for approximately 44% of our consolidated revenues and we expect the interest as a percentage of consolidated revenues to increase significantly if and when payout occurs. We note that the government of Israel allows the owners of Tamar Field production to export fifty percent (50%) of the production that has not yet been committed to supply the Israel domestic market as of the date of the government's decision in this regard.  Accordingly, production from Tamar must first satisfy the minimum amount required to supply the Israeli economy.. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.. In most cases, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our customers delaying or failing to pay our invoices. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers' cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.. We may be unable to implement price increases or maintain existing prices on our core services.. We periodically seek to increase the prices of our services to offset rising costs and to generate higher returns for our stockholders. However, we operate in a very competitive industry and as a result, we are not always successful in raising, or maintaining our existing prices. Additionally, during periods of increased market demand, a significant amount of new service capacity, including new production services rigs may enter the market, which also puts pressure on the pricing of our services and limits our ability to increase or maintain prices. Furthermore, during periods of declining pricing for our services, we may not be able to reduce our costs accordingly, which could further adversely affect our profitability.. Even when we are able to increase our prices, we may not be able to do so at a rate that is sufficient to offset such rising costs. In periods of high demand for oilfield services, a tighter labor market may result in higher labor costs. During such periods, our labor costs could increase at a greater rate than our ability to raise prices for our services. Also, we may not be able to successfully increase prices without adversely affecting our activity levels. The inability to maintain our prices or to increase our prices as costs increase could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.. A member of Isramco's management team owns a significant amount of common stock, giving him influence or control in corporate transactions and other matters, and the interests of these individuals could differ from those other shareholders.. Haim Tsuff, the Company's President, Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, individually and through companies that he beneficially controls own over 73% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of March 12, 2018. As a result, Haim Tsuff is in a position to significantly influence or control the outcome of matters requiring a shareholder vote, including the election of directors, the adoption of an amendment to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, and the approval of mergers and acquisitions, and other significant corporate transactions.. 26. Table of Contents. Our stock price is volatile, could continue to be volatile and has limited liquidity; Accordingly, investors may not be able to sell any significant number of shares of our stock at prevailing market prices.. Investor interest in our common stock may not lead to the development of an active or liquid trading market. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. The stock prices and trading volumes for our stock has fluctuated widely and the average daily trading volume of our stock continues to be limited and may continue for reasons that may be unrelated to business or results of operations. General economic, market and political conditions could also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and investors may be unable to resell their shares of common stock at or above their purchase price. As a result of the limited trading in our stock, it may be difficult for investors to sell their shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices.. We have not paid dividends on our common stock and do not plan to declare dividends in the foreseeable future, and therefore only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to our shareholders.. We have not paid or declared any dividends on our common stock and currently intend to retain any earnings to fund our working capital needs, reduce debt and fund growth opportunities. Any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors it deems relevant, including our financial condition and performance, cash needs, income tax consequences and restrictions imposed by the Texas Business Organizations Code and other applicable laws.. The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings.. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings, disputes and claims that have not yet been fully resolved, and additional disputes and claims may arise in the future. Results of legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty and, regardless of the merit of the claims, these legal proceedings may be expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to the Company's operations and management. The Company may enter into arrangements to settle legal proceedings and other disputes in an attempt to mitigate against the foregoing risks. However, the Company cannot guarantee a favorable result with respect to any resolution of a legal proceeding, whether by settlement or otherwise. If one or more of these legal proceedings were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of the Company's expectations, such resolution could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations."
