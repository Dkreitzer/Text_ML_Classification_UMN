[1] "ITEM 1A.                          RISK FACTORS. Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements for Purposes of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"Act\") provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information, so long as those statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the statements. We wish to take advantage of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Act.. Certain statements in this report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act, and such statements are intended to qualify for the protection of the safe harbor provided by the Act. The words \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"objective,\" \"goal,\" \"project,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"may,\" \"target,\" \"forecast,\" \"guidance,\" \"outlook,\" and similar expressions generally identify forward-looking statements. Similarly, descriptions of our objectives, strategies, plans, goals or targets are also forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements relate to the expectations of management as to future occurrences and trends, including statements expressing optimism or pessimism about future operating results or events and projected sales, earnings, capital expenditures and business strategy.. Forward-looking statements are based upon a number of assumptions and factors concerning future conditions that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate and could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements that are made herein and in other reports and releases are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from those discussed in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the ability for us to maintain normal trade terms with vendors, the ability for us to comply with the various covenant requirements contained in the Revolving Credit Facility agreement (as defined in \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\"), the demand for apparel, and other factors. The demand for apparel and sales volume can be affected by significant changes in economic conditions, including an economic downturn, employment levels in our markets, consumer confidence, energy and gasoline prices, the value of the Mexican peso, and other factors influencing discretionary consumer spending. Other factors affecting the demand for apparel and sales volume include unusual weather patterns, an increase in the level of competition, competitors' marketing strategies, changes in fashion trends, changes in the average cost of merchandise purchased for resale, availability of product on normal payment terms and the failure to achieve the expected results of our merchandising and marketing plans as well as our store opening or relocation plans. Additional assumptions, factors and risks concerning future conditions are discussed in the Risk Factors section of this Form 10-K, and may be discussed from time to time in our other filings with the SEC, including Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. Most of these factors are difficult to predict accurately and are generally beyond our control.. Forward-looking statements are and will be based upon management's then-current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance, and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements.  Although management believes the expectations expressed in forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge, forward-looking statements, by their nature, involve risks, uncertainties and other factors, any one or a combination of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.. Readers should carefully review this Form 10-K in its entirety, including, but not limited to our financial statements and the accompanying notes, and the risks and uncertainties described in this Item 1A.  Readers should consider these risks, uncertainties and other factors carefully in evaluating forward-looking statements.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.  Forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K are made as of the date of this Form 10-K.  We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  Readers are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our public announcements and SEC filings.. Our ability to achieve the results contemplated by forward-looking statements is subject to a number of factors, any one, or a combination, of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.  Described below are certain risk factors that management believes are applicable to our business and the industry in which we operate.  There may also be additional risks that are presently immaterial or unknown.. 10. Table of Contents. Competitive and Operational Risks. We face significant competition in the retail apparel industry, which may adversely affect our sales and profitability.  The retail apparel business is highly competitive. We compete with local, regional, national and online retailers, including department, specialty and discount stores, direct-to-consumer businesses and other forms of retail commerce. The Internet and evolving technologies in retail have led to increased competition as there are fewer barriers to entry and consumers are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop. We compete on many factors, such as merchandise assortment, advertising, price, quality, convenience, guests' shopping experience, store environment, service, loyalty programs and credit availability. Unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of our competitors may create downward pressure on prices and lower demand for our products, which may adversely impact our sales and profitability.. If we are unable to successfully execute our strategies, our operating performance may be significantly impacted.  There is a risk that we will be unable to meet our operating performance targets and goals if our strategies and initiatives are unsuccessful.  Our ability to develop and execute our strategic plan and to execute the business activities associated with our strategic and operating plans may impact our ability to meet our operating performance targets.. Our failure to anticipate and respond to changing guest preferences in a timely manner may adversely affect our operations.  Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and fashion trends in a timely manner.  We attempt to stay abreast of emerging lifestyles and consumer preferences affecting our merchandise.  However, any sustained failure on our part to identify and respond to such trends may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and cash flows.. Failure to successfully operate our Gordmans stores as an off-price retailer, or to grow the Gordmans off-price business as planned may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We operated 58 Gordmans off-price stores during 2017, following the Gordmans Acquisition on April 7, 2017. During 2017, we progressed with converting the Gordmans stores into a true off-price retailer by eliminating promotions and implementing pricing that is competitive with the off-price industry. We view Gordmans as a key growth opportunity for our business. If we are not able to successfully operate the Gordmans stores as an off-price retailer, or grow the Gordmans off-price business as planned, the anticipated scale and profitability may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.. Failure to successfully operate our e-commerce website or fulfill guest expectations may adversely impact our business and sales.   Our e-commerce platform provides another channel to generate sales.  We believe that our e-commerce website will drive incremental sales by providing existing guests another opportunity to shop with us and allowing us to reach new guests.  If we do not successfully meet the challenges of operating an e-commerce website or fulfilling guest expectations, our business and sales may be adversely affected.. Our failure to attract, develop and retain qualified employees may negatively impact the results of our operations. We strive to have well-trained and motivated sales associates provide guests with exceptional service.  Our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including store, service and administrative personnel. Competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will depend on our ability to recruit, train and retain our senior executives and other qualified personnel.. 11. Table of Contents. Supply Chain and Distribution Risks. Risks associated with our vendors from whom our products are sourced may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  Our merchandise is sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors.  All of our vendors must comply with applicable laws, including our required standards of conduct.  Political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade, the ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms and the financial viability of our vendors are beyond our control and may adversely impact our performance.. Risks associated with our carriers, shippers and other providers of merchandise transportation services may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  Our vendors rely on shippers, carriers and other merchandise transportation service providers (collectively \"Transportation Providers\") to deliver merchandise from their manufacturers, both in the United States and abroad, to the vendors' distribution centers in the United States.  Transportation Providers are also responsible for transporting merchandise from their vendors' distribution centers to our distribution centers. We also rely on Transportation Providers to transport merchandise from our distribution centers to our stores and to our guests in the case of online sales.  However, if work slowdowns, stoppages, weather or other disruptions affect the transportation of merchandise between the vendors and their manufacturers, especially those manufacturers outside the United States, between the vendors and us, or between us and our e-commerce guests, our business, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected.. Financial and Liquidity Risks. Our dependence upon cash flows and net earnings generated during the fourth quarter, including the holiday season, may have a disproportionate impact on our results of operations. The seasonal nature of the retail industry causes a heavy dependence on earnings in the fourth quarter. A large fluctuation in economic or weather conditions occurring during the fourth quarter may adversely impact our earnings. In preparation for our peak season, we may carry a significant amount of inventory in advance. If, however, we do not manage inventory appropriately or guest preferences change we may need to increase markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of inventory which will negatively impact our financial results.. Failure to obtain merchandise product on normal trade terms may adversely impact our business, financial condition and cash flows.  We are highly dependent on obtaining merchandise product on normal trade terms.  Failure to meet our performance objectives may cause key vendors and factors to become more restrictive in granting trade credit.  The tightening of credit, such as a reduction in our lines of credit or payment terms from the vendor or factor community, may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and cash flows.  We are also highly dependent on obtaining merchandise at competitive and predictable prices.  If we experience rising prices related to our merchandise, whether due to cost of materials, inflation, transportation costs, or otherwise, our business, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely and materially affected.. There can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected by changes in macroeconomic conditions. Due to our operating cash flow and availability under the Revolving Credit Facility, we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future.  However, there can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be materially and adversely affected by changes in macroeconomic conditions.. 12. Table of Contents. The Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants that may impose operating restrictions and limits our borrowing capacity to the value of certain of our assets. The Revolving Credit Facility agreement contains covenants which, among other things, restrict (i) the amount of additional debt or capital lease obligations, (ii) the payment of dividends, and (iii) the repurchase of common stock under certain circumstances. A violation of any of these covenants may permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access loans and letters of credit and may require the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans.  Our failure to comply with these covenants may have a material adverse effect on our capital resources, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, any material or adverse developments affecting our business may significantly limit our ability to meet our obligations as they become due or to comply with the various covenant requirements contained in the Revolving Credit Facility agreement. In addition, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are limited to the availability under a borrowing base that is determined principally on eligible inventory, and our inventory, cash and cash equivalents are pledged as collateral under the Revolving Credit Facility.  In the event of any material decrease in the amount of or appraised value of our inventory, our borrowing capacity would decrease, which may adversely impact our business and liquidity.  In the event of a default that is not cured or waived, the lenders' commitment to extend further credit under the Revolving Credit Facility may be terminated, our outstanding obligations may become immediately due and payable, outstanding letters of credit may be required to be cash collateralized, and remedies may be exercised against the collateral.  If we are unable to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility, we may not have the necessary cash resources for our operations and, if any event of default occurs, there is no assurance that we would have the cash resources available to repay such accelerated obligations, refinance such indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or cash collateralize our letters of credit, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.. The inability or unwillingness of one or more lenders to fund their commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition. We use the Revolving Credit Facility to provide financing for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, as well as to support our outstanding letters of credit requirements.  The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility are: Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Regions Bank, Bank of America, N.A. and SunTrust Bank. Notwithstanding that we may be in full compliance with all covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility, the inability or unwillingness of one or more of those lenders to fund their commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.. Changes in our private label credit card program may adversely affect our sales and/or profitability. Our private label credit card (\"PLCC\") program facilitates sales and generates additional revenue under our profit sharing agreement with the unrelated third party which owns the PLCC accounts receivable. PLCC sales represented 49% of total department stores sales in 2017, and PLCC guests spend more on average than non-PLCC guests.  We receive a share of the net finance charges, late fees, other cardholder fees, write-offs, and operating expenses generated by the program.  Changes in credit granting standards maintained by the third party, which may be due to macroeconomic trends, could impact our ability to generate new PLCC accounts.  Changes in guest payment patterns could impact profit sharing by impacting fee income, write-offs and operating expense.  If the sales or profit share that we receive from the PLCC decreases due to economic, legal, social, or other factors that we cannot control or predict, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected.. Unexpected costs may arise from our current insurance program and our financial performance may be affected.  Our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, self-insured retentions, limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on the dispersion of our operations.  However, we may incur certain types of losses that we cannot insure or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to acts of war, employee and certain other crime and some natural disasters.  If we incur these losses and they are material, our business could suffer.  Certain material events, including property losses caused by various natural disasters and other types of casualties, may result in sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely impact the availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases.  To offset negative cost trends in the insurance market, we may elect to self-insure, accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage in response to these market changes.  In addition, we self-insure a portion of expected losses under our workers' compensation, general liability and group health insurance programs.  Unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses, including potential increases in medical and indemnity costs, could result in materially different amounts of expense than expected under these programs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  Although we continue to maintain property insurance for catastrophic events, we are self-insured for losses up to the amount of our deductibles.  If we experience a greater number of self-insured or uninsured losses than we anticipate or excessive premium increases, our financial performance may be adversely affected.. 13. Table of Contents. Economic Conditions, Business Disruption and Other External Risks. An economic downturn or decline in consumer confidence may negatively impact our business and financial condition. Our results of operations are sensitive to changes in general economic and political conditions that impact consumer discretionary spending, such as employment levels, taxes, energy and gasoline prices and other factors influencing consumer confidence. We have extensive operations in the South Central, Southeastern, Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic states. Many stores are located in small towns and rural environments that are substantially dependent upon the local economy. We also have concentrations of stores in areas where the local economy is heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry, particularly in portions of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico. A decline in crude oil prices and/or oil or gas exploration may negatively impact employment in those communities, resulting in reduced consumer confidence and discretionary spending. Additionally, approximately 3% of our stores contributing approximately 6% of our 2017 sales are located in cities that either border Mexico or are in close proximity to Mexico. A devaluation of the Mexican peso will reduce the purchasing power of those guests who are citizens of Mexico. In such an event, revenues attributable to these stores could be reduced. In early 2017, 2016 and 2015, we experienced pressure on our business in areas that are heavily dependent on the oil industry and near the Mexican border. If those pressures continue or there is an additional economic downturn or decline in consumer confidence, particularly in the South Central, Southeastern, Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic states and any state from which we derive a significant portion of our net sales (such as Texas or Louisiana), our business, financial condition and cash flows will be negatively impacted and such impact may be material.. We are subject to payment-related risks that may increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business.  We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit cards, debit cards, and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted, making compliance more difficult or costly. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services and pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. On October 1, 2015, the payment cards industry began shifting liability for certain debit and credit card transactions to retailers who do not accept Europay, MasterCard and Visa (\"EMV\") chip technology transactions. We have not yet implemented EMV chip technology. Implementation of the EMV chip technology and receipt of final certification is subject to the time availability of third-party service providers and may require upgrades to our systems and hardware.  Further, we may experience a decrease in transaction volume if we cannot process transactions for cardholders whose card issuer has migrated entirely from magnetic strip to EMV chip enabled cards. Until we are able to fully implement and certify the EMV chip technology in our stores, we may be liable for chargebacks related to counterfeit transactions generated through EMV chip enabled cards, which could negatively impact our operational results, financial position and cash flows.. Unusual weather patterns or natural disasters may negatively impact our financial condition.  Our business depends, in part, on normal weather patterns in our markets.  We are susceptible to unseasonable and severe weather conditions, including natural disasters, such as hurricanes and tornadoes.  Any unusual or severe weather, especially in states such as Texas and Louisiana, may have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, our business, financial condition and cash flow may be adversely affected if the businesses of our key vendors or their merchandise manufacturers, shippers, carriers and other merchandise transportation service providers, including those outside of the United States, are disrupted due to severe weather, such as, but not limited to, hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, tsunamis or floods.. An event adversely affecting any of our buying, distribution or other corporate facilities may result in reduced revenues. Our buying, distribution and other corporate operations are in highly centralized locations.  Our operations may be materially and adversely affected if a catastrophic event (such as, but not limited to, fire, hurricanes, tornadoes or floods) or other disruption impacts the access or use of these facilities. While we have contingency plans that would be implemented in such an event, there are no assurances that we would be successful in obtaining alternative servicing facilities in a timely manner.. War, acts of terrorism, Mexican border violence, public health issues and natural disasters may create uncertainty and may result in reduced revenues.  We cannot predict, with any degree of certainty, what effect, if any, war, acts of terrorism, Mexican border violence, public health issues and natural disasters, if any, will have on us, our operations, the other risk factors discussed herein and the forward-looking statements we make in this Form 10-K.  However, the consequences of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and cash flows.. 14. Table of Contents. The price of our common stock as traded on the New York Stock Exchange may be volatile.  Our stock price may fluctuate substantially due to factors beyond our control, including but not limited to, general economic and stock market conditions, risks relating to our business and industry as discussed above, strategic actions by us or our competitors, variations in our quarterly operating performance and investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives.. Legal and Regulatory Risks. Changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Laws and regulations at the local, state, federal and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that may result from changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, privacy, operations, or environmental issues, among others, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.. Our business may be materially and adversely affected by changes to fiscal and tax policies. A number of factors influence our effective income tax rate, including changes in tax law and related regulations, interpretation of existing laws, and our ability to sustain our reporting positions on examination. Changes in any of those factors could change our effective tax rate, which could adversely affect our results of operations.. We may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings which may adversely affect our business and financial performance.  From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits and regulatory proceedings.  Due to the inherent uncertainties of such matters, we may not be able to accurately determine the impact on us of any future adverse outcome of such matters.  The ultimate resolution of these matters may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.  In addition, regardless of the outcome, these matters may result in substantial cost to us and may require us to devote substantial attention and resources to defend ourselves.. If our trademarks are successfully challenged, the outcome of those disputes may require us to abandon one or more of our trademarks.  We regard our trademarks and their protection as important to our success.  However, we cannot be sure that any trademark held by us will provide us a competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties.  Although we intend to vigorously protect our trademarks, the cost of litigation to uphold the validity and prevent infringement of trademarks can be substantial and the outcome of those disputes may require us to abandon one or more of our trademarks.. Technology Infrastructure, Data Security and Privacy Risks. A disruption of our information technology systems may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.  We are heavily dependent on our information technology systems for day-to-day business operations, including sales, warehousing, distribution, purchasing, inventory control, merchandise planning and replenishment, and financial systems.  Certain of our information technology support functions are performed by third-parties in overseas locations.  While we believe that we are diligent in selecting the vendors that assist us in maintaining the reliability and integrity of our information technology systems, failure by any of these third-parties to implement and/or manage our information systems and infrastructure effectively and securely could result in future disruptions, service outages, service failures or unauthorized intrusions.  Despite our precautionary efforts, our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other things, natural or man-made disasters, technical malfunctions, inadequate systems capacity, power outages, computer viruses and security breaches, which may require significant investment to fix or replace, and we may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays to our operations in the interim. In addition, as part of our normal course of business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential guest information. Potential risks include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) an intrusion by a hacker, (ii) the introduction of malware (virus, Trojan horse, spyware), (iii) hardware failure, (iv) outages due to software defects and (v) human error.  Although we run anti-virus and anti-spyware software and take other steps to ensure that our information technology systems will not be disabled or otherwise disrupted, there are no assurances that disruptions will not occur. The consequences of a disruption, depending on the severity, may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and may expose us to civil, regulatory and industry actions and possible judgments, fees and fines.. 15. Table of Contents. A security breach that results in unauthorized disclosure of guest, employee, vendor or our company information may adversely impact our business, reputation and financial condition. In the standard course of business, we receive, process and store information about our guests, employees, vendors and our business, some of which is entrusted to third-party service providers and vendors.  We also work with third-party service providers and vendors that provide technology, systems and services that we use in connection with the receipt, storage and transmission of this information.  Hardware, software or applications obtained from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise our information security.  We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools (including encryption technology) and monitoring to provide security and oversight for processing, transmission, storage and the protection of confidential information.  Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems (and those of our vendors and third-party service providers) may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism and theft, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events.  Our employees, contractors, vendors or third-party service providers may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to misappropriate such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information.  Additionally, unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery, or other means of deceit. We have programs in place to detect, contain, respond to and report (internally and externally) data security incidents.  However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures to safeguard against or timely disclose all data security breaches or misuses of data. Our management and Board of Directors regularly evaluate the risks associated with information security and our efforts to mitigate those risks. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential guest, employee or company information may severely damage our reputation, cause us to incur significant remediation costs, increase our information security protection costs, expose us to the risks of legal proceedings (including fines or other regulatory sanctions in excess of our insurance limits), disrupt our operations, attract a substantial amount of negative media attention, damage our guest and vendor relationships, increase our insurance premiums, damage our competitiveness, and otherwise have a material adverse impact on our reputation, stock price, business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows."
