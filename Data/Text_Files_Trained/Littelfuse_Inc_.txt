[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.. The Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors it has identified below. Any of the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, or results of operations. These factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance.. The Company’s industry is subject to intense competitive pressures.. The Company operates in markets that are highly competitive. The Company competes on the basis of price, quality, service, and / or brand name across the industries and markets it serves. Competitive pressures could affect the prices the Company is able to charge its customers or the demand for its products.. The Company may not always be able to compete on price, particularly when compared to manufacturers with lower cost structures. Some of the Company’s competitors have substantially greater sales, financial and manufacturing resources and may have greater access to capital than the Company. As other companies enter its markets or develop new products, competition may further intensify. The Company’s failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations.. The Company engages in strategic acquisitions and may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions and / or may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses.. The Company seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions. In the past, the Company has acquired a number of businesses or companies and additional product lines and assets. The Company intends to continue to expand and diversify its operations with additional future acquisitions.. An acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to the Company’s expectations and the price paid for it, or not perform in accordance with the Company’s anticipated timetable.  This could cause the Company’s financial results to differ from expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long term.  The success of these transactions also depends on the Company’s ability to integrate the assets, operations, and personnel associated with these acquisitions. The Company may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with the Company’s operations and may not realize the degree or timing of the benefits that are anticipated from an acquisition.. The Company may also discover liabilities or deficiencies associated with the companies or assets it acquires that were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of the Company’s due diligence review and its ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies acquired or their representatives, as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, the Company may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including tax and accounting charges. Acquisitions may also result in recording of significant additional expenses to the results of operations and recording of substantial intangible assets on the balance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.. Reorganization activities may lead to additional costs and material adverse effects.. In the past, the Company has taken actions to restructure and optimize its production and manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies through relocations, consolidations, plant closings or asset sales. In the future, the Company may take additional restructuring actions including the consolidating, closing or selling of additional facilities. These actions could result in impairment charges and various charges for such items as idle capacity, disposition costs and severance costs, in addition to normal or attendant risks and uncertainties. The Company may be unsuccessful in any of its current or future efforts to restructure or consolidate its business. Plans to minimize or eliminate any loss of revenues during restructuring or consolidation may not be achieved. These activities may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.. The Company may be unable to manufacture and deliver products in a manner that is responsive to its customers’ needs.. The end markets for the Company’s products are characterized by technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements and emerging industry standards. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render its existing products obsolete and unmarketable before it can recover any or all of its research, development, and commercialization expenses on capital investments. Furthermore, the life cycles of its products may change and are difficult to estimate.. 9. Table of Contents. The Company’s future success will depend upon its ability to manufacture and deliver products in a manner that is responsive to its customers’ needs. The Company will need to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address increasingly sophisticated requirements of its customers. The Company invests heavily in research and development without knowing that it will recover these costs. The Company’s competitors may develop products or technologies that will render its products non-competitive or obsolete. If it cannot develop and market new products or product enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner, its business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.. The Company’s ability to manage currency or commodity price fluctuations or supply shortages is limited.. As a resource-intensive manufacturing operation, the Company is exposed to a variety of market and asset risks, including the effects of changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. The Company has multiple sources of supply for the majority of its commodity requirements. However, significant shortages that disrupt the supply of raw materials or result in price increases could affect prices the Company charges its customers, its product costs, and the competitive position of its products and services. The Company monitors and manages these exposures as an integral part of its overall risk management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects on its results. Nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates cannot always be predicted. In addition, because of intense price competition and the Company’s high level of fixed costs, it may not be able to address such changes even if they are foreseeable. Substantial changes in these rates and prices could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, significant portions of its revenues and earnings are exposed to changes in foreign currency rates. As it operates in multiple foreign currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will impact its revenues and expenses. The impact of possible currency devaluation in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations can impact the Company’s results and financial guidance. For additional discussion of interest rate, currency or commodity price risk, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks.. The Company’s effective tax rate could materially increase as a consequence of various factors, including interpretations and administrative guidance in regard to the Tax Act (defined below), U.S. and/or international tax legislation, mix of the Company’s earnings by jurisdiction, and U.S. and foreign jurisdictional tax audits.. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). Among other things, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, adds base broadening provisions which limit deductions and address tax efficient international structures, imposes a one-time tax (the “Toll Charge”) on accumulated earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and enables repatriation of earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries free of U.S. federal income tax. Other than the Toll Charge (which is applicable to the Company for 2017), the provisions will generally be applicable to the Company in 2018 and beyond. In accordance with the guidance provided in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 118, in the fourth quarter of 2017 the Company recorded a charge of $47 million as a provisional reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act, including $49 million for the Toll Charge net of $2 million for other net tax benefits. The Company is continuing to analyze the Tax Act and plans to finalize the estimate within the measurement period outlined in SAB No.118. The final charge may differ from the provisional reasonable estimate (and such difference may be material) if provisions of the Tax Act, and their interaction with other provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, are interpreted differently than interpretations made by the Company in determining the estimate, whether through issuance of administrative guidance, or through further review of the Tax Act by the Company and its advisors. Depending upon future interpretations and administrative guidance in respect of the Tax Act’s base broadening provisions, the Tax Act could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s effective tax rate and cash flows.. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions. Therefore, it is subject to changes in tax laws in each of these jurisdictions and such changes could have a material adverse affect on the Company’s effective tax rate and cash flows. As a U.S. Company with significant non-U.S. operations (generally taxed at rates that are lower than the U.S. statutory rate), it is particularly susceptible to changes in U.S. tax rules. In addition, certain non-U.S. jurisdictions are considering tax legislation based upon recommendations made by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development in connection with its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting study. The outcome of these legislative developments could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s effective tax rate and cash flows.. The tax rates applicable in the jurisdictions within which the Company operates vary widely. Therefore, the Company’s effective tax rate may be adversely affected by changes in the mix of its earnings by jurisdiction.. The Company is also subject to examination of its tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. However, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations.. 10. Table of Contents. A decline in expected profitability of the Company or individual reporting units of the Company could results in the impairment of assets, including goodwill and other long-lived assets.. The Company holds material amounts of goodwill and other long-lived assets on its balance sheet. A decline in expected profitability, particularly if there is a decline in the global economy, could call into question the recoverability of the Company’s related goodwill and other long-lived tangible and intangible assets and require the write down or write off of these assets. Such an occurrence has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.. A significant fluctuation between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the Company's revenue and earnings.. Although the Company's financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, the majority of the Company’s operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign countries. The Company’s most significant net long exposure is to the euro. The Company’s most significant net short exposures are to the Chinese renminbi, Mexican peso, and Philippine peso. Changes in foreign exchange rates and in particular, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition. The Company’s revenues may vary significantly from period to period.. The Company’s revenues may vary significantly from one accounting period to another due to a variety of factors including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in customers’ buying decisions;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in demand for its products;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in its distributor inventory stocking;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Company’s product mix;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Company’s effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcosts and timing of its component purchases;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe effectiveness of its inventory control;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe degree to which it is able to utilize its available manufacturing capacity;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Company’s ability to meet delivery schedules;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic and industry conditions;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlocal conditions and events that may affect its production volumes, such as labor conditions and political instability; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tseasonality of certain product lines.. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer could adversely affect the Company.. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer could result in lower sales revenue and cause a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major U.S. auto manufacturer or significant supplier likely could lead to substantial disruptions in the automotive supply base, resulting in lower demand for the Company’s products, which likely would cause a decrease in sales revenue and have a substantial adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.. The Company is exposed to political, economic, and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business.. The Company has significant operating activities in numerous countries around the globe that contribute significantly to its revenues and earnings. Serving a global customer base and remaining competitive in the global marketplace requires the Company to place its production in countries outside the U.S., including emerging markets, to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain a cost-efficient structure. In addition, the Company sources a significant amount of raw materials and other components from third-party suppliers in low-cost countries. The Company’s operating activities are subject to a number of risks generally associated with multi-national operations, including risks relating to the following:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic conditions;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcurrency fluctuations and exchange restrictions;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timport and export duties and restrictions;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe imposition of tariffs and other import or export barriers;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompliance with regulations governing import and export activities;. 11. Table of Contents. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcurrent and changing regulatory requirements;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical and economic instability;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotentially adverse income tax consequences;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttransportation delays and interruptions;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlabor unrest;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnatural disasters;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tterrorist activities;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpublic health concerns;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimitations on the Company’s ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.. Disruptions in the Company’s manufacturing, supply or distribution chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations.. The Company sources materials and sell product through various international network channels. A disruption could occur within the Company’s manufacturing, distribution or supply chain network. This could include damage or destruction due to various causes including natural disasters or political instability which would cause one or more of these network channels to become non-operational. This could adversely affect the Company’s ability to manufacture or deliver its products in a timely manner, impair its ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or damage to its reputation. Such a disruption could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.. The inability to maintain access to capital markets may adversely affect the Company’s business and financial results.. The Company’s ability to invest in its businesses, make strategic acquisitions, and refinance maturing debt obligations may require access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support short-term borrowings. If the Company is unable to access the capital markets or bank credit facilities, it could experience a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.. Fixed costs may reduce operating results if sales fall below expectations.. The Company’s expense levels are based, in part, on its expectations for future sales. Many of the Company’s expenses, particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed. The Company might be unable to reduce spending quickly enough to compensate for reductions in sales. Accordingly, shortfalls in sales could materially and adversely affect the Company’s operating results.. The volatility of the Company’s stock price could affect the value of an investment in the Company’s stock and future financial position.. The market price of the Company’s stock can fluctuate widely. Between December 31, 2016 and December 30, 2017, the closing sale price of the Company’s common stock ranged between a low of $146.94 and a high of $215.00. The volatility of the stock price may be related to any number of factors, such as volatility in the financial markets, general macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, analysts’ expectations concerning the Company’s results of operations, or the volatility of its revenues as discussed above under “The Company’s Revenues May Vary Significantly from Period to Period.” The historic market price of the Company’s common stock may not be indicative of future market prices. The Company may not be able to sustain or increase the value of its common stock. Declines in the market price of the Company’s stock could adversely affect the Company’s ability to retain personnel with stock incentives, to acquire businesses or assets in exchange for stock and/or to conduct future financing activities with or involving the Company’s common stock.. 12. Table of Contents. The Company is exposed to, and may be adversely affected by, potential security breaches or other disruptions to its information technology systems and data security.. The Company relies on its information technology systems and networks in connection with many of its business activities. Some of these networks and systems are managed by third-party service providers and are not under the Company’s direct control. The Company’s operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to its business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees, and other sensitive matters. As with most companies, the Company has experienced cyber-attacks, attempts to breach its systems, and other similar incidents, none of which have been material. Any future cyber incidents could, however, materially disrupt operational systems; result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise personally identifiable information regarding customers or employees; and jeopardize the security of the Company’s facilities. A cyber incident could be caused by malicious outsiders using sophisticated methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption, and other security defenses. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Information technology security threats, including security breaches, computer malware, and other cyber-attacks are increasing in both frequency and sophistication and could create financial liability, subject the Company to legal or regulatory sanctions or damage the Company’s reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers, and other stakeholders. The Company continuously seeks to maintain a robust program of information security and controls, but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.. The Company’s business may be interrupted by labor disputes or other interruptions of supplies.. A work stoppage could occur at certain of the Company’s facilities, most likely as a result of disputes under collective bargaining agreements or in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements. In addition, the Company may experience a shortage of supplies for various reasons, such as financial distress, work stoppages, natural disasters or production difficulties that may affect one of its suppliers. A significant work stoppage, or an interruption or shortage of supplies for any reason, if protracted, could substantially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. The transfer of the Company’s manufacturing operations and changes in its distribution model could disrupt operations for a limited time.. Failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could affect the Company’s business results.. The Company’s success, both generally and in connection with mergers and acquisitions, depends on the Company’s ability to attract, retain, and motivate a highly-skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that the Company has the depth and breadth of personnel with the necessary skill set and experience could impede its ability to deliver growth objectives and execute the Company’s strategy. Competition for qualified employees among companies that rely heavily upon engineering and technology is at times intense, and the loss of qualified employees could hinder the Company’s ability to conduct research activities successfully and develop marketable products.. Environmental liabilities could adversely impact the Company’s financial position.. Foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the discharge of materials, chemicals and gases used in the Company’s manufacturing processes or in its finished goods. These environmental regulations have required the Company to expend a portion of its resources and capital on relevant compliance programs. Under these laws and regulations, the Company could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if its current or former properties are contaminated or if it sends waste to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated, even if the Company did not cause the contamination. The Company may be subject to additional common law claims if it releases substances that damage or harm third parties. In addition, future changes in environmental laws or regulations may require additional investments in capital equipment or the implementation of additional compliance programs. Any failure to comply with new or existing environmental laws or regulations could subject the Company to significant liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.. In the conduct of manufacturing operations, the Company has handled and does handle materials that are considered hazardous, toxic or volatile under federal, state, and local laws. The risk of accidental release of such materials cannot be completely eliminated. In addition, the Company operates or owns facilities located on or near real property that was formerly owned and operated by others. Certain of these properties were used in ways that involved hazardous materials. Contaminants may migrate from, within or through these properties. These releases or migrations may give rise to claims. Where third parties are responsible for contamination, the third parties may not have funds, or not make funds available when needed, to pay remediation costs imposed upon the Company under environmental laws and regulations.. The Company is responsible for the maintenance of discontinued coal mining operations in Germany. The risk of environmental remediation exists and the Company is in the process of remediating the mines considered to be the most at risk.. 13. Table of Contents. Customer demands and new regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force the Company to incur additional expenses.. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires disclosure of use of “conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and efforts to prevent the use of such minerals. In the semiconductor industry, these minerals are most commonly found in metals. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” metals, the Company cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain necessary metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, the Company may face challenges with its customers and suppliers if it is unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in its products are “conflict free.”. The Company may not be successful protecting its patents and trademarks.. The Company considers its intellectual property, including patents, trade names, and trademarks, to be of significant value to its business as a whole. The Company’s products are manufactured, marketed, and sold under a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses, and other forms of intellectual property, some of which expire or are allowed to lapse at various dates in the future. The Company develops and acquires new intellectual property on an ongoing basis and consider all of its intellectual property to be valuable. The Company's policy is to file applications and obtain patents for the great majority of its novel and innovative new products including product modifications and improvements. Based on the broad scope of its product lines, the Company believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material adverse effect upon its business, financial condition or results of operations; however, multiple losses or expirations could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations."
