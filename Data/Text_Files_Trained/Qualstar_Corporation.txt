[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Our future results of operations are subject to risks and uncertainties over which we have limited control, and which could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations. We are subject to all of the business risks facing manufacturing companies, including business cycles and trends in the general economy, financial market conditions, unpredicted cost variances in raw materials and purchased components, demand variations and volatility, potential loss of key personnel, supply chain disruptions, government legislation and regulation, and natural causes. The following list of risk factors is not all-inclusive. Other factors and unanticipated events could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations. We believe that the most significant potential risk factors that could adversely impact us are the following:. We have had a history of operating losses and we may not sustain profitability.. The Company achieved profitability in the year ended December 31, 2017.  Prior to this year, the Company had a history of operating losses since fiscal year ended June 30, 2004. There is no assurance that management can sustain profitability.. We face intense industry competition, price erosion and product obsolescence, which, in turn, could reduce our operating results.. We operate in an industry that is generally characterized by intense competition and rapid technological change. We believe that the principal bases of competition in our markets are breadth of product line, quality of products, stability, reliability and reputation of the provider, along with cost. Quantity discounts, price erosion, and rapid product obsolescence due to technological improvements are therefore common in our industry as competitors strive to retain or expand market share. Product obsolescence can lead to increases in unsellable inventory that may need to be written off and therefore could reduce our operating results. Similarly, price erosion can reduce our operating results by decreasing our revenues and our gross margins.. Our long-term operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative products, to modify existing products, to respond to technological change, and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements. There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands, which could result in a decrease in our net sales and a loss of market share to our competitors. Historically, we have had write-offs of excess and obsolete inventory which negatively impacted our results of operations. In the future, excess or obsolete inventory may need to be written off, and this in turn could reduce our operating results.. 10. Changes in demand or downturns in the markets we serve could affect our business and operating results.. The industries into which we market and sell our products are cyclical and may experience downturns. These industries also experience volatility, and future volatility as well as downturns, or any failure of these industries to recover from downturns, could materially harm our business and operating results. Likewise, if we have difficulty managing growth in our businesses, it could materially and adversely affect us. In addition, our business and financial position may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions that cause a decline in business and consumer spending in the markets served by our or our customers’ products.. Our operating results may be impaired if demand for either technology declines or fails to develop as we expect.. We will continue to be subject to the risk of a decrease in revenues if demand for our products declines or if rising prices make it more difficult to sell them. If products incorporating other technologies gain comparable or superior market acceptance and competitive price advantage, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely and materially affected unless we successfully develop and market products incorporating the new technology.. Our principal competitors devote greater financial resources to developing, marketing and selling their products. Consequently, we may be unable to maintain or increase our market share.. We face significant competition in developing and selling our products. Rapid and ongoing changes in technology and product standards could quickly render our products less competitive, or even obsolete. We have significantly fewer financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than many of our competitors and these limited resources may impair the operating results of our business in many ways. For example, in the past our competitors have offered wider ranges of products, expanded the geographic scope of their markets, acquired other companies, and developed or acquired proprietary technologies that operate in conjunction with their products.. In the future, our competitors may leverage their greater resources to:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelop, manufacture and market products that are less expensive or technologically superior to ours;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treach a wider array of potential customers through a broader range of marketing and distribution channels;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trespond more quickly to new or changing technologies, customer requirements and standards; or. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduce prices in order to preserve or gain market share.. We believe competitive pressures are likely to continue. We cannot guarantee that our resources will be sufficient to address this competition or that we will manage costs and adopt strategies capable of effectively utilizing our resources. If we are unable to respond to competitive pressures successfully, our prices and profit margins may fall and our market share may decrease.. We rely on indirect sales channels to market and sell our branded storage products and both direct and indirect sales channels to market and sell our branded power solutions products. A loss of or deterioration in our relationship with one or more of our resellers or distributors, or our inability to establish new indirect sales channels to drive growth of our products could negatively affect our operating results.. We sell the majority of our branded storage products to value-added resellers, who in turn sell our products to end users. In some cases, resellers integrate our tape libraries with products of other manufacturers and sell the combined products to their own customers. We sell our branded power solution products both direct to OEM customers (or their contract manufacturers) and to our distribution channel who in turn sell our products to OEM customers. The success of these sales channels is hard to predict, particularly over time, and we have no purchase commitments or long-term orders from them that assure us of any baseline sales through these channels. Several of our resellers and distributors carry competing product lines that they may promote over our products, which may negatively impact our sales. A reseller or distributor might not continue to purchase our products or market them effectively, and each reseller or distributor determines the type and amount of our products that it will purchase from us and the pricing of the products that it sells to their customers. Establishing new indirect sales channels globally is an important part of our strategy to drive growth of our revenue.. 11. Our operating results could be adversely affected by any number of factors including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tA change in competitive strategy that adversely affects a reseller’s or distributor’s willingness or ability to distribute our products;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tReaching fewer customers or losing sales due to ineffective efforts of resellers and distributors;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tReduced margins and increased costs associated with channel sales;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAn inability to gain traction in developing new indirect sales channels for our branded products;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAny financial difficulties of our resellers, authorized distributors or direct OEM customers that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in requirements or programs that allow our products to be sold by third parties to government customers; or. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in product requirements or certification programs that limit our ability for our products to be sold in our established current markets.. We do not have any exclusive agreements with our VARs or distributors who purchase our products on an individual purchase order basis. If we lose important VARs or distributors, or if they reduce their focus on our products or if we are unable to obtain additional VARs, our business could be negatively affected.. If our suppliers fail to meet our component and manufacturing needs, it could delay our production and our product shipments to customers and negatively affect our operations.. Our products comprise many components and subassemblies produced by outside suppliers. We depend greatly on these suppliers for items that are essential to the manufacture of our products, including tape drives, printed circuit boards and integrated circuits. For certain items, we qualify only a single source, which magnifies the risk of shortages and decreases our ability to negotiate with that supplier on the basis of price. From time to time, we have been unable to obtain sufficient components that we have needed due to shortages or quality issues from some of our suppliers. If our suppliers fail to meet our manufacturing needs, it would delay our production and our product shipments to customers and negatively affect our operations.. We also rely on software vendors to develop and support software needed for operation of our automated tape library products and their integration into the user’s computing environment. Accordingly, the continued development and future growth of the market for our tape library products will depend partly upon the ability of these vendors to meet the overall data storage and management needs of tape library purchasers and our ability to maintain relationships with these firms.. The primary suppliers of our N2Power power supplies are located in China. If a manufacturer should be unable to deliver products to us on a timely basis or at all, our power supply business could be adversely affected. Though we have had many years of favorable experience with these suppliers, there can be no assurance that circumstances might not change and compel one or more of these suppliers to curtail or terminate deliveries to us. Moreover, the use of contract manufacturers to provide our power supplies typically requires that we place production orders several months in advance of our expected need for the products. This in turn leads to risks that we may lack sufficient inventory to sell to our customers where our expectations were conservative, or that we may order excess product inventory where our expectations were optimistic. We have in the past, experienced shortages of some parts needed to manufacture our power supplies.. If we fail to develop and introduce new products on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if our products do not contain the features required by the marketplace, we may eventually lose market share and sales to competitors.. The market for our products is characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards. Our future results will depend on our ability to anticipate changes in technology, to develop new and enhanced products on a timely and cost-effective basis, and to introduce, manufacture and achieve market acceptance of these new and enhanced products. With respect to our tape library products in particular, the introduction of new storage technologies or the adoption of an industry standard different from our current product standards could render our existing products obsolete.. 12. Development schedules for high technology products are inherently subject to uncertainty and there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our product development schedules or that our development costs will be within budgeted amounts. If the products or product enhancements developed are not deliverable due to technical problems, quality issues or component shortages, or if such products or product enhancements are not accepted by the marketplace or are unreliable, then our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.. If we fail to protect our intellectual property or if others use our proprietary technology without authorization, our competitive position may suffer.. We rely on copyright protection of our software, firmware and electronic circuits, as well as patent protection for some of our products and product features. We also rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws and various contract rights to protect our proprietary rights. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, however, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our products or technology. As a consequence, these rights may not preclude competitors from developing products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products. In addition, many aspects of our products are not subject to intellectual property protection and therefore can be reproduced by others.. Undetected manufacturing flaws could increase our costs, reduce our revenues and divert resources from our core business needs.. Despite our efforts to revise and update our manufacturing and test processes to address engineering and component changes, we may not be able to control and eliminate manufacturing flaws adequately. These flaws may include undetected software or hardware defects associated with a newly introduced product, a new version of an existing product, or a product that has been integrated into a system or apparatus with the products of other vendors. If we fail to adequately monitor, develop and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes we could experience a rate of product failure that results in substantial shipment delays, warranty costs or damage to our reputation. Product flaws may also consume our limited engineering resources and interrupt our development efforts. Significant product failures would increase our costs and result in the loss of future sales and be harmful to our business.. Much of our business is subject to risks associated with operations in foreign countries.. We generate a significant percentage of our revenue internationally, and we believe that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenues. In addition, our manufacturing of power supply products is performed by contract manufacturers in Asia. We face risks that the countries in which we conduct business, or in which we have customers, suppliers, or contract manufacturers could:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tExperience financial, economic or political instability;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAdopt laws that make the enforcement of our contractual or other legal rights and remedies difficult or uncertain;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tProvide inadequate intellectual property protection for our technology;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tImpose restrictions on the export or import of technology that would affect our ability to obtain supplies from, or sell products into, such countries;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tImpose tariffs, quotas, taxes, other market barriers; or. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tImpose other laws, regulations or policies adversely affecting trade, investment or taxes, including those relating to the repatriation of funds and to withholding taxes.. 13. Other risks and costs associated with international operations include:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCurrency exchange risk, to the extent that exchange rate fluctuations could make our products unaffordable to foreign purchasers or more expensive compared to those of foreign manufacturers;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCompliance with laws and regulations in various regions in which we operate;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tGreater difficulty and longer delays in collecting accounts receivable from international customers; or. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIncreased risk of shipping disruptions particularly in foreign countries experiencing political instability.. Change of board and senior management, and retention of key personnel.. Turnover in key management positions could temporarily harm our financial performance and results of operations. Loss of certain members of our senior management may disrupt operations and relations with key customers and distributors and our operating results could be adversely affected. Our capacity to develop and implement new technologies depends on our ability to employ personnel with highly technical skills. If we cannot attract and retain key technical personnel, our technical expertise may suffer, and our operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, it could be difficult, time consuming and expensive to replace any key management member or other critical personnel and no guarantee exists that we will be able to recruit suitable replacements or assimilate new key management personnel into our organization to achieve our operating objectives.. Intellectual property infringement claims brought against us could result in a substantial liability and significant costs, and as a result, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.. From time to time, we may become subject to claims or inquiries regarding an alleged unauthorized use by us of another party’s intellectual property. While we currently believe the amount of ultimate liability, if any, with respect to any such actions will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, the ultimate outcome of any license discussion or litigation is uncertain. Adverse resolution of any infringement claim could subject us to substantial liabilities and require us to refrain from manufacturing and selling certain products. In addition, the costs incurred in intellectual property litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. As a result, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate unexpectedly from quarter to quarter, which may in turn affect our stock price.. Our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past, and are likely to vary in the future due to the various factors discussed above and others, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tGeneral economic conditions affecting spending and the rates of growth or decline in the markets we serve;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tVariations in product order backlogs, and reductions in the size, delays in the timing, or cancellation of significant customer orders;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe timing of introductions and marketplace acceptance of new or enhanced products by us or our competitors;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tExpansions or reductions in our relationships with distributors, VARs or OEM customers;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tUnprofitable investments in engineering activities, or sales evaluation, testing, and acceptance processes;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tUnforeseen warranty costs that exceed established reserves;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tTiming and levels of our operating expenses; or. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tEmerging new technologies that change the nature of or need for our products.. 14. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be reliable indicators of our future performance. It is likely that in some future period our operating results will not meet your expectations or those of public market analysts. Any unanticipated change in revenues or operating results is likely to cause our stock price to fluctuate since such changes reflect new information available to investors and analysts. New information may cause investors and analysts to revalue our stock and this, in the aggregate, may cause fluctuations in our stock price.. Trading in our stock has historically been limited and our stock price has been volatile, which may affect your ability to sell your shares.. The average trading volume in our stock has been historically low, with little or no trading at all on some days. This, as well as the factors listed below, has caused the price of our stock to be volatile. Consequently, it may be difficult to sell your shares of our stock at the price you paid for them or at a price equal to that quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market. Factors that may cause our stock price to fluctuate in the future include:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tQuarterly variations in operating results, especially if they differ from our previously announced forecasts or forecasts made by analysts;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAnnouncements by us of anticipated future revenues or operating results, or by others concerning us, our competitors, our customers, or our industry;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe introduction of new technology or products by us or our competitors;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tComments about us and the data storage or power supply markets made by industry analysts or on Internet comment sites; or. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in earnings estimates by analysts or changes in accounting policies; in product pricing policies by us or our competitors; or in general economic conditions.. In addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume volatility recently. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many smaller public companies for reasons frequently unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the specific companies. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.. Certain provisions in our charter documents and California law may hinder or prevent a change in control of our company.. Certain provisions of our charter documents could make it difficult for a third party to obtain control of the Company. For example, our articles of incorporation and bylaws require that stockholders must timely inform our corporate secretary before a stockholders' meeting if they wish to nominate directors or submit proposals for shareholder approval and contain provisions that eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors. In addition, subject to the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, our board of directors has the authority, without any action by the shareholders, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights and preferences of such shares. These provisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over its market price and may adversely affect the market price, and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.. Our success depends in part on our CEO, who simultaneously leads other public corporations.. Steven N. Bronson, our Chief Executive Officer and President, simultaneously serves as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Interlink Electronics, Inc. (NASDAQ: LINK) and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of BKF Capital Group, Inc. (OTCMKTS: BKFG). As a result, he divides his time among these companies and does not devote his full business time and attention to Qualstar’s business. Mr. Bronson currently works on average approximately 20 to 30 hours per week for Qualstar. There can be no assurance, however, that the amount of time Mr. Bronson devotes to our Company will not diminish from time to time for limited or extended periods as his other business obligations require a greater portion of his attention. Mr. Bronson is not required to spend a minimum amount of time on Qualstar business. Our continued success depends in part upon the availability and performance of Mr. Bronson, who possesses unique and extensive industry knowledge and experience as well as a deep understanding of our business and strategy. A reduction in Mr. Bronson’s services to Qualstar from their current levels due to his obligations to Interlink Electronics, BKF Capital or other organizations with which he is affiliated could have a disruptive effect, adversely impacting our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy.. 15"
