[1] "Item 1A.  Risk Factors.. <U+FEFF>. Investing in our common units involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report before making an investment decision. Any of the following risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our unitholders. If that occurs, we may not be able to pay distributions on our common units, the trading price of our common units could decline materially, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Although many of our business risks are comparable to those faced by a corporation engaged in a similar business, limited partner interests are inherently different from the capital stock of a corporation and involve additional risks described below. We may experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or as a result of developments occurring in the future. Conditions that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry. <U+FEFF>. We may not have sufficient cash from operations following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including cost reimbursements to our general partner and its affiliates, to pay the minimum quarterly distribution to our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. In order to pay the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.40 per unit per quarter, or $1.60 per unit on an annualized basis, we require available cash of approximately $13.0 million per quarter, or approximately $51.9 million per year, based on the 2% general partner interest and the number of common units and subordinated units outstanding. We may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to pay the minimum quarterly distribution. The amount of cash we can distribute on our units depends on the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which fluctuates from quarter to quarter based on:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe volume of ethanol and other fuels we handle;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe fees associated with the volumes and capacity we handle;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpayments associated with the minimum commitments under our commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttimely payments by Green Plains Trade and other third parties; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprevailing economic conditions.. <U+FEFF>. The cash we have available for distribution also depends on other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe amount of our operating expenses and general and administrative expenses, including reimbursements to our general partner in respect of those expenses;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour capital expenditures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of acquisitions and organic growth projects;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour debt service requirements and other liabilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in our working capital needs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;. 13. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt service requirements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cash reserves established by our general partner; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother business risks affecting our cash levels.. <U+FEFF>. The services we provide under commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade account for a substantial portion of our revenues, which subject us to the business risks of Green Plains Trade and, as a result of its direct ownership by our parent, to the business risks of our parent.. <U+FEFF>. We entered into a storage and throughput agreement and two transportation services agreements with Green Plains Trade in connection with the IPO. Green Plains Trade's obligations under such commercial agreements are guaranteed by our parent. Additionally, we assumed all of BlendStar's terminal services agreements with Green Plains Trade. The services we provide under commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade account for a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Therefore, we are subject to risk of nonpayment or nonperformance by Green Plains Trade and our parent under the commercial agreements. Any event, whether related to our operations or otherwise, that materially and adversely affects Green Plains Trade's or our parent's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may adversely affect our ability to sustain or increase cash distributions to our unitholders. Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to the following operational and business risks of our parent and its subsidiaries (including Green Plains Trade), among others:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe price volatility of corn, natural gas, ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil, crude oil, cattle and vinegar and our parent's ability to manage the spread among the prices for such commodities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour parent's risk management strategies, including hedging transactions that may limit its gain and expose it to other risks;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tGreen Plains Trade's liquidity could be materially and adversely affected if third parties are unable to make payments for their sales;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ethanol industry's dependency on government usage mandates for blending ethanol with gasoline which influences ethanol production and ethanol prices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour parent's indebtedness may limit its ability to obtain additional financing, and our parent may also face difficulties complying with the terms of its debt agreements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcovenants and events of default in our parent's debt agreements could limit its ability to undertake certain types of transactions and adversely affect its liquidity;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour parent has capital needs and planned and unplanned maintenance expenses for which its internally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity may not be adequate;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe dangers inherent in our parent's operations could cause disruptions and could expose our parent to potentially significant losses, costs or liabilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenvironmental risks, incidents and violations that could give rise to material remediation costs, fines and other liabilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour parent may incur significant costs to comply with state and federal environmental, economic, health and safety, energy and other laws, policies and regulations and any changes in those laws, policies and regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta material decrease in the supply of corn available to our parent's ethanol production plants could significantly reduce its production levels;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdemand for ethanol is uncertain and may be affected by changes to federal mandates, public perception, consumer acceptance and overall consumer demand for transportation fuel which would affect our parent's results of operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased federal support of cellulosic ethanol may result in reduced competitiveness of our parent's corn-derived ethanol production;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treplacement technologies under development may result in the obsolescence of corn-derived ethanol or our parent's process systems which would materially impact our parent's operations, cash flow and financial position;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsevere weather, including earthquakes, floods, fire and other natural disasters, could cause damage to our parent's ethanol production plants, disrupt our parent's operations or interrupt the supply of our parent's corn supply for its ethanol production plants and our parent's ability to distribute ethanol;. 14. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour parent could incur substantial costs or disruptions in its business if it cannot obtain or maintain necessary permits and authorizations on favorable terms;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tGreen Plains Trade could incur substantial penalties if it inadvertently traded or trades ethanol with invalid RINs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour parent could incur substantial costs in order to generate or obtain the necessary number of RINs credits in connection with mandates to blend renewable fuels into the petroleum fuels produced and sold in the United States;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour parent may be required to provide remedies for the delivery of off-specification ethanol, distillers grains or corn oil;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompetition in the ethanol industry is intense, and an increase in competition in the areas in which our parent's ethanol is sold, or an increase in foreign ethanol production, could adversely affect our parent's sales and profitability;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour parent's insurance policies do not cover all losses, costs or liabilities that our parent may experience;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour parent could be subject to damages based on claims brought by its customers or lose customers as a result of a failure of its products to meet certain quality specifications;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe loss by our parent of any of its key personnel; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tterrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, threats of war or actual war.. <U+FEFF>. Ethanol production and marketing is a highly competitive business subject to changing market demands and regulatory environments. Any change in our parent's business or financial strategy to meet such demands or requirements may negatively impact our parent's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and, in turn, may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. Ethanol production, storage and transportation, and marketing is highly competitive. In the United States, our parent competes with farmer cooperatives, corn processors and refiners. Our parent is among the five largest producers in the United States that have combined capacity of 7.1 bgy, or 44% of all domestic production as of January 23, 2018. Nearly half of the 212 ethanol plants in the United States are stand-alone entities that produce 5.4 billion gallons, or 34% of all domestic production. If our parent's competitors consolidate or otherwise grow, our parent's business may be significantly and adversely affected. There is also risk of foreign competition. Foreign producers, including Brazil, which is the second largest ethanol producer in the world, may be able to produce ethanol at lower input costs, including costs of feedstock, facilities and personnel, than our parent.. <U+FEFF>. Additionally, our parent considers opportunities presented by third parties related to its assets, including its ethanol production plants. These opportunities may include offers to purchase assets and joint venture propositions. A third-party purchaser may identify alternative service providers and opt for minimum volume commitments or minimum take-or-pay capacity commitments or decide to allow the commercial agreements to expire at the end of the original term. Such third party may also operate the ethanol production plants in a suboptimal manner, increasing the frequency of turnarounds and reducing capacity utilization.. <U+FEFF>. Our parent may change the focus of its operations by developing new facilities, suspending or reducing certain operations, modifying or closing facilities or terminating operations. Changes may be considered to meet market demands, to satisfy regulatory requirements or environmental and safety objectives, to improve operational efficiency or for other reasons. Our parent actively manages its assets and operations, and, therefore, changes of some nature, possibly material to its business relationship with us, are likely to occur at some point in the future. No such changes will be subject to our consent.. <U+FEFF>. We have no control over our parent or Green Plains Trade, which are currently our primary source of revenue and primary customers, and our parent and Green Plains Trade may elect to pursue a business strategy that does not favor us and our business. A change in our parent's business or financial strategy, contractual obligations or risk profile may negatively impact its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or creditworthiness. In turn, our cash flows from our commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade and, therefore, our ability to sustain or increase cash distributions to our unitholders may be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, our creditworthiness may be adversely affected by a decline in our parent's creditworthiness, increasing our borrowing costs or hindering our ability to access the capital markets.. 15. Table of Contents. Conflicts of interest may arise between our general partner and its affiliates, including our parent and Green Plains Trade, on the one hand, and us and our unitholders, on the other hand. Green Plains Trade may suspend, reduce or terminate its obligations under the commercial agreements with us in certain circumstances, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. Our financial performance is substantially dependent on our parent's ethanol production plants.. <U+FEFF>. We believe that a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future will be derived from operations supporting our parent's ethanol production plants. Any event that renders these ethanol production plants temporarily or permanently unavailable or that temporarily or permanently reduces production rates at any of these ethanol production plants could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. Green Plains Trade may suspend, reduce or terminate its obligations under the commercial agreements with us in certain circumstances.. <U+FEFF>. All of our commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade include provisions that permit Green Plains Trade to suspend, reduce or terminate its obligations under the agreements if certain events occur. Under all of our commercial agreements, these events include a material breach of such agreements by us, the occurrence of certain force majeure events that would prevent Green Plains Trade or us from performing our respective obligations under the applicable commercial agreement and the minimum commitment, if any, not being available to Green Plains Trade for reasons outside of its control.. <U+FEFF>. As defined in each of our commercial agreements, force majeure events include any acts or occurrences that prevent services from being performed under the applicable commercial agreement, such as:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfederal, state, county, or municipal orders, rules, legislation, or regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacts of God, including fires, floods, storms, earthquakes or other severe weather events;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompliance with orders of courts or any governmental authorities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texplosions, wars, terrorist acts or riots;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstrikes, lockouts or other industrial disturbances; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tevents or circumstances similar to those above (including disruption of service provided by third parties) that prevent a party's ability to perform its obligations under the agreement, to the extent that such events or circumstances are beyond the party's reasonable control.. <U+FEFF>. Accordingly, under the commercial agreements, there are a broad range of events that could result in our no longer being required to store, throughput or transport Green Plains Trade's minimum commitments and Green Plains Trade no longer being required to pay the full amount of fees that would have been associated with its minimum commitments. Additionally, we have no control over the business decisions of our parent or Green Plains Trade, and conflicts of interest may arise between our general partner and its affiliates, including our parent and Green Plains Trade, on the one hand, and us and our unitholders, on the other hand. Neither our parent nor Green Plains Trade is required to pursue a business strategy that favors us or utilizes our assets. However, they could elect to decrease ethanol production or shutdown or reconfigure an ethanol production plant. Furthermore, a single event or business decision relating to one of our parent's ethanol production plants could have an impact on the commercial agreements with us. These actions, as well the other activities described above, could result in a reduction or suspension of Green Plains Trade's obligations under the commercial agreements. Any such reduction or suspension would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and ability to make distributions to our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. Neither our parent nor Green Plains Trade is obligated to use our services with respect to volumes or volumetric capacity of ethanol or other fuels in excess of the applicable minimum commitment under the respective commercial agreements. Furthermore, we may be unable to renew or extend our commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade or renew them on favorable terms.. <U+FEFF>. Our ability to distribute the minimum quarterly distribution to our unitholders will be adversely affected if we do not receive, store, transfer, transport or deliver additional volumes or use volumetric capacity for Green Plains Trade or other third parties at our ethanol storage facilities, at our fuel terminal facilities or on our railcars.. <U+FEFF>. 16. Table of Contents. In addition, the remaining term of Green Plains Trade's obligations under each agreement extends for approximately 7.5 years in the case of the storage and throughput agreement and the rail transportation services agreement, two years in the case of the terminal services agreements that provide for minimum commitments, and five months in the case of the trucking transportation agreement. If, at the end of the remaining primary term, our parent and Green Plains Trade elect not to extend these agreements and, as a result, fail to use our assets and we are unable to generate additional revenues from third parties, our ability to pay cash distributions to our unitholders will be reduced. Furthermore, any renewal of the commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade may not be on favorable commercial terms. For example, depending on prevailing market conditions at the time of contract renewal, Green Plains Trade may desire to enter into contracts under different fee arrangements. To the extent we are unable to renew the commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade on terms that are favorable to us, our revenue and cash flows could decline and our ability to pay cash distributions to our unitholders could be materially and adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. Green Plains Trade's minimum take-or-pay capacity commitment will be reduced proportionately as our railcar leases expire if we do not enter into new rail transportation services agreements.. <U+FEFF>. We lease our fleet of railcars from several lessors pursuant to lease agreements with remaining terms ranging from less than one year to approximately five years with a weighted average remaining term of 3.8 years. As our railcar lease agreements expire, the respective volumetric capacity of those expired leases will no longer be subject to the rail transportation services agreement, and Green Plains Trade's minimum take-or-pay capacity commitment will be reduced proportionately. Of our current leased railcar fleet, 5.7%,  13.5%,  13.9% and 15.3% of the railcar volumetric capacity have terms that expire in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, or approximately 48.4% of our total current railcar volumetric capacity during that time frame. If at the end of the terms under the lease agreements, we do not enter into new commercial arrangements with respect to rail transportation services, our revenues and cash flows could decline and our ability to pay cash distributions to our unitholders could be materially and adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. Railcars used to transport ethanol and other fuels may need to be retrofitted or replaced to meet new rail safety standards.. <U+FEFF>. The U.S. ethanol industry has long relied on railroads to deliver its product to market. We currently lease approximately 3,500 railcars. On May 1, 2015, the DOT, through PHMSA and FRA, and in coordination with Transport Canada, announced the final rule, \"Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operational Controls for High-Hazard Flammable Trains\". The rule calls for an enhanced tank car standard known as the DOT specification 117, or DOT-117 tank car, and establishes a schedule for retrofitting or replacing older tank cars carrying crude oil and ethanol. The rule also establishes new braking standards that are intended to reduce the severity of accidents and the so-called \"pile-up effect\". Under prescribed circumstances, new operational protocols apply including reduced speed, routing requirements and local government notifications. In addition, persons that offer hazardous material for transportation must develop more accurate classification protocols. These regulations will result in upgrades or replacements of our railcars, and may have an adverse effect on our operations as lease costs for railcars may increase over the long term. Our railcars are also subject to federally-mandated tank car requalification, which requires inspection, repairs and upgrades to our current railcar fleet every ten years. Due to these regulatory standards, as well as any potential modifications that may be issued in the future, existing railcars could be out of service for a period of time while such upgrades are made, tightening supply in an industry that is highly dependent on such railcars to transport its product. Since we cannot charge our customers for railcars that are out of service, a significant increase in out of service railcars could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions.. <U+FEFF>. Rail logistical problems may delay the delivery of our customers' products.. <U+FEFF>. Weather related incidents, particularly snow and flooding, can cause increased transit times and result in rail congestion at destinations. In the past, rail delays have caused some ethanol plants to slow or suspend production. Due to the location of our parent's ethanol production plants, we have not historically been materially affected by these logistical problems. If railroad performance is inadequate, we may face delays in shipping railcars to and from our parent's ethanol production plants, which may affect our ability to transport product. Rail logistical problems due to circumstances outside of the control or us or our customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions.. <U+FEFF>. 17. Table of Contents. Government mandates affecting ethanol could change and impact the ethanol market.. <U+FEFF>. Under the provisions of the EISA, Congress established a mandate setting the minimum volume of renewable fuels that must be blended with gasoline under the RFS II, which affects the domestic market for ethanol. The EPA has the authority to waive the requirements, in whole or in part, if there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or the requirement severely harms the economy or the environment. After 2022, volumes shall be determined by the EPA in coordination with the Secretaries of Energy and Agriculture, taking into account such factors as impact on environment, energy security, future rates of production, cost to consumers, infrastructure, and other factors such as impact on commodity prices, job creation, rural economic development, or impact on food prices.. <U+FEFF>. Our parent's operations could be adversely impacted by legislation or EPA actions, as set forth below or otherwise, that may reduce the RFS II mandate. Similarly, should federal mandates regarding oxygenated gasoline be repealed, the market for domestic ethanol could be adversely impacted. Economic incentives to blend based on the relative value of gasoline versus ethanol, taking into consideration the octane value of ethanol, environmental requirements and the RFS II mandate, may affect future demand. A significant increase in supply beyond the RFS II mandate could have an adverse impact on ethanol prices. Moreover, changes to RFS II could negatively impact the price of ethanol or cause imported sugarcane ethanol to become more economical than domestic ethanol.. <U+FEFF>. On July 5, 2017, the EPA proposed maintaining the RVOs for conventional ethanol at 15.0 billion gallons while lowering the volume obligations for advanced alternatives, reducing the overall biofuel target to 19.24 billion gallons for 2018. On September 26, 2017, the EPA issued a Notice of Data Availability for comment, proposing to further reduce the 2018 advanced biofuel volume requirement by 315 mmg, to 3.77 billion gallons, and the total renewable fuel requirement to 18.77 billion gallons, leaving conventional ethanol at 15.0 billion gallons. According to RFS II, if mandatory renewable fuel volumes are reduced by at least 20% for two consecutive years, the EPA is required to modify, or reset, statutory volumes through 2022. Since 2018 is the first year the total proposed RVOs are more than 20% below statutory levels, the EPA Administrator directed his staff to initiate the required technical analysis to perform any future reset consistent with the reset rules. If 2019 RVOs are also more than 20% below statutory levels, the RVO reset will be triggered under RFS II and the EPA will be required to modify statutory volumes through 2022 within one year of the trigger event, based on the same factors used to set the RVOs post-2022.. <U+FEFF>. The U.S. Federal District Court for the D.C. Circuit ruled on July 28, 2017, in favor of the Americans for Clean Energy and its petitioners against the EPA related to its decision to lower the 2016 volume requirements. The Court concluded the EPA erred in how it interpreted the \"inadequate domestic supply\" waiver provision of RFS II, which authorizes the EPA to consider supply-side factors affecting the volume of renewable fuel available to refiners, blenders, and importers to meet the statutory volume requirements. The waiver provision does not allow the EPA to consider the volume of renewable fuel available to consumers or the demand-side constraints that affect the consumption of renewable fuel by consumers. As a result, the Court vacated the EPA's decision to reduce the total renewable fuel volume requirements for 2016 through its waiver authority, which the EPA is expected to address. We believe this decision will benefit the industry overall, with the EPA's waiver analysis now limited to supply considerations only, and expect the primary impact will be on the RINs market.. <U+FEFF>. On October 19, 2017, the EPA Administrator reiterated his commitment to the text and spirit of the RFS II. In a letter to seven Senators from the Midwestern states, among other topics, he stated the EPA is actively exploring its authority to issue an RVP waiver and will not be pursuing action on RINs involving ethanol exports. Moreover, on November 22, 2017, the EPA issued a Notice of Denial of Petitions for rulemaking to change the RFS point of obligation which resulted in the EPA confirming the point of obligation will not change.. <U+FEFF>. Valero Energy and refining trade group American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) have challenged the EPA's handling of the U.S. biofuel mandate in separate actions on January 26, 2018. AFPM is asking the D.C. U.S. Court of Appeals to review the EPA's November 2017 decision to reject proposed changes to the structure of the RFS, including moving the point of obligation from refiners and importers of fuel to fuel blenders. Valero filed two petitions with the same court, one seeking review of the annual Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) rule set by the EPA for 2018 and 2019, which dictates the volumes of renewable fuels to be blended in the coming years, and a second arguing against the EPA's December 2017 assertion that the agency has fulfilled its duty to periodically review the RFS as directed by statute.. <U+FEFF>. Future demand may be influenced by economic incentives to blend based on the relative value of gasoline versus ethanol, taking into consideration the octane value of ethanol, environmental requirements and the RFS II mandate. A significant increase in supply beyond the RFS II mandate could have an adverse impact on ethanol prices. Moreover, any changes to RFS II originating from issues associated with the market price of RINs could negatively impact the demand for ethanol, discretionary blending of ethanol and/or the price of ethanol.. 18. Table of Contents. <U+FEFF>. Flexible-fuel vehicles, which are designed to run on a mixture of fuels such as E85, receive preferential treatment to meet corporate average fuel economy standards in the form of CAFE credits. Flexible-fuel vehicle credits have been decreasing since 2014 and will be completely phased out by 2020. Absent CAFE preferences, auto manufacturers may not be willing to build flexible-fuel vehicles, reducing the growth of E85 markets and resulting in lower ethanol prices.. <U+FEFF>. To the extent federal or state laws or regulations are modified, the demand for ethanol may be reduced, which could negatively and materially affect our financial performance.. <U+FEFF>. We may not be able to increase our third-party revenues due to competition and other factors, which could limit our ability to grow and could increase our dependence on our parent.. <U+FEFF>. Part of our growth strategy includes diversifying our customer base by acquiring or developing new assets independently from our parent. Our ability to increase our third-party revenue is subject to numerous factors beyond our control, including competition from third parties and the extent to which we lack available capacity when third parties require it.. <U+FEFF>. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to attract any material third-party service opportunities. Our efforts to attract new unaffiliated customers may be adversely affected by (1) our relationship with our parent, (2) our desire to provide services pursuant to fee-based contracts, (3) our parent's operational requirements at its ethanol production plants and (4) our expectation that our parent will continue to utilize substantially all of the available capacity of our assets. Our potential customers may prefer to obtain services under other forms of contractual arrangements under which we would be required to assume direct commodity exposure. In addition, we need to establish a reputation among our potential customer base for providing high-quality service in order to successfully attract unaffiliated third parties.. <U+FEFF>. Our future growth could be limited if we are unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, or if the acquisitions we make reduce, rather than increase, our cash flows.. <U+FEFF>. A portion of our strategy to grow our business and increase distributions to our unitholders is dependent on our ability to acquire businesses or assets that increase our cash flows. The acquisition component of our growth strategy is based, in large part, on our expectation of ongoing divestitures of complementary assets by industry participants, including in conjunction with acquisitions by our parent. A material decrease in such divestitures would limit our opportunities for future acquisitions and could adversely affect our ability to grow our operations and increase cash distributions to our unitholders. If we are unable to make acquisitions from third parties because we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates, negotiate acceptable purchase contracts, obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or we are outbid by competitors, our future growth and ability to increase distributions will be limited. Furthermore, even if we do consummate acquisitions that we believe will be accretive, they may in fact result in a decrease in cash flows. Any acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinaccurate assumptions about revenues and costs, including synergies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tan inability to integrate successfully the businesses or assets we acquire;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe assumption of unknown liabilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinaccurate assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt financing;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic areas; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcustomer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses.. <U+FEFF>. If we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and our unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources.. <U+FEFF>. Our right of first offer to acquire any of our parent's new ethanol storage assets, fuel terminal facilities or ethanol or transportation fuel assets is subject to risks and uncertainty, and we may ultimately decide not to acquire any of those assets.. <U+FEFF>. Under our omnibus agreement, we are granted a five-year right of first offer from the date of the IPO on any (1) ethanol storage or terminal assets that our parent may acquire or construct in the future, (2) fuel storage or terminal facilities that our. 19. Table of Contents. parent may acquire or construct in the future, and (3) ethanol and fuel transportation assets that our parent currently owns or may acquire in the future, before selling or transferring any of those assets to any third party. We do not have a current agreement with our parent to purchase any currently owned assets covered by our right of first offer. The consummation and timing of any future acquisitions of these assets will depend upon, among other things, our parent's willingness to sell such assets, our ability to negotiate acceptable purchase agreements and commercial agreements with respect to the assets and our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. We can offer no assurance that we will be able to successfully consummate any future acquisitions pursuant to our right of first offer. In addition, certain of the assets may require substantial capital expenditures in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulatory requirements or otherwise make them suitable for our commercial needs. For these or a variety of other reasons, we may decide not to exercise our right of first offer if and when any assets are offered for sale. Our decision will not be subject to unitholder approval.. <U+FEFF>. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions of assets from our parent through our right of first offer. If we are unable to do so, our future growth and ability to increase distributions may be limited. Even if we do consummate such acquisitions that we believe will be accretive, they may in fact result in a decrease in our distributable cash flow per unit as a result of incorrect assumptions, unforeseen consequences, or other external events beyond our control.. <U+FEFF>. Any inability to maintain required regulatory permits may impede or completely prohibit our parent's and our operations. Additionally, any change in environmental and safety regulations, or violations thereof, may impede our parent's and our ability to operate our respective businesses successfully.. <U+FEFF>. Our and our parent's operations are subject to extensive air, water and other environmental regulation. Our parent has had to obtain a number of environmental permits to construct and operate its ethanol production plants. Ethanol production involves the emission of various airborne pollutants, including particulate, carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, hazardous air pollutants and volatile organic compounds. In addition, the governing state agencies could impose conditions or other restrictions in the permits that are detrimental to our parent and us or which increase our parent's costs above those required for profitable operations. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.. <U+FEFF>. Environmental laws and regulations, both at the federal and state level, are subject to change and changes can be made retroactively. It is possible that more stringent federal or state environmental rules or regulations could be adopted, which could increase our operating costs and expenses. Consequently, even if we and our parent have the proper permits at the present time, each of us may be required to invest or spend considerable resources to comply with future environmental regulations. Furthermore, ongoing operations are governed by OSHA. OSHA regulations may change in a way that increases each of our costs of operations. If any of these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse impact on our operations, cash flows and financial position.. <U+FEFF>. Part of our business is regulated by environmental laws and regulations governing the labeling, use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials. Because we use and handle hazardous substances in our businesses, changes in environmental requirements or an unanticipated significant adverse environmental event could have an adverse effect on our business. While we strive to ensure compliance, we cannot assure you that we have been, or will at all times be, in compliance with all environmental requirements, or that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with these requirements. Private parties, including current and former employees, could bring personal injury or other claims against us due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances used, stored or disposed of by us, or contained in its products. We are also exposed to residual risk because some of our facilities and land may have environmental liabilities arising from their prior use. In addition, changes to environmental regulations may require us to modify existing facilities and could significantly increase the cost of those operations.. <U+FEFF>. Our revolving credit facility includes restrictions that may limit our ability to finance future operations, meet our capital needs or expand our business.. <U+FEFF>. We are dependent upon the earnings and cash flow generated by our operations in order to meet our debt service obligations and to allow us to pay cash distributions to our unitholders. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our revolving credit facility or in any future financing agreements could restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue our business activities, which may, in turn, limit our ability to pay cash distributions to our unitholders. For example, our revolving credit facility restricts our ability to, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake certain cash distributions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur certain indebtedness;. 20. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcreate certain liens;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake certain investments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmerge or sell certain of our assets; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpand the nature of our business.. <U+FEFF>. Furthermore, our revolving credit facility contains covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios.. <U+FEFF>. The provisions of our revolving credit facility may affect our ability to obtain future financing and pursue attractive business opportunities and our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions. In addition, a failure to comply with the provisions of our revolving credit facility could result in an event of default that could enable our lenders, subject to the terms and conditions of our revolving credit facility, to declare the outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable and/or to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such debt. If there is a default or event of default under our debt the payment of our debt is accelerated, defaults under our other debt instruments, if any, may be triggered, and our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full. Therefore, the holders of our units could experience a partial or total loss of their investment.. <U+FEFF>. Debt we incur in the future may limit our flexibility to obtain financing and to pursue other business opportunities.. <U+FEFF>. Our future level of debt could have important consequences to us, including, but not limited to, the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures or other purposes may be impaired, or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour funds available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions to our unitholders will be reduced by that portion of our cash flow required to service our debt;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions may be limited.. <U+FEFF>. Our ability to service our debt depends upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which is affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service any future debt, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, organic growth projects, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets or issuing equity. We may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all.. <U+FEFF>. Our parent is required to comply with a number of covenants under its existing loan agreements that could hinder our ability to grow our business, pay cash distributions and maintain our credit profile. Our ability to obtain credit in the future may also be affected by our parent's credit ratings, our own credit profile and the environment for access to capital for master limited partnerships.. <U+FEFF>. Our parent must devote a portion of its cash flows from operating activities to service its indebtedness. A higher level of indebtedness at our parent in the future increases the risk that its subsidiary, Green Plains Trade, may default on its obligations under the commercial agreements with us. Despite its current debt levels, our parent and its subsidiaries may incur additional debt in the future, including secured debt. Our parent and certain of its subsidiaries (including Green Plains Trade) are restricted under the terms of its debt from incurring various types of additional debt, pledging assets, and recapitalizing its debt. In addition, a number of other actions, whether restricted or non-restricted by the debt terms, could diminish our ability to make payments thereunder.. <U+FEFF>. Our parent's existing and future debt arrangements, as applicable, may limit its ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures above certain limits, pay dividends or distributions, merge or consolidate, or dispose of substantially all of its assets, and may directly or indirectly impact our operations in a similar manner. Our parent or its subsidiaries are also required to maintain specified financial ratios, including term debt to total term capitalization, minimum cash flow coverage, minimum working capital and minimum net worth. Its term loan agreement requires it to utilize a portion of any excess cash flow generated by operations to prepay the respective term debt. A breach of any of these covenants or requirements could result in a default under its loan agreements. If any of its subsidiaries default, and if such default is not cured or waived, our parent's lenders could, among other things, accelerate their debt and declare that debt immediately due and payable. If this occurs, our parent may not be able to repay such debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance. Even if new financing is available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable. No assurance can be given. 21. Table of Contents. that the future operating results of our parent's subsidiaries will be sufficient to achieve compliance with such covenants and requirements, or in the event of a default, to remedy such default.. <U+FEFF>. Furthermore, our parent granted liens on substantially all of its assets as part of the terms of its outstanding indebtedness. Thus, in the event that our parent were to default under certain of its debt obligations, there is a risk that our parent's creditors would assert claims against us with respect to our contracts with Green Plains Trade, our parent's assets, and Green Plains Trade's ethanol and other product we throughput and handle during the litigation of their claims. The defense of any such claims could be costly and could materially impact our financial condition, even absent any adverse determination. In the event these claims were successful, Green Plains Trade's ability to meet its obligations under our commercial agreements and our ability to make distributions and finance our operations could be materially adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. If rating agencies downgrade our parent's credit rating, or if disruptions in credit markets were to occur, the cost of debt under its existing financing arrangements, as well as future financing arrangements and borrowings, could increase. Access to capital markets could become unavailable or may only be available under less favorable terms. A downgrade of our parent's credit ratings may also affect its ability to trade with various commercial counterparties, including us, or cause its counterparties, including us, to require other forms of credit support. In addition, although we do not have any indebtedness rated by any credit rating agency, we may have rated debt in the future. Credit rating agencies will likely consider our parent's debt ratings when assigning ours because of the significant commercial relationship between our parent and us, and our reliance on our parent for a substantial portion of our revenues. If one or more credit rating agencies were to downgrade the outstanding indebtedness of our parent, we could experience an increase in our borrowing costs or difficulty accessing the capital markets. Such a development could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. We have exposure to increases in interest rates.. <U+FEFF>. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility are expected to bear interest at LIBOR, plus an applicable margin. As a result, if we make any borrowings in the  future, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our unitholders could be materially adversely affected by significant increases in interest rates.. <U+FEFF>. Additionally, as with other yield-oriented securities, our unit price is impacted by the level of our cash distributions and implied distribution yield. The distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank related yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our units, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our unit price and our ability to issue additional equity, to incur debt to expand or for other purposes or to pay cash distributions at our intended levels.. <U+FEFF>. Our assets and operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and safety that may require substantial expenditures.. <U+FEFF>. Our assets and operations involve the receipt, storage, transfer, transportation and delivery of ethanol and other fuels, which is subject to increasingly stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing operational safety and the discharge of materials into the environment. Our business involves the risk that ethanol and other fuels may gradually or suddenly be released into the environment. To the extent not covered by insurance or an indemnity, responding to the release of regulated substances, including releases caused by third parties, into the environment may cause us to incur potentially material expenditures related to response actions, government penalties, natural resources damages, personal injury or property damage claims from third parties and business interruption.. <U+FEFF>. Our operations are also subject to increasingly strict federal, state and local laws and regulations related to protection of the environment that require us to comply with various safety requirements regarding the design, installation, testing, construction and operational management of our assets. Compliance with such laws and regulations may cause us to incur potentially material capital expenditures associated with the construction, maintenance and upgrading of equipment and facilities.. <U+FEFF>. We could incur potentially significant additional expenses should we determine that any of our assets are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these or any other environmental or safety-related regulations could result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial liabilities and the issuance of injunctions that may subject us to additional operational constraints. Any such penalties or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions.. 22. Table of Contents. <U+FEFF>. Compliance with evolving environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, particularly those related to climate change, may be costly.. <U+FEFF>. Our parent's ethanol production plants emit carbon dioxide as a by-product of the ethanol production process. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions. On February 3, 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on RFS II. Our parent believes that these final regulations grandfather its ethanol production plants at their current authorized capacity, though expansion of its ethanol production plants may need to meet a threshold of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement for the ethanol over current capacity to be eligible for the RFS II mandate.. <U+FEFF>. Separately, CARB has adopted a LCFS, requiring a 10% reduction in average carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel transportation fuels from 2010 to 2020. After a series of rulings that temporarily prevented CARB from enforcing these regulations, the State of California Office of Administrative Law approved the LCFS on November 26, 2012, and revised LCFS regulations took effect in January 2013. An ILUC component is included in this lifecycle GHG emissions calculation which may have an adverse impact on the market for corn-based ethanol in California.. <U+FEFF>. These federal and state regulations may require our parent to apply for additional permits for its ethanol plants. In order to expand capacity at its ethanol production plants, our parent may have to apply for additional permits, achieve EPA \"efficient producer\" status under the pathway petition program, install advanced technology, or reduce drying of certain amounts of distillers grains. Our parent may also be required to install carbon dioxide mitigation equipment or take other steps unknown to our parent at this time in order to comply with other future law or regulation. Compliance with future law or regulation of carbon dioxide, or if our parent chooses to expand capacity at certain of its ethanol production plants, compliance with then-current regulation of carbon dioxide, could be costly and may prevent our parent from operating its ethanol production plants as profitably, which may have an adverse impact on their operations, cash flows and financial position.. <U+FEFF>. These developments could have an indirect adverse effect on our business if our parent's operations are adversely affected due to increased regulation of our parent's facilities or reduced demand for ethanol, and a direct adverse effect on our business from increased regulation at our fuel terminal facilities.. <U+FEFF>. Our business is impacted by environmental risks inherent in our operations.. <U+FEFF>. The operation of ethanol storage assets and ethanol transportation is inherently subject to the risks of spills, discharges or other inadvertent releases of ethanol and other hazardous substances. If any of these events have previously occurred or occur in the future in connection with any of our parent's operations or our operations, we could be liable for costs and penalties associated with the remediation of such events under federal, state and local environmental laws or the common law. We may also be liable for personal injury or property damage claims from third parties alleging contamination from spills or releases from our assets or our operations. Even if we are insured or indemnified against such risks, we may be responsible for costs or penalties to the extent our insurers or indemnitors do not fulfill their obligations to us. The payment of such costs or penalties could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and ability to make distributions to our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. Our business activities are subject to regulation by multiple federal, state, and local governmental agencies.. <U+FEFF>. Our projected operating costs reflect the recurring costs resulting from compliance with these regulations, and we do not anticipate material expenditures in excess of these amounts in the absence of future acquisitions, or changes in regulation, or discovery of existing but unknown compliance issues. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the ethanol industry are regularly considered by Congress, as well as by state legislatures and federal and state regulatory commissions and agencies and courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective or the magnitude of the impact changes in laws and regulations may have on our business; however, additions or enhancements to the regulatory burden on our industry generally increase the cost of doing business and affect our profitability.. <U+FEFF>. Replacement technologies could make corn-based ethanol or our process technology obsolete.. <U+FEFF>. Ethanol is primarily an additive and oxygenate for blended gasoline. Although use of oxygenates is currently mandated, there is always the possibility that a preferred alternative product will emerge and impact the current market. Critics of ethanol blends argue that ethanol decreases fuel economy, causes corrosion of ferrous components and damages fuel pumps. Any alternative oxygenate product would likely be a form of alcohol (like ethanol) or ether (like MTBE). Prior to federal. 23. Table of Contents. restrictions and ethanol mandates, MTBE was the dominant oxygenate. It is possible that other ether products could enter the market and prove to be environmentally or economically superior to ethanol. It is also possible that alternative biofuel alcohols such as methanol and butanol could evolve into ethanol replacement products.. <U+FEFF>. Research is currently underway to develop other products that could directly compete with ethanol and may have more potential advantages than ethanol. Such products could have a competitive advantage over ethanol, making it more difficult for our parent to market its ethanol, which could reduce our ability to generate revenue and profits.. New ethanol process technologies may emerge that require less energy per gallon produced. The development of such process technologies would result in lower ethanol production costs. Our parent's process technologies may become outdated and obsolete, placing it at a competitive disadvantage against competitors in the industry. The development of replacement technologies may have a material adverse effect on our parent's, and consequently our, operations, cash flows and financial position.. <U+FEFF>. Future demand for ethanol is uncertain and changes in federal mandates, public perception, consumer acceptance and overall consumer demand for transportation fuel could affect demand.. <U+FEFF>. Although many trade groups, academics and governmental agencies have supported ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment, others have criticized ethanol production as consuming considerably more energy and emitting more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and potentially depleting water resources. Some studies have suggested that corn-based ethanol is less efficient than ethanol produced from switchgrass or wheat grain and that it negatively impacts consumers by causing prices for dairy, meat and other foodstuffs from livestock that consume corn to increase. Additionally, ethanol critics contend that corn supplies are redirected from international food markets to domestic fuel markets. If negative views of corn-based ethanol production gain acceptance, support for existing measures promoting use and domestic production of corn-based ethanol could decline, leading to reduction or repeal of federal mandates, which would adversely affect the demand for ethanol. These views could also negatively impact public perception of the ethanol industry and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel.. <U+FEFF>. Beyond the federal mandates, there are limited markets for ethanol. Discretionary blending and E85 blending are important secondary markets. Discretionary blending is often determined by the price of ethanol versus the price of gasoline. In periods when discretionary blending is financially unattractive, the demand for ethanol may be reduced. Also, the demand for ethanol is affected by the overall demand for transportation fuel, which declined from 2007 until early 2013 but has been increasing modestly since then. Demand for transportation fuel is affected by the number of miles traveled by consumers and the fuel economy of vehicles. Market acceptance of E15 may partially offset the effects of decreases in transportation fuel demand. A reduction in the demand for the products we store and ship may depress the value of these products, erode margins, and reduce the ability to generate revenue or to operate profitably. Consumer acceptance of E15 and E85 fuels is one factor that may be needed before ethanol can achieve any significant growth in market share.. <U+FEFF>. Increased federal support of cellulosic ethanol may increase competition among corn-derived ethanol producers.. <U+FEFF>. Legislation, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and EISA, provides numerous funding opportunities supporting cellulosic ethanol production. In addition, RFS II mandates an increasing level of biofuel production that is not derived from corn. Federal policies suggest a long-term political preference for cellulosic processing using feedstocks such as switch grass, silage, wood chips or other forms of biomass. Cellulosic ethanol may be viewed more favorably since the feedstock is not diverted from food production. In addition, cellulosic ethanol may have a smaller carbon footprint because the feedstock does not require energy-intensive fertilizers or industrial production processes. Several cellulosic ethanol plants are currently under development. While these have had limited success to date, as research and development programs persist, there is risk that cellulosic ethanol could displace corn ethanol. In addition, any replacement of federal mandates from corn-based to cellulosic-based ethanol production may reduce our parent's, and consequently our, profitability.. <U+FEFF>. Our parent's ethanol production plants, where the majority of our ethanol storage facilities are located, are designed as single-feedstock facilities and would require significant additional investment to convert to the production of cellulosic ethanol. Additionally, our parent's ethanol production plants are strategically located in high-yield, low-cost corn production areas. At present, there is limited supply of alternative feedstocks near our parent's facilities. As a result, the adoption of cellulosic ethanol and its use as the preferred form of ethanol could have a significant adverse impact on our parent's, and consequently our, business.. <U+FEFF>. 24. Table of Contents. Our insurance policies do not cover all losses, costs or liabilities that we may experience, and insurance companies that currently insure companies in the energy industry may cease to do so or substantially increase premiums.. <U+FEFF>. We are insured under the property, liability and business interruption policies of our parent, subject to the deductibles and limits under those policies. Our parent has acquired insurance that we and our parent believe to be adequate to prevent loss from material foreseeable risks. However, events may occur for which no insurance is available or for which insurance is not available on terms that are acceptable to our parent. Loss from such an event, such as, but not limited to war, riot, terrorism or other risks, may not be insured and such a loss may have a material adverse effect on our and our parent's operations, cash flows and financial position.. <U+FEFF>. Certain of our parent's ethanol production plants and our related storage tanks, as well as certain of our fuel terminal facilities are located within recognized seismic and flood zones. We believe that the design of these facilities have been modified to fortify them to meet structural requirements for those regions of the country. Our parent has also obtained additional insurance coverage specific to earthquake and flood risks for the applicable plants and fuel terminals. However, there is no assurance that any such facility would remain in operation if a seismic or flood event were to occur.. <U+FEFF>. Additionally, our ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be adversely affected by conditions in the insurance market over which we have no control. In addition, if we experience insurable events, our annual premiums could increase further or insurance may not be available at all. If significant changes in the number or financial solvency of insurance underwriters for the ethanol industry occur, we may be unable to obtain and maintain adequate insurance at a reasonable cost. We cannot assure our unitholders that we will be able to renew our insurance coverage on acceptable terms, if at all, or that we will be able to arrange for adequate alternative coverage in the event of non-renewal. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance, the failure by one or more insurers to honor its commitments for an insured event or the loss of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. The loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate.. <U+FEFF>. We depend on the leadership, involvement and services of a relatively small group of our general partner's key management personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers and key technical and commercial personnel. The services of these individuals may not be available to us in the future. We may not be able to find acceptable replacements with comparable skills and experience. Accordingly, the loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business.. <U+FEFF>. Additionally, our success depends, in part, on our parent's ability to attract and retain competent personnel. For each of our parent's ethanol production plants, qualified managers, engineers, operations and other personnel must be hired. Our parent may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel. If our parent is unable to hire and retain productive and competent personnel, the amount of ethanol our parent produces may decrease and our parent may not be able to efficiently operate its ethanol production plants and execute its business strategy, which could negatively impact the volumes of ethanol handled by us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. We do not have any employees and rely solely on employees of our parent and its affiliates.. <U+FEFF>. We do not have any employees and rely on employees of our parent and its affiliates, including our parent. Affiliates of our parent conduct businesses and activities of their own in which we have no economic interest. As a result, there could be material competition for the time and efforts of the employees who provide services to us and to our parent and its affiliates. If the employees of our parent and its affiliates do not devote sufficient attention to the operation of our business, our financial results may suffer and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders may be reduced.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, we have entered into service agreements with unaffiliated third-parties to provide railcar unloading and terminal services for several of our terminal facilities. Under these service agreements,  the third parties are responsible for providing the personnel necessary for the performance of various railcar unloading and terminal services.  The third parties are considered independent contractors and none of their employees or contractors are considered an employee, representative or agent of us. Failure to maintain or renew these agreements could negatively affect our operational and financial results and may increase operating expenses at our terminal facilities.. <U+FEFF>. 25. Table of Contents. We could be adversely affected by terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, threats of war or actual war, or failure of our or our parent's internal computer network and applications to operate as designed.. <U+FEFF>. Terrorist attacks in the United States, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with them, including threats of war or actual war, may adversely affect our and our parent's financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and ability to make distributions to our unitholders. Ethanol-related assets (including ethanol production plants, such as those owned and operated by our parent on which we are substantially dependent, and storage facilities, fuel terminal facilities and railcars such as those owned and operated by us or our parent) may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets. A direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our unitholders. In addition, any terrorist attack could have an adverse impact on ethanol prices, including prices for our parent's ethanol. Disruption or significant increases in ethanol prices could result in government imposed price controls.. <U+FEFF>. We and our parent rely on network infrastructure and enterprise applications, and internal technology systems for operational, marketing support and sales, and product development activities. The hardware and software systems related to such activities are subject to damage from earthquakes, floods, lightning, tornados, fire, power loss, telecommunication failures, cyber-attacks and other similar events. They are also subject to acts such as computer viruses, physical or electronic vandalism or other similar disruptions that could cause system interruptions and loss of critical data, and could prevent us or our parent from fulfilling customers' orders. While we have taken reasonable efforts to protect ourselves, we cannot assure our unitholders that any of our or our parent's backup systems would be sufficient. Any event that causes failures or interruption in such hardware or software systems could result in disruption of our or our parent's business operations, have a negative impact on our parent's and our operating results, and damage each of our reputations, which could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operation, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. Risks Related to an Investment in Us. <U+FEFF>. Our parent owns and controls our general partner, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. Our general partner and its affiliates, including our parent and Green Plains Trade, have conflicts of interest with us and limited duties to us and our unitholders, and they may favor their own interests to our detriment and that of our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. Our parent owns and controls our general partner and appoints all of the directors of our general partner. Some of the directors and all of the executive officers of our general partner are also directors or officers of our parent. Although our general partner has a duty to manage us in a manner it believes to be in our best interests, the directors and officers of our general partner also have a duty to manage our general partner in a manner that is in the best interests of its owner, our parent. Conflicts of interest may arise between our general partner and its affiliates, including our parent and Green Plains Trade, on the one hand, and us and our unitholders, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts of interest, our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates, including our parent and Green Plains Trade, over the interests of our unitholders. These conflicts include, among others, the following situations:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tneither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires our parent to pursue a business strategy that favors us or utilizes our assets, which could involve decisions by our parent, which also controls Green Plains Trade, to increase or decrease their ethanol production, shutdown or reconfigure its ethanol facilities, enter into commercial agreements with us, undertake acquisition opportunities for itself, or pursue and grow particular markets. Our parent's directors and officers have a fiduciary duty to make these decisions in the best interests of our parent and its stockholders, which may be contrary to our interests and those of our unitholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour parent may be constrained by the terms of its debt instruments from taking actions, or refraining from taking actions, that may be in our best interests;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour parent has an economic incentive to cause us not to seek higher storage and service fees, even if such fees would reflect fees that could be obtained in arm's-length, third-party transactions, because Green Plains Trade, an indirect subsidiary of our parent, is our primary customer;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, borrowings, issuance of additional partnership securities, and the creation, reduction or increase of cash reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour general partner may cause us to borrow funds in order to permit the payment of cash distributions, even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to make a distribution on the subordinated units, to make incentive distributions or to accelerate the expiration of the subordination period;. 26.

This cash may be used to fund distributions on our subordinated units or the incentive distribution rights;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us in exercising certain rights under our partnership agreement;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour partnership agreement replaces the duties that would otherwise be owed by our general partner with contractual standards governing its duties, limiting our general partner's liabilities and restricting the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that, without the limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texcept in limited circumstances, our general partner has the power and authority to conduct our business and transfer its incentive distribution rights without unitholder approval;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour general partner determines the amount and timing of many of our cash expenditures and whether a cash expenditure is classified as an expansion capital expenditure, which would not reduce operating surplus, or a maintenance capital expenditure, which would reduce our operating surplus. This determination can affect the amount of available cash from operating surplus that is distributed to our unitholders and to our general partner, the amount of adjusted operating surplus generated in any given period and the ability of the subordinated units to convert into common units;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour general partner may exercise its right to call and purchase all of the common units not owned by it and its affiliates if it and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by our general partner and its affiliates, including our commercial agreements with its subsidiary, Green Plains Trade;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour general partner, as the holder of our incentive distribution rights, may elect to cause us to issue common units to it in connection with a resetting of target distribution levels related to our general partner's incentive distribution rights without the approval of the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner or our unitholders. This election may result in lower distributions to our unitholders in certain situations.. <U+FEFF>. Except as provided in our omnibus agreement, affiliates of our general partner, including our parent and Green Plains Trade, may compete with us, and neither our general partner nor its affiliates have any obligations to present business opportunities to us.. <U+FEFF>. Except as provided in our omnibus agreement, affiliates of our general partner, including our parent and Green Plains Trade, may compete with us. Pursuant to the terms of our partnership agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, does not apply to our general partner or any of its affiliates, including our parent and Green Plains Trade, and their respective executive officers and directors. Any such person or entity that becomes aware of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for us does not have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to us. Any such person or entity is not liable to us or to any limited partner for breach of any fiduciary duty or other duty by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to another person or entity or does not communicate such opportunity or information to us. This may create actual and potential conflicts of interest between us and affiliates of our general partner, including our parent and Green Plains Trade, and result in less than favorable treatment of us and our common unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. Our general partner intends to limit its liability regarding our obligations.. <U+FEFF>. Our general partner intends to limit its liability under contractual arrangements between us and third parties so that the counterparties to such arrangements have recourse only against our assets and not against our general partner or its assets. Our general partner may therefore cause us to incur indebtedness or other obligations that are nonrecourse to our general partner. Our partnership agreement provides that any action taken by our general partner to limit its liability is not a breach of our general partner's duties, even if we could have obtained more favorable terms without the limitation on liability. In addition, we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify our general partner to the extent that it incurs obligations on our behalf. Any such reimbursement or indemnification payments would reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. 27. Table of Contents. Ongoing cost reimbursements and fees due to our general partner and its affiliates for services provided, which are determined by our general partner in its sole discretion, are substantial and reduce the amount of cash that we have available for distribution to our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. Prior to making distributions on our common units, we reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all expenses they incur on our behalf. These expenses include all costs incurred by our general partner and its affiliates in managing and operating us, including costs for rendering certain management, maintenance and operational services to us, reimbursable pursuant to the operational services and secondment agreement. Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner determines the expenses that are allocable to us in good faith. Under the omnibus agreement, we have agreed to reimburse our parent for certain direct or allocated costs and expenses incurred by our parent in providing general and administrative services in support of our business. In addition, under Delaware partnership law, our general partner has unlimited liability for our obligations, such as our debts and environmental liabilities, except for our contractual obligations that are expressly made without recourse to our general partner. To the extent our general partner incurs obligations on our behalf, we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify it. If we are unable or unwilling to reimburse or indemnify our general partner, our general partner may take actions to cause us to make payments of these obligations and liabilities. Payments to our general partner and its affiliates, including our parent, are substantial and reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash, which could limit our ability to grow and make acquisitions.. <U+FEFF>. Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash to our unitholders. As a result, we rely primarily upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund our expansion capital expenditures and acquisitions. Therefore, to the extent that we are unable to finance growth externally, our cash distribution policy significantly impairs our ability to grow.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, because we distribute all of our available cash, our growth may not be as fast as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations. To the extent we issue additional partnership interests in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures or as in-kind distributions, our current unitholders will experience dilution and the payment of distributions on those additional partnership interests may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level. There are no limitations in our partnership agreement, and we do not anticipate that there will be limitations in our revolving credit facility, on our ability to issue additional partnership securities, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt to finance our growth strategy would result in increased debt service costs which, in turn, may impact the available cash that we have to distribute to our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. Our partnership agreement replaces our general partner's fiduciary duties to holders of our common units with contractual standards governing its duties.. <U+FEFF>. As permitted by Delaware law, our partnership agreement contains provisions that eliminate the fiduciary standards that our general partner would otherwise be held to by state fiduciary duty law and replaces those duties with several different contractual standards. For example, our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner, or otherwise, free of any duties to us and our unitholders. This entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires, and it has no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or our limited partners. Examples of decisions that our general partner may make in its individual capacity include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thow to allocate business opportunities among us and its other affiliates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhether to exercise its call rights;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thow to exercise its voting rights with respect to the units it owns;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhether to exercise its registration rights;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhether to elect to reset target distribution levels;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhether or not to consent to any merger or consolidation of the partnership or amendment to the partnership agreement; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhether or not the general partner should elect to seek the approval of the conflicts committee or the unitholders, or neither, of any conflicted transaction.. <U+FEFF>. 28. Table of Contents. By purchasing a common unit, a unitholder is treated as having consented to the provisions in our partnership agreement, including the provisions discussed above.. <U+FEFF>. Our partnership agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of our common units and our subordinated units for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.. <U+FEFF>. Our partnership agreement contains provisions that restrict the remedies available to our unitholders for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty under state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement provides that:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhenever our general partner makes a determination or takes, or declines to take, any other action in its capacity as our general partner, our general partner is required to make such determination, or take or decline to take such other action, in good faith, and is not subject to any higher standard imposed by our partnership agreement, Delaware law, or any other law, rule or regulation, or at equity;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour general partner does not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as a general partner so long as it acted in good faith;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour general partner and its officers and directors are not liable for monetary damages to us or our limited partners resulting from any act or omission unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that our general partner or its officers and directors, as the case may be, acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the conduct was unlawful; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour general partner is not in breach of its obligations under the partnership agreement or its duties to us or our limited partners if a transaction with an affiliate or the resolution of a conflict of interest is:. o \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tapproved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner, although our general partner is not obligated to seek such approval;. o \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tapproved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding common units, excluding any common units owned by our general partner and its affiliates; or. o \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\totherwise meets the standards set forth in our partnership agreement.. <U+FEFF>. In connection with a situation involving a transaction with an affiliate or a conflict of interest, our partnership agreement provides that any determination by our general partner must be made in good faith, and that our conflicts committee and the board of directors of our general partner are entitled to a presumption that they acted in good faith. In any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or the partnership, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption.. <U+FEFF>. Our partnership agreement designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our unitholders, which limits our unitholders' ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our general partner's directors, officers or other employees.. <U+FEFF>. Our partnership agreement provides that, with certain limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for any claims, suits, actions or proceedings (1) arising out of or relating in any way to our partnership agreement (including any claims, suits or actions to interpret, apply or enforce the provisions of our partnership agreement or the duties, obligations or liabilities among limited partners or of limited partners to us, or the rights or powers of, or restrictions on, the limited partners or us), (2) brought in a derivative manner on our behalf, (3) asserting a claim of breach of a duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of us or our general partner, or owed by our general partner, to us or the limited partners, (4) asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, or the Delaware Act, or (5) asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine, each referred to as a unitholder action. By purchasing a common unit, a limited partner is irrevocably consenting to these limitations and provisions regarding unitholder actions and submitting to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or such other court) in connection with any such unitholder actions. These provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us and our general partner's directors and officers that may otherwise benefit us and our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. 29. Table of Contents. Our partnership agreement provides that any unitholder bringing certain unsuccessful unitholder actions is obligated to reimburse us for any costs we have incurred in connection with such unsuccessful unitholder action.. <U+FEFF>. If any unitholder brings any unitholder action and such person does not obtain a judgment on the merits that substantially. achieves, in substance and amount, the full remedy sought, then such person shall be obligated to reimburse us and our affiliates for all fees, costs and expenses of every kind and description, including but not limited to all reasonable attorneys' fees and other litigation expenses, that the parties may incur in connection with such unitholder action. For purposes of these provisions, \"our affiliates\" means any person that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with us, and \"control\" means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such person. Examples of \"our affiliates,\" as used in these provisions, include Green Plains, our general partner, and the directors and officers of our general partner, and, depending on the situation, other third parties that fit within the definition of \"our affiliates\" described above.. <U+FEFF>. A limited partner or any person holding a beneficial interest in us (whether through a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or clearing corporation or an agent of any of the foregoing or otherwise) is subject to these provisions. By purchasing a common unit, a limited partner is irrevocably consenting to these potential reimbursement obligations regarding unitholder actions. These provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us and our general partner's directors and officers that might otherwise benefit us and our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. The reimbursement provision in our partnership agreement is not limited to specific types of unitholder action but is rather potentially applicable to the fullest extent permitted by law. Such reimbursement provisions are relatively new and untested. The case law and potential legislative action on these types of reimbursement provisions are evolving and there exists considerable uncertainty regarding the validity of, and potential judicial and legislative responses to, such provisions. For example, it is unclear whether our ability to invoke such reimbursement in connection with unitholder actions under federal securities laws would be pre-empted by federal law. Similarly, it is unclear how courts might apply the standard that a claiming party must obtain a judgment that substantially achieves, in substance and amount, the full remedy sought. For example, in the event the claiming party were to allege multiple claims and does not receive a favorable judgment for the full remedy sought for each of its alleged claims, it is unclear how courts would apportion our fees, costs and expenses, and whether courts would require the claiming party to reimburse us and our affiliates in full for all fees, costs and expenses relating to each of the claims, including those for which the claiming party received the remedy it sought. The application of our reimbursement provision in connection with such unitholder actions, if any, depends in part on future developments of the law. This uncertainty may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us and our general partner's directors and officers that might otherwise benefit us and our unitholders. In addition, given the unsettled state of the law related to reimbursement provisions, such as ours, we may incur significant additional costs associated with resolving disputes with respect to such provision, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. Our general partner, or any transferee holding incentive distribution rights, may elect to cause us to issue common units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to its incentive distribution rights, without the approval of the conflicts committee or the holders of our common units, which could result in lower distributions to holders of our common units.. <U+FEFF>. Our general partner has the right, as the initial holder of our incentive distribution rights, at any time when there are no subordinated units outstanding and our general partner has received incentive distributions at the highest level to which it is entitled (48%, in addition to distributions paid on its 2% general partner interest) for each of the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters and the amount of each such distribution did not exceed the adjusted operating surplus for such quarter, to reset the initial target distribution levels at higher levels based on our distributions at the time of the exercise of the reset election. Following a reset election by our general partner, the minimum quarterly distribution will be adjusted to equal the reset minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be reset to correspondingly higher levels based on percentage increases above the reset minimum quarterly distribution.. <U+FEFF>. If our general partner elects to reset the target distribution levels, it will be entitled to receive a number of common units. The number of common units to be issued to our general partner will equal the number of common units that would have entitled the holder to an aggregate quarterly cash distribution in the quarter prior to the reset election equal to the distribution to our general partner on the incentive distribution rights in the quarter prior to the reset election. Our general partner will also be issued the number of general partner interests necessary to maintain our general partner's interest in us at the level that existed immediately prior to the reset election. We anticipate that our general partner would exercise this reset right in order to facilitate acquisitions or internal growth projects that would not be sufficiently accretive to cash distributions per common unit without such reset. It is possible, however, that our general partner could exercise this reset election at a time when it is experiencing, or expects to experience, declines in the cash distributions it receives related to its incentive. 30. Table of Contents. distribution rights and may, therefore, desire to be issued common units rather than retain the right to receive incentive distributions based on the initial target distribution levels. This risk could be elevated if our incentive distribution rights have been transferred to a third party. As a result, a reset election may cause our common unitholders to experience a reduction in the amount of cash distributions that our common unitholders would have otherwise received had we not issued new common units and general partner interests to our general partner in connection with resetting the target distribution levels.. <U+FEFF>. Our general partner has a limited call right that may require our unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price.. <U+FEFF>. If at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than 80% of our then-outstanding common units, our general partner will have the right, but not the obligation, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price equal to the greater of (1) the average of the daily closing price of the common units over the 20 trading days preceding the date three business days before notice of exercise of the call right is first mailed and (2) the highest per-unit price paid by our general partner or any of its affiliates for common units during the 90-day period preceding the date such notice is first mailed. As a result, our unitholders may be required to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return, or may receive a negative return, on their investment. Our unitholders may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their common units. Our general partner is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the value of the common units to be repurchased by it upon exercise of the limited call right. There is no restriction in our partnership agreement that prevents our general partner from issuing additional common units and exercising its call right. Our parent owns an aggregate of approximately  27.9% of our outstanding common units (excluding any common units owned by directors, director nominees and executive officers of our general partner or of Green Plains). At the end of the subordination period (which could have occurred as early as within the quarter ending September 30, 2016), assuming no additional issuances of common units (other than upon the conversion of the subordinated units), our parent will own an aggregate of approximately 64.1% of our outstanding common units (excluding any common units owned by directors, director nominees and executive officers of our general partner or of Green Plains) and therefore would not be able to exercise the call right at that time.. <U+FEFF>. Our unitholders have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our general partner or the board of directors of our general partner, which could reduce the price at which our common units trade.. <U+FEFF>. Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management's decisions regarding our business. For example, unlike holders of stock in a public corporation, unitholders do not have \"say-on-pay\" advisory voting rights. Our unitholders did not elect our general partner or the board of directors of our general partner, and have no right to elect our general partner or the board of directors of our general partner on an annual or other continuing basis. The board of directors of our general partner, including its independent directors, is chosen by the member of our general partner. Furthermore, if our unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they have little ability to remove our general partner. Our partnership agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of our unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting our unitholders' ability to influence the manner or direction of management. As a result of these limitations, the price at which our common units trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price.. <U+FEFF>. Even if our unitholders are dissatisfied, they cannot initially remove our general partner without its consent.. <U+FEFF>. Our unitholders are unable to remove our general partner without its consent because our general partner and its affiliates own sufficient units to be able to prevent its removal. The vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of all outstanding common units and subordinated units voting together as a single class is required to remove the general partner. Our parent owns approximately 64.1%  of our total outstanding common units and subordinated units on an aggregate basis (excluding any common units owned by directors, director nominees and executive officers of our general partner or of Green Plains). Also, if our general partner is removed without cause during the subordination period and common units and subordinated units held by our general partner and its affiliates are not voted in favor of that removal, all remaining subordinated units will automatically convert into common units and any existing arrearages on our common units will be extinguished. A removal of our general partner under these circumstances would adversely affect our common units by prematurely eliminating their distribution and liquidation preference over our subordinated units, which would otherwise have continued until we had met certain distribution and performance tests. Cause is narrowly defined under our partnership agreement to mean that a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final, non-appealable judgment finding the general partner liable for actual fraud or willful misconduct in its capacity as our general partner. Cause does not include most cases of charges of poor management of the business.. <U+FEFF>. 31. Table of Contents. Our partnership agreement eliminates the voting rights of certain of our unitholders owning 20% or more of our common units.. <U+FEFF>. Our unitholders' voting rights are further restricted by the partnership agreement provision providing that any units held by a person that owns 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding, other than our general partner, its affiliates, including our parent, their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our general partner, cannot vote on any matter.. <U+FEFF>. Our general partner's interest in us or the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.. <U+FEFF>. Our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Furthermore, our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of our parent from transferring all or a portion of its ownership interest in our general partner to a third party. The new owner of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of our general partner with its own choices and thereby exert significant control over the decisions made by the board of directors and officers. This effectively permits a \"change of control\" without the vote or consent of our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. The incentive distribution rights held by our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.. <U+FEFF>. Our general partner may transfer all or a portion of its incentive distribution rights to a third party at any time without the consent of our unitholders, and such transferee shall have the same rights as the general partner relative to resetting target distributions if our general partner concurs that the test for resetting target distributions have been fulfilled. If our general partner transfers the incentive distribution rights to a third party it may not have the same incentive to grow our partnership and increase quarterly distributions to our unitholders over time as it would if it had retained ownership of the incentive distribution rights. For example, a transfer of incentive distribution rights by our general partner could reduce the likelihood of our parent accepting offers made by us relating to assets owned by it and our parent would have less of an economic incentive to grow our business, which in turn would impact our ability to grow our asset base.. <U+FEFF>. We may issue additional partnership interests, including units that are senior to the common units, without unitholder approval, which would dilute our unitholders' existing ownership interests.. <U+FEFF>. Our partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional limited partner interests or general partner interests that we may issue at any time without the approval of our unitholders. The issuance by us of additional common units, general partner interests or other equity securities of equal or senior rank to our common units as to distributions or in liquidation or that have special voting rights or other rights, have the following effects:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teach unitholder's proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe amount of distributable cash flow on each unit may decrease;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbecause a lower percentage of total outstanding units will be subordinated units, the risk that a shortfall in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution will be borne by our common unitholders will increase;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbecause the amount payable to holders of incentive distribution rights is based on a percentage of the total distributable cash flow, the distributions to holders of incentive distribution rights will increase even if the per unit distribution on common units remains the same;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe claims of the common unitholders to our assets in the event of our liquidation may be subordinated; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe market price of the common units may decline.. <U+FEFF>. The issuance by us of additional general partner interests may have the following effects, among others, if such general partner interests are issued to a person that is not an affiliate of our parent:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmanagement of our business may no longer reside solely with our current general partner; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\taffiliates of the newly admitted general partner may compete with us, and neither that general partner nor such affiliates will have any obligation to send business opportunities to us.. <U+FEFF>. 32. Table of Contents. Common units eligible for future sale may cause the price of our common units to decline.. <U+FEFF>. Sales of substantial amounts of our common units in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur,. could cause the market price of our common units to decline. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our equity interests. Our parent holds 4,389,642 common units and 15,889,642 subordinated units. All of the subordinated units will convert into common units at the end of the subordination period and some may convert earlier under certain circumstances. Additionally, we have agreed to provide our parent with certain registration rights under applicable securities laws. The sale of these common units in public or private markets could have an adverse impact on the price of the common units or on any trading market that may develop.. <U+FEFF>. Our general partner's discretion in establishing cash reserves may reduce the amount of distributable cash flow to our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. Our partnership agreement requires our general partner to deduct from operating surplus the cash reserves that it determines are necessary to fund our future operating expenditures. In addition, our partnership agreement permits the general partner to reduce available cash by establishing cash reserves for the proper conduct of our business, to comply with applicable law or agreements that we are a party to, or to provide funds for future distributions to partners. These cash reserves affect the amount of distributable cash flow to our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. If we distribute available cash from capital surplus, which is analogous to a return of capital, our minimum quarterly distribution will be proportionately reduced, and the target distribution relating to our general partner's incentive distributions will be proportionately decreased.. <U+FEFF>. Our distributions of available cash are characterized as derived from either operating surplus or capital surplus. Operating surplus as defined in our partnership agreement generally means amounts we have received from operations or \"earned,\" less operating expenditures and cash reserves to provide funds for our future operations. Capital surplus is defined in our partnership agreement as any distribution of available cash in excess of our cumulative operating surplus, and generally would result from cash received from non-operating sources such as sales of other dispositions of assets and issuances of debt and equity securities.. <U+FEFF>. Our partnership agreement treats a distribution of capital surplus as the repayment of the IPO initial unit price, which is analogous to a return of capital. Each time a distribution of capital surplus is made, the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be proportionately reduced. Because distributions of capital surplus will reduce the minimum quarterly distribution after any of these distributions are made, the effects of distributions of capital surplus may make it easier for our general partner to receive incentive distributions and for the subordinated units to convert into common units.. <U+FEFF>. Unitholder liability may not be limited if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of our business.. <U+FEFF>. A general partner of a partnership generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership, except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner. Our partnership is organized under Delaware law, and we own assets and conduct business throughout much of the United States. Our unitholders could be liable for any and all of our obligations as if they were a general partner if:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta court or government agency determines that we were conducting business in a state but had not complied with that particular state's partnership statute; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunitholder rights to act with other unitholders to remove or replace the general partner, to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or to take other actions under our partnership agreement constitute \"control\" of our business.. <U+FEFF>. Our unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them.. <U+FEFF>. Under certain circumstances, our unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully distributed to them. Under Section 17-607 of the Delaware Act, we may not make a distribution to our unitholders if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount. Substituted limited partners are liable for the obligations of the assignor to make contributions to the partnership that are known to the substituted limited partner at the time it became a limited partner and for unknown obligations if the liabilities could be determined from the. 33. Table of Contents. partnership agreement. Liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interest and liabilities that are nonrecourse to the partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted.. <U+FEFF>. The price of our common units may fluctuate significantly, which could cause our unitholders to lose all or part of their investment.. <U+FEFF>. As of December 31, 2017, there are 11,532,565 publicly traded common units. In addition, our parent owns 4,389,642 common units and 15,889,642 subordinated units, representing an aggregate 62.5% limited partner interest in us. Our unitholders may not be able to resell their common units at or above their purchase price. Additionally, the lack of liquidity may result in wide bid-ask spreads, contribute to significant fluctuations in the market price of the common units and limit the number of investors who are able to buy the common units.. <U+FEFF>. The market price of our common units may decline below current levels. The market price of our common units may also be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour operating and financial performance;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tquarterly variations in our financial indicators, such as net earnings (loss) per unit, net earnings (loss) and revenues;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe amount of distributions we make and our earnings or those of other companies in our industry or other publicly traded partnerships;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe loss of our parent or one of its subsidiaries, such as Green Plains Trade, as a customer;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tevents affecting the business and operations of our parent;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in revenue or earnings estimates, or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage, by equity research analysts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tspeculation in the press or investment community;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadditions or departures of key management personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactions by our unitholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdomestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors related to our performance;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfuture sales of our common units by us or our other unitholders, or the perception that such sales may occur; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother factors described in this report under Item 1A  -  Risk Factors.. <U+FEFF>. As a result of these factors, investors in our common units may not be able to resell their common units at or above the current trading price. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies like us. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common units, regardless of our operating performance.. <U+FEFF>. Nasdaq does not require a publicly traded partnership like us to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements.. <U+FEFF>. We have listed our common units on Nasdaq. Because we are a publicly traded partnership, Nasdaq does not require us to have a majority of independent directors on our general partner's board of directors or to establish a compensation committee or a nominating and corporate governance committee. Accordingly, our unitholders do not have the same protections afforded to certain corporations that are subject to all of Nasdaq's corporate governance requirements.. <U+FEFF>. 34. Table of Contents. We incur increased costs as a result of being a publicly traded partnership.. <U+FEFF>. We have limited history operating as a publicly traded partnership. As a publicly traded partnership, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur prior to the IPO. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq, require publicly traded entities to adopt various corporate governance practices that further increase our costs. Before we are able to make distributions to our unitholders, we must first pay or reserve cash for our expenses, including the costs of being a publicly traded partnership. As a result, the amount of cash we have available for distribution to our unitholders is affected by the costs associated with being a public company.. <U+FEFF>. We are subject to the public reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. We expect these rules and regulations to increase certain of our legal and financial compliance costs and to make activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, the board of directors of our general partner is required to have at least three independent directors, create an audit committee and adopt policies regarding internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures, including the preparation of reports on internal controls over financial reporting. In addition, we incur additional costs associated with our SEC reporting requirements and preparation of various tax documents, including Schedule K-1s.. <U+FEFF>. We also incur significant expense in order to obtain director and officer liability insurance. Because of the limitations in coverage for directors, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on the board of directors of our general partner or as executive officers.. <U+FEFF>. Pursuant to the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as long as we are an emerging growth company.. <U+FEFF>. We are required to disclose changes made in our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis, and we are required to assess the effectiveness of our controls annually. However, for as long as we are an \"emerging growth company\" under the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to provide an auditor's attestation report on management's assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years from the date of the IPO. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and timely financial reports, prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a publicly traded partnership. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, but our internal accounting controls may not meet all standards applicable to companies with publicly traded securities. Our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls may not be successful, and we may be unable to maintain effective controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or to comply with our obligations under Section 404. For example, Section 404 requires us, among other things, to annually review and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We must comply with Section 404 (except for the requirement for an auditor's attestation report) for all fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2016. Any failure to develop, implement or maintain effective internal controls or to improve our internal controls could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Even if we conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, once our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to our assessment they may decline to attest or may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our controls or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us.. <U+FEFF>. Given the difficulties inherent in the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, in addition to our limited accounting personnel and management resources, we can provide no assurance as to our or our independent registered public accounting firm's future conclusions about the effectiveness of our internal controls, and we may incur significant costs in our efforts to comply with Section 404. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting subjects us to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of confidence in our reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on our business and would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common units.. <U+FEFF>. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an \"emerging growth company.\" We cannot predict if investors will find our common units less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common units less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common units, and our trading price may be more volatile.. <U+FEFF>. 35. Table of Contents. Tax Risks to Our Unitholders. <U+FEFF>. Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Internal Revenue Service were to treat us as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which would subject us to entity-level taxation, or if we were otherwise subjected to a material amount of additional entity-level taxation, then our distributable cash flow to our unitholders would be substantially reduced.. <U+FEFF>. The anticipated after-tax benefit of an investment in our units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.. <U+FEFF>. Despite the fact that we are a limited partnership under Delaware law, it is possible in certain circumstances for a partnership such as ours to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A change in our business or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity.. <U+FEFF>. If we were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would pay U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which was a maximum of 35% at December 31, 2017, decreasing to 21% on January 1, 2018, and would likely pay state and local income tax at varying rates. Distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate dividends (to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits), and no income, gains, losses, deductions, or credits would flow through to our unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our distributable cash flow would be substantially reduced. In addition, changes in current state law may subject us to additional entity-level taxation by individual states. Because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons, several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation. Imposition of any such taxes may substantially reduce the distributable cash flow to our unitholders. Therefore, if we were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subjected to a material amount of entity-level taxation, there would be material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our units.. <U+FEFF>. Our partnership agreement provides that, if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity-level taxation for U.S. federal, state or local income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution levels may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us.. <U+FEFF>. The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes or differing interpretations, possibly applied on a retroactive basis.. <U+FEFF>. The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial interpretation at any time. In addition, from time to time, members of Congress and the President propose and consider substantive changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships, including the elimination of partnership tax treatment for publicly traded partnerships. Any modification to the U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be retroactively applied and could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the exception for us to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.. <U+FEFF>. For example, in May 2015, the Department of Treasury issued proposed regulations regarding qualifying income for publicly traded partnerships. The proposed regulations provide rules regarding the types of natural resource activities that generate qualifying income for publicly traded partnerships. On January 19, 2017, the Department of Treasury publicly released the text of final regulations regarding qualifying income, which were published in the Federal Register on January 24, 2017. On January 20, 2017, the Trump administration released a memorandum that generally delayed all pending regulations from publication in the Federal Register pending review and approval. It is unclear whether the final regulations will remain effective in their current form or whether the final regulations will be revised.. <U+FEFF>. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or any other proposals will ultimately be enacted or adopted. However, it is possible that a change in law could affect us, and any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units.. <U+FEFF>. 36. Table of Contents. If the IRS were to contest the U.S. federal income tax positions we take, it may adversely impact the market for our common units, and the costs of any such contest would reduce distributable cash flow to our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. We have not requested a ruling from the IRS with respect to our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the positions we take, even if taken with the advice of counsel, and the IRS's positions may ultimately be sustained. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take. A court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take. Any contest with the IRS may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the prices at which they trade. Moreover, the costs of any contest between us and the IRS will result in a reduction in distributable cash flow to our unitholders and thus will be borne indirectly by our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. As part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, enacted on November 2, 2015, legislation was passed requiring large partnerships to pay federal tax deficiencies. This differs from the current rules which require tax deficiency collection from the partners directly. A tax assessment paid by the partnership would reduce distributable cash flow available to unitholders, potentially for tax assessments related to years in which they did not own partnership units. The new rules are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.. <U+FEFF>. Even if our unitholders do not receive any cash distributions from us, our unitholders are required to pay taxes on their share of our taxable income.. <U+FEFF>. Because our unitholders are treated as partners to whom we allocate taxable income that could be different in amount than the cash we distribute, our unitholders' allocable share of our taxable income is taxable to our unitholders, which may require the payment of U.S. federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes, on our unitholders' share of our taxable income even if our unitholders receive no cash distributions from us. Our unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income.. <U+FEFF>. There have been substantial changes to the Internal Revenue Code, some of which could have an adverse effect on our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017, effective on January 1, 2018. Among other provisions, the new law reduces the federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition, the new law provides for the simplification and reform of individual income tax rates, enhancement of the standard deduction, and the repeal of personal exemptions. This new law may impact the partnership's unitholders, depending upon their unique facts and circumstances, and as such we cannot determine whether it will have a positive or negative affect on our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. Tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected.. <U+FEFF>. If our unitholders sell common units, they will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and their tax basis in those common units. Because distributions in excess of their allocable share of our net taxable income decrease their tax basis in their common units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the common units they sell will, in effect, become taxable income to them if they sell such common units at a price greater than the tax basis therein, even if the price they receive is less than their original cost. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income to such unitholder due to potential recapture items, including depreciation recapture. In addition, because the amount realized includes a unitholder's share of our nonrecourse liabilities, if our unitholders sell common units, they may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash they receive from the sale.. <U+FEFF>. Tax-exempt entities and non-U.S. persons owning our common units face unique tax issues that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.. <U+FEFF>. Investment in our common units by tax-exempt entities, such as IRAs, and non-U.S. persons, raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations exempt from U.S. federal income tax, including IRAs and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them. Distributions to non-U.S. persons will be reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate, and non-U.S. persons will be required to file U.S. federal income tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income. Tax exempt entities and non-U.S. persons should consult a tax advisor before investing in our common units.. <U+FEFF>. 37. Table of Contents. We treat each purchaser of our common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the common units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of our common units.. <U+FEFF>. Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and because of other reasons, we adopted depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury Regulations. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our unitholders. Our counsel is unable to opine as to the validity of such filing positions. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from the sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders' tax returns.. <U+FEFF>. We prorate our items of income, gain, loss, and deduction between transferors and transferees of our common units each month based upon the ownership of our common units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular common unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss, and deduction among our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. We prorate our items of income, gain, loss, and deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes between transferors and transferees of our common units each month based upon the ownership of our common units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular common unit is transferred. Although simplifying conventions are contemplated by the Internal Revenue Code and most publicly traded partnerships use similar simplifying conventions, the use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing Treasury Regulations.  The U.S. Treasury recently adopted final Treasury Regulations allowing similar monthly simplifying conventions. However, the final Treasury Regulations do not specifically authorize the use of the proration method that we have adopted and, accordingly, our counsel is unable to opine as to the validity of this method. If the IRS were to challenge our proration method, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss, and deduction among our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. A unitholder whose common units are the subject of a securities loan (e.g., a loan to a \"short seller\" to cover a short sale of common units) may be considered as having disposed of those common units. If so, he would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.. <U+FEFF>. Because a unitholder whose common units are loaned to a \"short seller\" to effect a short sale of common units may be considered as having disposed of the loaned common units, he may no longer be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan to the short seller, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those common units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to consult a tax advisor to discuss whether it is advisable to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from loaning their common units.. <U+FEFF>. We will adopt certain valuation methodologies that may result in a shift of income, gain, loss, and deduction between our unitholders. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units.. <U+FEFF>. When we issue additional common units or engage in certain other transactions, we will determine the fair market value of our assets and allocate any unrealized gain or loss attributable to our assets to the capital accounts of our unitholders and our general partner. Our methodology may be viewed as understating the value of our assets. In that case, there may be a shift of income, gain, loss, and deduction between certain of our unitholders and our general partner, which may be unfavorable to such unitholders. Moreover, under our valuation methods, subsequent purchasers of common units may have a greater portion of their Internal Revenue Code Section 743(b) adjustment allocated to our tangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to our intangible assets. The IRS may challenge our valuation methods, or our allocation of the Section 743(b) adjustment attributable to our tangible and intangible assets, and allocations of income, gain, loss, and deduction between our general partner and certain of our unitholders.. <U+FEFF>. A successful IRS challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders. It also could affect the amount of taxable gain from our unitholders' sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders' tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions.. <U+FEFF>. 38. Table of Contents. The sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profits interests within a twelve-month period will result in the termination of us as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.. <U+FEFF>. We will be considered to have technically terminated our partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelve-month period. For purposes of determining whether the 50% threshold has been met, multiple sales of the same interest will be counted only once. Our technical termination would, among other things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders, which would result in our filing two tax returns (and our unitholders could receive two Schedule K-1s if relief was not available, as described below) for one fiscal year and could result in a significant deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income. In the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending December 31, the closing of our taxable year may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in taxable income for the unitholder's taxable year that includes our termination. Our termination currently would not affect our classification as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but it would result in our being treated as a new partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes following the termination. If we were treated as a new partnership, we would be required to make new tax elections, including a new election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code, and could be subject to penalties if we were unable to determine that a termination occurred. The IRS announced a relief procedure whereby if a publicly traded partnership that has technically terminated requests and the IRS grants special relief, among other things, the partnership may be permitted to provide one Schedule K-1 to unitholders for the year notwithstanding two partnership tax years.. <U+FEFF>. As a result of investing in our common units, our unitholders may be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in jurisdictions where we operate or own or acquire properties.. <U+FEFF>. In addition to U.S. federal income taxes, our unitholders may be subject to other taxes, including foreign, state, and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes, and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or control property now or in the future, even if our unitholders do not live in any of those jurisdictions. Our unitholders may be required to file foreign, state, and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions. Further, our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. We expect to conduct business in multiple states, many of which impose a personal income tax on individuals as well as corporations and other entities. It is the responsibility of our unitholders to file all U.S. federal, foreign, state, and local tax returns.. <U+FEFF>"
