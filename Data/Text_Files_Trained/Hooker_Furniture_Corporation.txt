[1] "ITEM 1A.          RISK FACTORS. Our business is subject to a variety of risks. The risk factors discussed below should be considered in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K. If any of these risks actually materialize, our business, results of operations, financial condition or future prospects could be negatively impacted. These risks are not the only ones we face.  There may be additional risks that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial that could affect us.. We rely on offshore sourcing from Vietnam and China for most of our sales. Consequently:. §    A disruption in supply from Vietnam or China or from our most significant Vietnamese or Chinese suppliers could adversely affect our ability to timely fill customer orders for these products and decrease our sales, earnings and liquidity.. In fiscal 2018, imported products sourced from Vietnam and China accounted for nearly all of our import purchases and our top five suppliers in Vietnam and China account for approximately half of our fiscal 2018 import purchases. Furniture manufacturing creates large amounts of highly flammable wood dust and utilizes other highly flammable materials such as varnishes and solvents in its manufacturing processes and is therefore subject to the risk of losses arising from explosions and fires. A disruption in our supply chain, or from Vietnam or China in general, could significantly impact our ability to fill customer orders for products manufactured in those countries.  If such a disruption were to occur, we believe that we would have sufficient inventory on hand and in transit to our U.S. warehouses in Virginia, North Carolina and California to adequately meet demand for several months or slightly longer with an additional month's worth of demand available for immediate shipment from our warehouses in Asia. We believe that we could, most likely at higher cost, source most of the products currently sourced in Vietnam or China from factories in other countries and could produce certain upholstered products domestically at our own factories.  However, supply disruptions and delays on selected items could occur for up to six months before the impact of remedial measures would be reflected in our results.  If we were to be unsuccessful in obtaining those products from other sources or at comparable cost, a disruption in our supply chain from our largest import furniture suppliers, or from Vietnam or China in general, could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.. 9. Table of Contents. §    Increased freight costs on imported products could decrease earnings and liquidity.. Ocean freight costs on imported products currently represent a significant portion of the cost of our imported products. Ocean freight rates on our imported products remain near historical lows due to a myriad of factors including sluggish global growth, low petroleum prices and overcapacity among ocean freight carriers. While we believe ocean freight rates are at or near the lower range of possible costs, we are unable to predict how much longer these low rates will persist. Increased rates in the future would likely adversely affect earnings, financial condition and liquidity.. §    We are subject to changes in U.S. and foreign government regulations and in the political, social and economic climates of the countries from which we source our products.. Changes in political, economic, and social conditions, as well as in the laws and regulations in the foreign countries from which we source our products could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.  These changes could make it more difficult to provide products and service to our customers or could increase the cost of those products.  International trade regulations and policies of the United States and the countries from which we source finished products could adversely affect us.  Imposition of trade sanctions relating to imports, taxes, import duties and other charges on imports affecting our products could increase our costs and decrease our earnings.  For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposes tariffs on wooden bedroom furniture coming into the United States from China. In this case, none of the rates imposed have been of sufficient magnitude to alter our import strategy in any meaningful way; however, these and other tariffs are subject to review and could be increased or new tariffs implemented in the future.. §    Our dependence on non-U.S. suppliers could, over time, adversely affect our ability to service customers.. We rely exclusively on non-U.S. suppliers for most of our products.  Our non-U.S. suppliers may not provide goods that meet our quality, design or other specifications in a timely manner and at a competitive price.  If our suppliers do not meet our specifications, we may need to find alternative suppliers, potentially at a higher cost, or may be forced to discontinue products.  Also, delivery of goods from non-U.S. suppliers may be delayed for reasons not typically encountered for domestically manufactured furniture, such as shipment delays caused by customs issues, labor issues, port-related issues such as weather, congestion or port equipment, decreased availability of shipping containers and/or the inability to secure space aboard shipping vessels to transport our products.  Our failure to timely fill customer orders due to an extended business interruption for a major non-U.S. supplier, or due to transportation issues, could negatively impact existing customer relationships and adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.. §    Our inability to accurately forecast demand for our imported products could cause us to purchase too much, too little or the wrong mix of inventory.. Manufacturing and delivery lead times for our imported products necessitate that we make forecasts and assumptions regarding current and future demand for these products. If our forecasts and assumptions are inaccurate, we may purchase excess or insufficient amounts of inventory. If we purchase too much or the wrong mix of inventory, we may be forced to sell it at lower margins, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity. If we purchase too little or the wrong mix of inventory, we may not be able to fill customer orders and may lose market share and weaken or damage customer relationships, which also could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.. §    Changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to the currencies for the countries from which we obtain our imported products could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.. For imported products, we generally negotiate firm pricing with our foreign suppliers in U.S. Dollars, typically for periods of at least one year.  We accept the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods. We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk, but could choose to do so in the future.  Since we transact our imported product purchases in U.S. Dollars, a relative decline in the value of the U.S. Dollar could increase the price we must pay for imported products beyond the negotiated periods.  These price changes could decrease our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity during affected periods.. 10. Table of Contents. §    Supplier transitions, including cost or quality issues, could result in longer lead times and shipping delays.. In the past, inflation concerns, and to a lesser extent quality and supplier viability concerns, affecting some of our imported product suppliers located in China prompted us to source more of our products from lower cost suppliers located in other countries, such as Vietnam. As conditions dictate, we could be forced to make similar transitions in the future.   When undertaken, transitions of this type involve significant planning and coordination by and between us and our new suppliers in these countries. Despite our best efforts and those of our new sourcing partners, these transition efforts are likely to result in longer lead times and shipping delays over the short term, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.. A material part of our sales and accounts receivable are concentrated in a few customers.   The loss of several large customers through business consolidations, failures or other reasons could adversely affect our business.. Although no customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated sales in fiscal 2018, our top five customers accounted for nearly one-third of our fiscal 2018 consolidated sales. Nearly half of our consolidated accounts receivable is concentrated in our top five customers.  Should any one of these receivables become uncollectible, it would have an immediate and material adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity. The loss of any one or more of these customers could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity. The loss of several of our major customers through business consolidations, failures or otherwise, could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity and the resulting loss in sales may be difficult or impossible to replace.  Amounts owed to us by a customer whose business fails, or is failing, may become uncollectible, and we could lose future sales, any of which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.. We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Shenandoah acquisition.. While we believe the Shenandoah acquisition, will be accretive to our earnings per share beginning in fiscal 2019, this expectation is based on preliminary estimates which may materially change. While we do not expect to merge operations or change customer-facing services, the success of this acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to improve each business by sharing best practices in order to lower costs, improve efficiencies and grow sales. While we have based our expectations in part on the historical results and trends in Shenandoah's business, there can be no assurance regarding when or the extent to which we will be able to realize these benefits. Achieving the anticipated benefits is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the business acquired can be operated in the manner we intend. Events outside of our control could also adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition. Thus, the integration of Shenandoah's business may be unpredictable, subject to delays or changed circumstances, and we can give no assurance that the acquired business will perform in accordance with our expectations, or that our expectations with respect to integration or benefits as a result of the contemplated acquisition will materialize.. Additionally, a major asset acquired in the acquisition was Shenandoah's existing customer relationships. Almost all of Shenandoah's sales and accounts receivable are concentrated in a very small number of customers. While we believe these relationships will continue and result in profitable sales, there can be no assurance they will.. The anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. The integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. If the integration is not completed as planned, our ongoing business and financial results may be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.. We may not be able to collect amounts owed to us.. We grant payment terms to most customers ranging from 30 to 60 days and do not generally require collateral. However, in some instances we provide longer payment terms. Some of our customers have experienced, and may in the future experience, credit-related issues. While we perform credit evaluations of our customers, those evaluations may not prevent uncollectible trade accounts receivable. Credit evaluations involve significant management diligence and judgment. Should more customers than we anticipate experience liquidity issues, or if payment is not received on a timely basis, we may have difficulty collecting amounts owed to us by these customers, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.. 11. Table of Contents. The interruption, inadequacy or security failure of our information systems or information technology infrastructure or the internet could adversely impact our business, sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.. Our information systems (software) and information technology (hardware) infrastructure platforms and those of third parties who provide these services to us, including internet service providers and third-parties who store data for us on their servers, facilitate and support every facet of our business, including the sourcing of raw materials and finished goods, planning, manufacturing, warehousing, customer service, shipping, accounting and human resources. Our systems, and those of third parties who provide services to us, are vulnerable to disruption or damage caused by a variety of factors including, but not limited to: power disruptions or outages; natural disasters or other so-called \"Acts of God\"; computer system or network failures; viruses or malware; physical or electronic break-ins; the theft of computers, tablets and smart phones utilized by our employees or contractors; unauthorized access, phishing and cyber-attacks. If these information systems or technologies are interrupted or fail, our operations may be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.. Unauthorized disclosure of confidential information provided to us by our customers, employees, or third parties could harm our business.. We rely on the internet and other electronic methods to transmit confidential information and we store confidential information on our networks. If there was a disclosure of confidential information by our employees or contractors, including accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of information, or if a third party were to gain access to the confidential information we possess, our reputation could be harmed and we could be subject to civil or criminal liability and regulatory actions. A claim that is brought against us, successful or unsuccessful, that is uninsured or under-insured could harm our business, result in substantial costs, divert management attention and adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.. We incurred significant debt to provide permanent financing for the Shenandoah acquisition and HMI acquisition.. We borrowed $60 million for the Home Meridian acquisition in fiscal year 2017 and additional $12 million for the Shenandoah acquisition in fiscal year 2018 with term loans. Principal and interest payments on the borrowed funds were $7.4 million in fiscal 2018 and are expected to be $8.4 million in fiscal 2019 (assuming no interest rate changes). We are subject to interest rate volatility due to the variable interest rates on these term loans. Among other risks, our debt:. §    may limit our flexibility to pursue other strategic opportunities or react to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and, consequently, place us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors with less debt;. §    will require a portion of our cash flows from operations to be used for debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments and other general corporate purposes;. §    may result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in market interest rates for both long - term debt as well as any borrowings under our line of credit at variable rates; and. §    may require that additional terms, conditions or covenants be placed on us.. We may engage in acquisitions and investments in companies, form strategic alliances and pursue new business lines. These activities could disrupt our business, dilute our earnings per share, decrease the value of our common stock and decrease our earnings and liquidity.. We may acquire or invest in businesses such as those that offer complementary products and that we believe offer competitive advantages.  However, we may fail to identify significant liabilities or risks that could negatively affect us or result in our paying more for the acquired company or assets than they are worth.  We may also have difficulty assimilating and integrating the operations and personnel of an acquired business into our current operations.  Acquisitions may disrupt or distract management from our ongoing business.  We may pay for future acquisitions using cash, stock, the assumption of debt, or a combination of these.  Future acquisitions could result in dilution to existing shareholders and to earnings per share and decrease the value of our common stock. We may pursue new business lines in which we have limited or no prior experience or expertise. These pursuits may require substantial investment of capital and personnel. New business initiatives may fail outright or fail to produce an adequate return, which could adversely affect our earnings, financial condition and liquidity.. 12. Table of Contents. A disruption affecting our domestic facilities could disrupt our business.. The warehouses in which we store our inventory in Virginia, North Carolina and California are critical to our success. Our corporate and divisional headquarters, which house our administration, sourcing, sales, finance, merchandising, customer service and logistics functions for our imported and domestic products are located in Virginia and North Carolina. Our domestic upholstery manufacturing facilities are located in Virginia and North Carolina. Any disruption affecting our domestic facilities, for even a relatively short period of time, could adversely affect our ability to ship our imported furniture products and disrupt our business, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.. Our pension and other defined benefit retirement plan obligations could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows.. We maintain three defined benefit pension plans (the \"Plans\"):. §    a supplemental retirement income plan (\"SRIP\") for certain former and current executives of Hooker Furniture Corporation;. §    the Pulaski Furniture Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (\"SERP\") for certain former executives; and. §    the Pulaski Furniture Corporation Pension Plan (\"Pension Plan\") for former Pulaski Furniture Corporation employees.. The Pension Plan and SERP were liabilities we assumed upon completion of the Home Meridian acquisition on February 1, 2016.. The recognition of costs and liabilities associated with these plans for financial reporting purposes is affected by assumptions made by management and used by actuaries engaged by us to calculate the benefit obligations and the expenses recognized for these plans. The inputs used in developing the required estimates are calculated using a number of assumptions, which represent management's best estimate of the future. The assumptions that have the most significant impact on reported results are (i) the discount rate, (ii) the estimated long-term return on plan assets (for the Pension Plan) and (iii) mortality rates.. While the plans are frozen and no new participants are being added, we expect to be impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions of all three plans and by the investment performance and the funded status of the Pension Plan, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. Should we decide to terminate the Pension Plan in the future, we expect to record settlement expenses against our earnings and contribute a final cash contribution, which could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. See Note 11 on page F-26 for additional information about our pension plans.. Failure to anticipate or timely respond to changes in fashion and consumer tastes could adversely impact our business.. Furniture is a styled product and is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer tastes, as well as to increasingly shorter product life cycles.  If we fail to anticipate or promptly respond to these changes we may lose market share or be faced with the decision of whether to sell excess inventory at reduced prices.  This could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.. Fluctuations in the price, availability or quality of raw materials for our domestically manufactured upholstered furniture could cause manufacturing delays, adversely affect our ability to provide goods to our customers or increase our costs.. We use various types of wood, leather, fabric, foam and other filling material, high carbon spring steel, bar and wire stock and other raw materials in manufacturing upholstered furniture.  We depend on outside suppliers for raw materials and must obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials from these suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner.  We do not have long-term supply contracts with our suppliers.  Unfavorable fluctuations in the price, quality or availability of required raw materials could negatively affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers.  We may not always be able to pass price increases in raw materials through to our customers due to competition and other market pressures. The inability to meet customers' demands or recover higher costs could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.. 13. Table of Contents. If demand for our domestically manufactured upholstered furniture declines we may respond by realigning manufacturing.. Our domestic manufacturing operations make only upholstered furniture.  A decline in demand for our domestically produced upholstered furniture could result in the realignment of our domestic manufacturing operations and capabilities and the implementation of cost-saving measures. These programs could include the consolidation and integration of facilities, functions, systems and procedures.  We may decide to source certain products from other suppliers instead of continuing to manufacture them.  These realignments and cost-saving measures typically involve initial upfront costs and could result in decreases in our near-term earnings before the expected cost savings are realized, if they are realized at all.  We may not always accomplish these actions as quickly as anticipated and may not achieve the expected cost savings, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.. We may experience impairment of our long-lived assets, which would decrease our earnings and net worth.. Accounting rules require that long-lived assets be tested for impairment when circumstances indicate, but at least annually.  At January 28, 2018 we had $107.4 million in net long-lived assets, consisting primarily of property, plant and equipment, trademarks, trade names and goodwill. The outcome of impairment testing could result in the write-down of all or a portion of the value of these assets.  A write-down of our assets would, in turn, reduce our earnings and net worth. See Notes 7 and 8 for additional information.. We may not be able to maintain or raise prices in response to inflation and increasing costs.. Competitive and market forces could prohibit future successful price increases for our products in order to offset increased costs of finished goods, raw materials, freight and other product-related costs, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.. Economic downturns could result in decreased sales, earnings and liquidity.. The furniture industry is particularly sensitive to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects.  Home furnishings are generally considered a postponable purchase by most consumers.  Economic downturns could affect consumer spending habits by decreasing the overall demand for home furnishings.  Changes in interest rates, consumer confidence, new housing starts, existing home sales, the availability of consumer credit and broader national or geopolitical factors have particularly significant effects on our business. A recovery in our sales could lag significantly behind a general recovery in the economy after an economic downturn, due to, among other things, the postponable nature and relatively significant cost of home furnishings purchases. These events could also impact retailers, our primary customers, possibly adversely affecting our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.. We may lose market share due to competition.. The furniture industry is very competitive and fragmented.  We compete with numerous domestic and non-U.S. residential furniture sources.  Some competitors have greater financial resources than we have and often offer extensively advertised, well-recognized, branded products.  Competition from non-U.S. sources has increased dramatically over the past decade.  We may not be able to meet price competition or otherwise respond to competitive pressures, including increases in supplier and production costs.  Also, due to the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings, we may not be able to continue to differentiate our products (through value and styling, finish and other construction techniques) from those of our competitors.  In addition, some large furniture retailers are sourcing directly from non-U.S. furniture factories. Over time, this practice may expand to smaller retailers.  As a result, we are continually subject to the risk of losing market share, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity.. We may incur higher employee costs in the future.. We maintain self-insured healthcare and workers compensation plans for our employees. We have insurance coverage in place for aggregate claims above a specified amount in any year for both plans. While our healthcare costs in recent years have generally increased at the same rate or greater than the national average, those costs have increased more rapidly than general inflation in the U.S. economy. Continued inflation in healthcare costs, as well as additional costs we may incur as a result of current or future federal or state healthcare legislation and regulations, could significantly increase our employee healthcare costs in the future. Our workers compensation claims costs have been insignificant to our overall results of operations for quite some time; however, these costs may increase in the future without warning. Continued increases in our healthcare costs and increased workers compensation claims costs could adversely affect our earnings, financial condition and liquidity.. 14. Table of Contents. Our results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of our results of operations for a full year.. Home furnishings sales fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to factors such as changes in economic and competitive conditions, seasonality, weather conditions and changes in consumer order patterns. From time to time, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, volatility with respect to demand for our home furnishing products. Accordingly, our results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for a full year.. Future costs of complying with various laws and regulations may adversely impact future operating results.. Our business is subject to various domestic and international laws and regulations that could have a significant impact on our operations and the cost to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely impact our sales, earnings, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, failure to comply with such laws and regulations, even inadvertently, could produce negative consequences which could adversely impact our operations and reputation."
