[1] "Item 1A.  Risk Factors. An investment in our common stock contains a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risk factors before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. Our business, including our operating results and financial condition, could be harmed by any of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in our filings with the SEC, including our financial statements and related notes.. Risks Related to Our Business. We may incur losses if we are unable to successfully manage interest rate risk.. Our profitability depends to a large extent on Capital City Bank's net interest income, which is the difference between income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and expense on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. We are unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond our control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, federal funds target rate, money supply, domestic and international events and changes in the United States and other financial markets. Our net interest income may be reduced if: (i) more interest-earning assets than interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature during a time when interest rates are declining or (ii) more interest-bearing liabilities than interest-earning assets reprice or mature during a time when interest rates are rising.. Changes in the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates may also harm our business. We generally use short-term deposits to fund longer-term assets. When interest rates change, assets and liabilities with shorter terms reprice more quickly than those with longer terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our net interest margin. If market interest rates rise rapidly, interest rate adjustment caps may also limit increases in the interest rates on adjustable rate loans, which could further reduce our net interest income. Additionally, we believe that due to the recent historical low interest rate environment, the effects of the repeal of Regulation Q, which previously had prohibited the payment of interest on demand deposits by member banks of the Federal Reserve System, has not been realized. The increased price competition for deposits that may result upon the return to a historically normal interest rate environment could adversely affect net interest margins of community banks.. Although we continuously monitor interest rates and have a number of tools to manage our interest rate risk exposure, changes in market assumptions regarding future interest rates could significantly impact our interest rate risk strategy, our financial position and results of operations. If we do not properly monitor our interest rate risk management strategies, these activities may not effectively mitigate our interest rate sensitivity or have the desired impact on our results of operations or financial condition.. Our loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss which could lead to higher loan losses and nonperforming assets.. We originate commercial real estate loans, commercial loans, construction loans, vacant land loans, consumer loans, and residential mortgage loans primarily within our market area. Commercial real estate, commercial, construction, vacant land, and consumer loans may expose a lender to greater credit risk than traditional fixed-rate fully amortizing loans secured by single-family residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily as single-family residential real estate. In addition, these loan types tend to involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers and are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle. These loans also have historically had greater credit risk than other loans for the following reasons:.          Commercial Real Estate Loans. Repayment is dependent on income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. These loans also involve greater risk because they are generally not fully amortizing over the loan period, but rather have a balloon payment due at maturity. A borrower's ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on the borrower's ability to either refinance the loan or timely sell the underlying property. As of December 31, 2017, commercial mortgage loans comprised approximately 32.3% of our total loan portfolio..          Commercial Loans. Repayment is generally dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower's business. In addition, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, be difficult to appraise, be illiquid, or fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. As of December 31, 2017, commercial loans comprised approximately 13.2% of our total loan portfolio.. 20.          Construction Loans. The risk of loss is largely dependent on our initial estimate of whether the property's value at completion equals or exceeds the cost of property construction and the availability of take-out financing. During the construction phase, a number of factors can result in delays or cost overruns. If our estimate is inaccurate or if actual construction costs exceed estimates, the value of the property securing our loan may be insufficient to ensure full repayment when completed through a permanent loan, sale of the property, or by seizure of collateral. As of December 31, 2017, construction loans comprised approximately 4.7% of our total loan portfolio..          Vacant Land Loans. Because vacant or unimproved land is generally held by the borrower for investment purposes or future use, payments on loans secured by vacant or unimproved land will typically rank lower in priority to the borrower than a loan the borrower may have on their primary residence or business. These loans are susceptible to adverse conditions in the real estate market and local economy. As of December 31, 2017, vacant land loans comprised approximately 3.2% of our total loan portfolio..          HELOCs. Our open-ended home equity loans have an interest-only draw period followed by a five-year repayment period of 0.75% of the principal balance monthly and a balloon payment at maturity. Upon the commencement of the repayment period, the monthly payment can increase significantly, thus, there is a heightened risk that the borrower will be unable to pay the increased payment. Further, these loans also involve greater risk because they are generally not fully amortizing over the loan period, but rather have a balloon payment due at maturity.  A borrower's ability to make a balloon payment may depend on the borrower's ability to either refinance the loan or timely sell the underlying property.  As of December 31, 2017, HELOCs comprised approximately 13.8% of our total loan portfolio..          Consumer Loans. Consumer loans (such as automobile loans and personal lines of credit) are collateralized, if at all, with assets that may not provide an adequate source of payment of the loan due to depreciation, damage, or loss. As of December 31, 2017, consumer loans comprised approximately 16.9% of our total loan portfolio, with indirect auto loans making up a majority of this portfolio at approximately 87% of the total balance.. The increased risks associated with these types of loans result in a correspondingly higher probability of default on such loans (as compared to fixed-rate fully amortizing single-family real estate loans). Loan defaults would likely increase our loan losses and nonperforming assets and could adversely affect our allowance for loan losses and our results of operations.. We process, maintain, and transmit confidential client information through our information technology systems, such as our online banking service.  Cybersecurity issues, such as security breaches and computer viruses, affecting our information technology systems or fraud related to our debit card products could disrupt our business, result in the unintended disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs, and cause losses.. We collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our clients, and personally identifiable information of our clients and employees, in our information technology systems. We also provide our clients the ability to bank online. The secure processing, maintenance, and transmission of this information is critical to our operations.  Our network, or those of our clients, could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security problems.  Financial institutions and companies engaged in data processing have increasingly reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage.. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. Security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing clients to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to generate deposits.. Additionally, fraud losses related to debit and credit cards have risen in recent years due in large part to growing and evolving schemes to illegally use cards or steal consumer credit card information despite risk management practices employed by the debit and credit card industries. Many issuers of debit and credit cards have suffered significant losses in recent years due to the theft of cardholder data that has been illegally exploited for personal gain.. The potential for debit and credit card fraud against us or our clients and our third party service providers is a serious issue. Debit and credit card fraud is pervasive and the risks of cybercrime are complex and continue to evolve. In view of the recent high-profile retail data breaches involving client personal and financial information, the potential impact on us and any exposure to consumer losses and the cost of technology investments to improve security could cause losses to us or our clients, damage to our brand, and an increase in our costs.. 21. An inadequate allowance for loan losses would reduce our earnings.. We are exposed to the risk that our clients may be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure full repayment. This could result in credit losses that are inherent in the lending business. We evaluate the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate based upon such factors as:.          the risk characteristics of various classifications of loans;.          previous loan loss experience;.          specific loans that have loss potential;.          delinquency trends;.          estimated fair market value of the collateral;.          current economic conditions; and.          geographic and industry loan concentrations.. As of December 31, 2017, our allowance for loan losses was $13.3 million, which represented approximately 0.80% of our total loans. We had $7.2 million in nonaccruing loans as of December 31, 2017. The allowance is based on management's reasonable estimate and may not prove sufficient to cover future loan losses. Although management uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used or adverse developments arise with respect to our nonperforming or performing loans. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our estimated losses on loans. Our regulators may require us to recognize additional losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Accordingly, the allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover all future loan losses and significant increases to the allowance may be required in the future if, for example, economic conditions worsen. A material increase in our allowance for loan losses would adversely impact our net income and capital in future periods, while having the effect of overstating our current period earnings.. We may incur significant costs associated with the ownership of real property as a result of foreclosures, which could reduce our net income.. Since we originate loans secured by real estate, we may have to foreclose on the collateral property to protect our investment and may thereafter own and operate such property, in which case we would be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate.. The amount that we, as a mortgagee, may realize after a foreclosure is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to:.          general or local economic conditions;.          environmental cleanup liability;.          neighborhood values;.          interest rates;.          real estate tax rates;.          operating expenses of the mortgaged properties;.          supply of and demand for rental units or properties;.          ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties;.          zoning laws;.          governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies; and.          acts of God.. Certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, including real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, may adversely affect the income from the real estate. Furthermore, we may need to advance funds to continue to operate or to protect these assets. As a result, the cost of operating real property assets may exceed the rental income earned from such properties or we may be required to dispose of the real property at a loss.. 22. Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.. Effective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business. We require sufficient liquidity to meet client loan requests, client deposit maturities and withdrawals, payments on our debt obligations as they come due and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and other unpredictable circumstances causing industry or general financial market stress. If we are unable to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, earnings and other sources, it could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity.  In particular, a majority of our liabilities during 2017 were checking accounts and other liquid deposits, which are generally payable on demand or upon short notice. By comparison, a substantial majority of our assets were loans, which cannot generally be called or sold in the same time frame. Although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary, we might not be able to replace such funds in the future, especially if a large number of our depositors seek to withdraw their accounts at the same time, regardless of the reason. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could negatively impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated, adverse regulatory action against us, or our inability to attract and retain deposits. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. If we are unable to maintain adequate liquidity, it could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.. Our future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry.. We face vigorous competition for deposits, loans and other financial services in our market area from other banks and financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, savings banks, finance companies and credit unions. A number of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have greater access to capital and other resources. Many of our competitors also have higher lending limits, more expansive branch networks, and offer a wider array of financial products and services. To a lesser extent, we also compete with other providers of financial services, such as money market mutual funds, brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, insurance companies and governmental organizations, which may offer financial products and services on more favorable terms than we are able to. Many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern our activities. As a result, these non-bank competitors have advantages over us in providing certain services. The effect of this competition may reduce or limit our margins or our market share and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.. Risks Related to Regulation and Legislation. We are subject to extensive regulation, which could restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business.. We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by our regulators, including the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC. Our compliance with these industry regulations is costly and restricts certain of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, lending and interest rates charged on loans, interest rates paid on deposits, access to capital and brokered deposits and locations of banking offices. If we are unable to meet these regulatory requirements, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.. Our activities are also regulated under consumer protection laws applicable to our lending, deposit and other activities. Many of these regulations are intended primarily for the protection of our depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the benefit of our shareowners. In addition to the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank, we must also comply with applicable regulations of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Federal Home Loan Bank.. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith effort or results from a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base and the price of our securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial condition. Please refer to the Section entitled \"Business  -  Regulatory Considerations\" in this Report.. Legislative and administrative action may affect our business.. President Donald Trump and others in Congress called for substantial change to several regulations and policies, which may include the repeal of regulations implemented as a result of Dodd-Frank and comprehensive tax reform. We cannot predict the impact, if any, of these changes to our business. However, it is possible that these changes could adversely affect our business. It is likely that some policies adopted by the new administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us. Until we know what changes are enacted, if any, we will not know whether in total we benefit from, or are negatively affected by, the changes.. 23. The increased capital requirements may have an adverse effect on us.. In 2013, the Federal Reserve Board released its final rules which implement in the United States the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the final rule, minimum requirements increased for both the quality and quantity of capital held by banking organizations. Consistent with the international Basel framework, the rule includes a new minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (\"CET1\") to Risk-Weighted Assets (\"RWA\") of 4.5% and a CET1 conservation buffer of 2.5% of RWA (which will be phased in from 2016 through 2019) that apply to all supervised financial institutions. As of January 1, 2018, the CET1conservation buffer requirement was 1.875%, which requires us to hold additional CET1 capital in excess of the minimum required to meet the CET1 to RWA ratio requirement. The rule also, among other things, raised the minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to RWA from 4% to 6% and included a minimum leverage ratio of 4% for all banking organizations. The impact of the new capital rules requires us to maintain higher levels of capital, which we expect will lower our return on equity. Additionally, if our CET1 to RWA ratio does not exceed the minimum required plus the additional CET1 conservation buffer, we may be restricted in our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions of capital to our shareowners.. Compliance with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's ability-to-repay rule safe-harbor could adversely impact our growth or profitability.. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a rule, effective as of January 10, 2014, designed to clarify for lenders how they can avoid monetary damages under the Dodd-Frank Act, which holds lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower's ability to repay a mortgage at the time the loan is originated. Loans that satisfy the \"qualified mortgage\" safe-harbor will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. Under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule, a \"qualified mortgage\" loan must not contain certain specified features, including but not limited to:.          excessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less \"bona fide discount points\" for prime loans);.          interest-only payments;.          negative-amortization; and.          terms longer than 30 years.. Also, to qualify as a \"qualified mortgage,\" a borrower's total monthly debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule on qualified mortgages could limit our ability or desire to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive and/or time consuming to make these loans, which could adversely impact our growth or profitability.. Florida financial institutions, such as the Bank, face a higher risk of noncompliance and enforcement actions with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.. Since September 11, 2001, banking regulators have intensified their focus on anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance requirements, particularly the anti-money laundering provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\"). Since 2004, federal banking regulators and examiners have been extremely aggressive in their supervision and examination of financial institutions located in the State of Florida with respect to the institution's Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering compliance. Consequently, numerous formal enforcement actions have been instituted against financial institutions.. In order to comply with regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in this area, the Bank has been required to adopt new policies and procedures and to install new systems. If the Bank's policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that it has already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, the Bank would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on its ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of its business plan, including its acquisition plans.. 24. Risks Related to Market Events. Our loan portfolio is heavily concentrated in mortgage loans secured by properties in Florida and Georgia which causes our risk of loss to be higher than if we had a more geographically diversified portfolio.. Our interest-earning assets are heavily concentrated in mortgage loans secured by real estate, particularly real estate located in Florida and Georgia.  As of December 31, 2017, approximately 70% of our loans included real estate as a primary, secondary, or tertiary component of collateral. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower; however, the value of the collateral may decline during the time the credit is extended. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan during a period of reduced real estate values to satisfy the debt, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected.. Additionally, as of December 31, 2017, substantially all of our loans secured by real estate are secured by commercial and residential properties located in Northern Florida and Middle Georgia. The concentration of our loans in these areas subjects us to risk that a downturn in the economy or recession in these areas could result in a decrease in loan originations and increases in delinquencies and foreclosures, which would more greatly affect us than if our lending were more geographically diversified. In addition, since a large portion of our portfolio is secured by properties located in Florida and Georgia, the occurrence of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, or a man-made disaster could result in a decline in loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction of mortgaged properties and an increase in the risk of delinquencies, foreclosures or loss on loans originated by us. We may suffer further losses due to the decline in the value of the properties underlying our mortgage loans, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.. Our concentration in loans secured by real estate may increase our credit losses, which would negatively affect our financial results.. Due to the lack of diversified industry within the markets served by the Bank and the relatively close proximity of our geographic markets, we have both geographic concentrations as well as concentrations in the types of loans funded. Specifically, due to the nature of our markets, a significant portion of the portfolio has historically been secured with real estate. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 32% and 33% of our $1.653 billion loan portfolio was secured by commercial real estate and residential real estate, respectively. As of this same date, approximately 5% was secured by property under construction.. In the event we are required to foreclose on a property securing one of our mortgage loans or otherwise pursue our remedies in order to protect our investment, we may be unable to recover funds in an amount equal to our projected return on our investment or in an amount sufficient to prevent a loss to us due to prevailing economic conditions, real estate values and other factors associated with the ownership of real property. As a result, the market value of the real estate or other collateral underlying our loans may not, at any given time, be sufficient to satisfy the outstanding principal amount of the loans, and consequently, we would sustain loan losses.. The fair value of our investments could decline which would cause a reduction in shareowners' equity.. A large portion of our investment securities portfolio as of December 31, 2017 has been designated as available-for-sale pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles relating to accounting for investments. Such principles require that unrealized gains and losses in the estimated value of the available-for-sale portfolio be \"marked to market\" and reflected as a separate item in shareowners' equity (net of tax) as accumulated other comprehensive income/loss. Shareowners' equity will continue to reflect the unrealized gains and losses (net of tax) of these investments. The fair value of our investment portfolio may decline, causing a corresponding decline in shareowners' equity.. Management believes that several factors will affect the fair values of our investment portfolio. These include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates or expectations of changes in interest rates, the degree of volatility in the securities markets, inflation rates or expectations of inflation and the slope of the interest rate yield curve (the yield curve refers to the differences between short-term and long-term interest rates; a positively sloped yield curve means short-term rates are lower than long-term rates). These and other factors may impact specific categories of the portfolio differently, and we cannot predict the effect these factors may have on any specific category.. 25. Risks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock. We may be unable to pay dividends in the future.. In 2017, our Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends. Declarations of any future dividends will be contingent on our ability to earn sufficient profits and to remain well capitalized, including our ability to hold and generate sufficient capital to comply with the new CET1 conservation buffer requirement. In addition, due to our contractual obligations with the holders of our trust preferred securities, if we defer the payment of accrued interest owed to the holders of our trust preferred securities, we may not make dividend payments to our shareowners.. Further, under applicable statutes and regulations, CCB's board of directors, after charging-off bad debts, depreciation and other worthless assets, if any, and making provisions for reasonably anticipated future losses on loans and other assets, may quarterly, semi-annually, or annually declare and pay dividends to CCBG of up to the aggregate net income of that period combined with the CCB's retained net income for the preceding two years and, with the approval of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation and Federal Reserve, declare a dividend from retained net income which accrued prior to the preceding two years.  Additional state laws generally applicable to Florida corporations may also limit our ability to declare and pay dividends. Thus, our ability to fund future dividends may be restricted by state and federal laws and regulations.. Limited trading activity for shares of our common stock may contribute to price volatility.. While our common stock is listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, there has historically been limited trading activity in our common stock.  The average daily trading volume of our common stock over the 12-month period ending December 31, 2017 was approximately 23,793 shares. Due to the limited trading activity of our common stock, relativity small trades may have a significant impact on the price of our common stock.. Securities analysts may not initiate coverage or continue to cover our common stock, and this may have a negative impact on its market price.. The trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control over securities analysts and they may not initiate coverage or continue to cover our common stock. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect its market price. If we are covered by securities analysts, and our common stock is the subject of an unfavorable report, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover our Company or fails to publish regular reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which may cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.. Our directors, executive officers, and principal shareowners, if acting together, have substantial control over all matters requiring shareowner approval, including changes of control. Because Mr. William G. Smith, Jr. is a principal shareowner and our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Bank, he has substantial control over all matters on a day to day basis.. Our directors, executive officers, and principal shareowners beneficially owned approximately 33.5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2017.  Our principal shareowners include the Estate of Robert H. Smith, who was the brother of William G. Smith, Jr., our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, which beneficially owns 15.5% of our shares.  William G. Smith, Jr. beneficially owns 20.9% of our shares.  In addition, 2S Partnership beneficially owns 6.2% of our shares, however, its shares were historically deemed to be beneficially owned by Messrs. Smith and Smith. Together, Mr. Smith and the Estate of Robert H. Smith beneficially own approximately 30.2% of our shares.. Accordingly, these directors, executive officers, and principal shareowners, if acting together, may be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our shareowners, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. In addition, because William G. Smith, Jr. is the Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of CCBG and Chairman of the Bank, he has substantial control over all matters on a day-to-day basis, including the nomination and election of directors.. These directors, executive officers, and principal shareowners may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. The concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our shareowners of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our Company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock. You may also have difficulty changing management, the composition of the Board of Directors, or the general direction of our Company.. 26. Our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, and certain laws and regulations may prevent or delay transactions you might favor, including a sale or merger of CCBG.. CCBG is registered with the Federal Reserve as a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act (\"BHCA\"). As a result, we are subject to supervisory regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the BHCA, and other federal laws subject financial holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations.. Provisions of our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, certain laws and regulations and various other factors may make it more difficult and expensive for companies or persons to acquire control of us without the consent of our Board of Directors. It is possible, however, that you would want a takeover attempt to succeed because, for example, a potential buyer could offer a premium over the then prevailing price of our common stock.. For example, our Articles of Incorporation permit our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareowner action. The ability to issue preferred stock could discourage a company from attempting to obtain control of us by means of a tender offer, merger, proxy contest or otherwise. Additionally, our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws divide our Board of Directors into three classes, as nearly equal in size as possible, with staggered three-year terms. One class is elected each year. The classification of our Board of Directors could make it more difficult for a company to acquire control of us. We are also subject to certain provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act and our Articles of Incorporation that relate to business combinations with interested shareowners. Other provisions in our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws that may discourage takeover attempts or make them more difficult include:.          Supermajority voting requirements to remove a director from office;.          Provisions regarding the timing and content of shareowner proposals and nominations;.          Supermajority voting requirements to amend Articles of Incorporation unless approval is received by a majority of \"disinterested directors\";.          Absence of cumulative voting; and.          Inability for shareowners to take action by written consent.. Shares of our common stock are not an insured deposit and may lose value.. The shares of our common stock are not a bank deposit and will not be insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. Your investment will be subject to investment risk, and you must be capable of affording the loss of your entire investment."
