[1] "ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORS. Investing in our common shares involves risks. Prior to making a decision about investing in our common shares, you should consider carefully the factors discussed below and the information contained in this Annual Report. Each of these risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and cause the value of our common shares to decline, which may result in the loss of part or all of your investment.. Our exclusive license to provide water to retail customers in the Cayman Islands may not be renewed in the future.. In the Cayman Islands, we provide water to retail customers under a license issued in July 1990 by the Cayman Islands government that grants our subsidiary, Cayman Water, the exclusive right to provide water to retail customers within our licensed service area. Pursuant to the license, we have the exclusive right to produce potable water and distribute it by pipeline to our licensed service area, which consists of two of the three most populated areas of Grand Cayman, the Seven Mile Beach and West Bay areas. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we generated approximately 37%, 40% and 40%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues and 50%, 56% and 56%, respectively, of our consolidated gross profit from the retail water operations conducted pursuant to Cayman Water’s exclusive license.. The license was originally scheduled to expire in July 2010 but has been extended several times by the Cayman Islands government in order to provide the parties with additional time to negotiate the terms of a new license agreement. The most recent extension of the license expired on January 31, 2018. We continue to provide water subsequent to January 31, 2018 on the assumption that the license has been further extended to allow the parties to continue negotiations without interruption to an essential service.. In October 2016, the Government of the Cayman Islands passed legislation which created a new utilities regulation and competition office (“OfReg”). OfReg is an independent and accountable regulatory body with a view of protecting the rights of consumers, encouraging affordable utility services, and promoting competition. OfReg, which began operations in January 2017, has the ability to supervise, monitor and regulate multiple utility undertakings and markets. Supplemental legislation was passed by the Government of the Cayman Islands which transferred responsibility for economic regulation of the water utility sector and the retail license negotiations from the WAC to OfReg in May 2017. We began license negotiations with OfReg for a new retail license in July 2017 and such negotiations continue.. The resolution of these license negotiations could result in a material reduction of the operating income and cash flows we have historically generated from our retail operations and could require us to record an impairment loss to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill. Such impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.. Our bulk water supply agreements in the Cayman Islands may not be renewed or may be renewed on terms less favorable to us.. All of our bulk water supply agreements are for fixed terms, and such agreements for plants that we operate but are owned by our customers provide for our customers to take over the operations of the plant upon expiration of the agreements.. Our bulk water supply agreements with the WAC for their North Sound and Red Gate plants expire in July 2018 and July 2018, respectively. Our bulk water supply agreement with the WAC for their North Side Water Works plant expires in June 2019.. We generated total revenues of approximately $7.2 million from these three plants during the year ended December 31, 2017.. If our bulk water supply agreements are not renewed or are renewed on terms less favorable to us, our results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected, and we could be required to record an impairment loss to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill. Such impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.. We have paid $21.7 million for land, rights of way and equipment and incurred development expenses of approximately $23.5 million to date for a possible project in Mexico. We expect to expend significant additional funds in 2018 to continue to pursue this project. However, we may not be successful in completing this project.. 16. We own 99.99% of N.S.C. Agua, S.A. de C.V. (“NSC”), a development stage Mexico company formed to pursue a project encompassing the construction, operation and minority ownership of a 100 million gallon per day seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant to be located in northern Baja California, Mexico and an accompanying pipeline to deliver water to the Mexican potable water system (the “Project”). As of December 31, 2017, our consolidated balance sheet includes purchases for the Project of approximately $21.7 million for land, rights of way and equipment. The Project development activities we have conducted, which include conducting an equipment piloting plant and water data collection program at the proposed feed water source, completing various engineering studies and obtaining various governmental permits, have resulted in additional developmental expenses totaling $23.5 million from 2010 through December 31, 2017.. In August 2014, the State of Baja California (the “State”) enacted new legislation to regulate Public-Private Association projects which involve the type of long-term contract between a public-sector authority and a private party that NSC is seeking to complete the Project. Pursuant to this new legislation, in November 2015 the State officially commenced a tender process for the Project, the scope of which the State defined as a first phase to be operational in 2019 consisting of a 50 million gallon per day plant and a pipeline that connects to the Mexican potable water infrastructure and a second phase to be operational in 2024 consisting of an additional 50 million gallons per day of production capacity. A consortium comprised of NSC, NuWater S.A.P.I. de C.V. and Degremont S.A. de C.V. (the “Consortium”) submitted its tender for the Project in April 2016 and in June 2016, the State designated the Consortium as the winner of tender process for the Project.. Due to the amount of capital the Project requires, NSC will ultimately need an equity partner or partners for the Project. Consequently, NSC’s tender to the State for the Project was based upon the following: (i) NSC will sell or otherwise transfer the land and other Project assets to a new company (“Newco”) that would build and own the Project; (ii) NSC’s potential partners would provide the majority of the equity for the Project and thereby would own the majority interest in Newco; (iii) NSC would maintain a minority ownership position in Newco; and (iv) Newco would enter into a long-term management and technical services contract for the Project with an entity partially owned by NSC or another Company subsidiary.. On August 17, 2016, NSC and NuWater incorporated Newco under the name Aguas de Rosarito S.A.P.I. de C.V. (“AdR”), a special purpose company, to complete the Project and executed a shareholders agreement agreeing among other things that: (i) AdR would purchase the land and other Project assets from NSC on the date that the Project begins commercial operation and (ii) AdR would enter into a Management and Technical Services Agreement with NSC effective on the first day that the Project begins commercial operation. As of December 31, 2017, NSC owned 99.6% of AdR.. On August 22, 2016, the Public Private Partnership Agreement for public private partnership number 002/2015, contest number SIDUE-CEA-APP-2015-002 (“APP Contract”), was executed between AdR, the State Water Commission of Baja California (“CEA”), the Government of Baja California represented by the Secretary of Planning and Finance and the Public Utilities Commission of Tijuana (“CESPT”). The APP Contract requires AdR to design, construct, finance and operate a seawater desalination plant (and accompanying aqueducts) with a capacity of up to 100 million gallons per day in two phases: the first with a capacity of 50 million gallons per day and an aqueduct to the Mexican potable water system in Tijuana, Baja California; and the second phase with a capacity of 50 million gallons per day and an aqueduct to a second delivery point in Tijuana. The first phase must be operational within 36 months of commencing construction and the second phase must be operational by the end of 2024. The APP Contract further requires AdR to operate and maintain the plant and aqueducts for a period of 37 years starting from the commencement of operation of the first phase. At the end of the operating period, the plant and aqueducts will be transferred to CEA. The total cost for Phase 1 of the Project is presently estimated at approximately 9.1 billion Mexican pesos.. The APP Contract does not become effective until the following conditions are met:. ·the                                          State has established and registered various payment trusts, guaranties and bank credit                                          lines for specific use by the Project;. ·the                                          CEA has obtained the rights from the relevant federal authority to take and desalinate                                          seawater and distribute it for municipal use;. ·various                                          agreements between the CEA, the payment trusts and the CESPT have been executed;. 17. ·AdR                                          has obtained all of the rights of way required for the Phase 1 aqueduct;. ·AdR                                          has obtained permission from the relevant federal authority to discharge the residual                                          water from the Project’s desalination plant; and. ·all debt financing agreements necessary to provide the funding to AdR for the                                                                                                           first phase of the Project have been executed.. Both the exchange rate for the Mexico peso relative to the dollar and general macroeconomic conditions in Mexico have varied since the execution of the APP Contract. These changes could adversely impact the estimated construction, operating, and financing costs for the Project. The APP Contract and the APP Law allow for the parties to negotiate (but do not guarantee) modifications to the water tariff in the event of such significant macroeconomic condition changes. In February 2017, AdR submitted proposals to the CEA requesting an increase to the water tariff to compensate for changes in foreign exchange rates, lending rates and certain changes in law which have impacted the Project. If AdR is unable to obtain this requested increase in the water tariff, it may be unable to obtain the debt and equity financing required for the Project. We are currently unable to determine whether or not such water tariff increase will be approved.. In February 2018, AdR executed a subscription agreement (the “Agreement”) for the equity funding required for the Project. The Agreement calls for NSC to retain a minimum of 25% of the equity in AdR. One or more affiliates of Greenfield SPV VII, S.A.P.I. de C.V. (“Greenfield”), a Mexico company managed by an affiliate of a leading U.S. asset manager, will acquire a minimum of 55% of AdR. The Agreement also provides Suez Medio Ambiente México, S.A. de C.V., (“Suez”) a subsidiary of SUEZ International, S.A.S., with the option to purchase 20% of the equity of AdR. If Suez does not exercise this option, NSC will retain 35% of the equity of AdR and Greenfield will acquire 65% of the equity of AdR. The Agreement will become effective when the additional conditions related to the Project are met, including but not limited to those conditions discussed previously with respect to this risk factor. The aggregate investment to be made by the equity partners in the Project, in the form of equity and subordinated shareholder loans, is presently estimated at approximately 20% of the total cost of Phase 1 of the Project.. If AdR is ultimately unable to proceed with the Project, the land NSC has purchased and the right of way deposits may lose their strategic importance derived from their association with the Project and consequently may decline in value. If AdR does not proceed with the Project, NSC may ultimately be unable to sell this land or recoup its right of way deposits for amounts at least equal to their current carrying values of approximately $20.6 million and $947,000, respectively. Any loss on the sale of the land, or impairment losses NSC may be required to record as a result of a decrease in the (i) fair value of the land; or (ii) value of the rights of way arising from the inability to complete the Project could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.. We have been required to record impairment losses to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill arising from our acquisition of Aerex in February 2016. If Aerex’s future financial performance falls short of our most recent financial projections for this subsidiary, we may be required to record additional impairment losses to reduce the carrying value of this goodwill.. In February 2016, we acquired a 51% ownership interest in Aerex. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded initial goodwill of $8,035,211. Aerex’s actual results of operations in the six months following our acquisition of this company fell significantly short of the projected results that were included in the overall cash flow projections we utilized to determine the purchase price for Aerex and the fair values of its assets and liabilities. Due to this shortfall in Aerex’s results of operations, we updated our projections for Aerex’s future cash flows and tested Aerex’s goodwill for possible impairment as of September 30, 2016 by estimating its fair value using the discounted cash flow method. As a result of this impairment testing, we determined that the carrying value of our Aerex goodwill exceeded its fair value and recorded an impairment loss of $1,750,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 to reduce the carrying value of this goodwill to $6,285,211. As part of our annual impairment testing of goodwill performed during the fourth quarter of each year, we updated our projections for Aerex’s future cash flows, determined that the carrying value of our Aerex goodwill exceeded its fair value, and recorded an impairment loss of $1,400,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 to further reduce the carrying value of this goodwill to $4,885,211. We may be required to record additional impairment losses to reduce the carrying value of our Aerex goodwill in future periods if we determine it likely that Aerex’s results of operations will fall short of our most recent projections of its future cash flows. Such impairment losses could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.. We presently have a limited ability to transfer funds from our Belize subsidiary. If this situation continues, our overall liquidity could be adversely affected in the future.. Transfers of funds held by our subsidiary CW-Belize to our parent company, which are accomplished by means of conversion of Belize dollars into U.S. dollars, require the approval of the Central Bank of Belize and are dependent on the amount of U.S. dollars available to Belize banks to execute such transfers. Weakness in the Belize economy and other factors have reduced the amount of U.S. dollars that Belize banks have available for transfer, which has limited the amount of funds we are presently able to transfer from CW-Belize. Our repatriations of funds from CW-Belize to our parent company amounted to $458,000 and $400,000 in 2017 and 2016, respectively, significantly less than the net income and net cash flows CW-Belize generated for those years. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the equivalent U.S. dollar cash amounts for our bank account deposits in Belize were approximately $6.3 million and $4.9 million, respectively.. We cannot presently determine when we will have an improved ability to transfer funds from CW-Belize. While we presently have sufficient liquidity from other sources, should we need to access our cash balances held by CW-Belize in the future to support our other operations, the majority of such funds may not be available for immediate transfer from Belize.. We do not have voting control over our affiliate, OC-BVI. Should our interests and the interests of OC-BVI’s other voting shareholder diverge, the operations of OC-BVI could be adversely affected which could decrease the value of our investment in OC-BVI.. We own 43.53% of the equity and 50% of the voting shares of OC-BVI. We and Sage, which owns the remaining 50% of the voting shares, are each entitled to appoint three of the six directors of OC-BVI. If a tie vote of the directors occurs on any matter, the president of the Caribbean Water and Wastewater Association, a regional trade association comprised primarily of government representatives, is entitled to appoint a temporary director to cast the deciding vote. As a result, although we provide operating management and engineering services to OC-BVI, we share the overall management of OC-BVI with Sage and do not fully control its operations. A divergence of our interests and the interests of Sage could adversely affect the operations of OC-BVI and in turn decrease the value of our investment in OC-BVI, in which case we could be required to record an impairment loss to reduce the carrying value of our investment in OC-BVI. Such an impairment loss would reduce our earnings and could have a material adverse impact on our result of operations and financial condition.. 18. The profitability of our plants is dependent upon our ability to accurately estimate the costs of their construction and operation.. The cost estimates we prepare in connection with the construction and operation of our plants are subject to inherent uncertainties. Additionally, the terms of our supply contracts may require us to guarantee the price of water on a per unit basis, subject to certain annual inflation and monthly energy cost adjustments, and to assume the risk that the costs associated with producing this water may be greater than anticipated. Because we base our contracted price of water in part on our estimation of future construction and operating costs, the profitability of our plants is dependent on our ability to estimate these costs accurately. The cost of materials and services and the cost of the delivery of such services may increase significantly after we submit our bid for a plant, which could cause the gross profit and net return on investment for a plant to be less than we anticipated when the bid was made. The profit margins we initially expect to generate from a plant could be further reduced if future operating costs for that plant exceed our estimates of such costs. These future operating costs could be affected by a variety of factors, including lower than anticipated production efficiencies and geo-hydrological conditions at the plant site that differ materially from those we believe would exist at the time we submitted our bid. Any construction and operating costs for our plants that significantly exceed our initial estimates could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. Possible future regulatory oversight and control could adversely impact our Belize operations.. By Statutory Instrument No. 81 of 2009, the Minister of Public Utilities of the government of Belize published an order, the Public Utility Provider Class Declaration Order, 2009 (the “Order”), which as of May 1, 2009 designated CW-Belize as a public utility provider under the laws of Belize. With this designation, the Public Utilities Commission of Belize (the “PUC”) has the authority to set the rates charged by CW-Belize and to otherwise regulate its activities. On November 1, 2010, CW-Belize received a formal complaint from the PUC alleging that CW-Belize was operating without a license under the terms of the Water Industry Act. CW-Belize applied for this license in December 2010. On July 29, 2011, the PUC issued the San Pedro Public Water Supply Quality and Security Complaint Order (the “Second Order”) which among other things requires that (i) CW-Belize and its customer jointly make a submission to the responsible Minister requesting that the area surrounding CW-Belize’s seawater abstraction wells be designated a forest reserve or national park and be designated a Controlled Area under section 58 of the Water Industry Act, (ii) CW-Belize submit an operations manual for CW-Belize’s desalination plant to the PUC for approval, (iii) CW-Belize and its customer modify the water supply agreement between the parties to (a) include new water quality parameters included in the Order and (b) cap the current exclusive water supply arrangement in the agreement at a maximum of 450,000 gallons per day, (iv) CW-Belize keep a minimum number of replacement seawater RO membranes in stock at all times and (v) CW-Belize take possession of and reimburse the PUC for certain equipment which the PUC purchased from a third-party in late 2010. CW-Belize has applied for declaratory judgment and has been granted a temporary injunction to stay the enforcement of the Second Order by the PUC until such time as the Belize courts could hear the matter. The initial hearing on this matter was conducted on October 30 and 31, 2012 with an additional hearing on November 29, 2012.. On December 8, 2017, we received a favorable ruling from the Supreme Court of Belize stating that (i) the claims by the PUC in the Order and the Second Order were unlawful, null and void and of no effect; and (ii) the PUC is prohibited from taking any steps or proceedings or making any further Order in respect of the said Order. However, on February 20, 2018, the PUC filed an appeal with the Belize Court of Appeal, the results of which are pending. An unfavorable ruling by the Court of Appeal on the Order or the Second Order could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.. A significant portion of our consolidated revenues are derived from our water supply agreements with the WSC. The loss of, or a less favorable relationship with, the WSC could adversely affect us.. One bulk water customer, the WSC, accounted for approximately 34% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. If the WSC becomes unable for financial or other reasons to comply with the terms of our water supply agreements with them, or terminates either of our agreements with them for cause, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.. Our operations are affected by tourism and are subject to seasonal fluctuations that could affect the demand for our water.. Demand for our water in the Cayman Islands, Belize, Bimini and The Bahamas is affected by variations in the level of tourism and local weather, primarily rainfall. Tourism in our service areas is affected by the economies of the tourists’ home countries, primarily the United States and Europe, terrorist activity and perceived threats thereof, and increased costs of fuel and airfares. We normally sell more water during the first and second quarters, when the number of tourists is greater and local rainfall is less, than in the third and fourth quarters. A downturn in tourism or greater than expected rainfall in the locations we serve could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.. 19. We may have difficulty accomplishing our growth strategy within and outside of our current operating areas.. Our expansion both within our current operating areas and into new areas involves significant risks, including, but not limited to, the following:. ·regulatory                                          risks, including government relations difficulties, local regulations, currency controls                                          and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;. ·receiving                                          and maintaining necessary permits, licenses and approvals;. ·political                                          instability, reliance on local economies, environmental problems, shortages of materials,                                          immigration restrictions and limited skilled labor;. ·risks                                          related to development of new operations, including inaccurate assessment of the demand                                          for water, engineering difficulties and inability to begin operations as scheduled; and. ·risks                                          relating to greater competition in these new territories, including the ability of our                                          competitors to gain or retain market share by reducing prices.. Even if we successfully expand our operations, we may have difficulty managing our growth. We cannot assure you that any new operations within or outside of our current operating areas will attain or maintain profitability or that the results from these new operations will not adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.. Performance shortfalls under any of our bulk supply contracts could result in penalties or cancellation of the contract.. Our bulk water supply agreements require us to meet specified minimum quality, quantity or energy consumption guarantees. Membrane fouling or other technical problems could occur at any of our plants, and if we are unable to meet the guarantees due to such operating issues, we could be in technical default of the supply contract and subject to various adverse consequences, including financial penalties or cancellation of the agreement.. Our operations could be harmed by hurricanes or tropical storms.. A hurricane or tropical storm could cause major damage to our equipment and properties and the properties of our customers, including the large tourist properties in our areas of operation. For example, in September 2004 Hurricane Ivan caused significant damage to our plants and our customers’ properties in Grand Cayman which adversely affected our revenues. Any future damage could cause us to lose use of our equipment and properties and incur additional repair costs. Damage to our customers’ properties and the adverse impact on tourism could result in a decrease in water demand. A hurricane or tropical storm could also disrupt the delivery of equipment and supplies, including electricity, necessary to our operations. These and other possible effects of hurricanes or tropical storms could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.. Contamination of our processed water may cause disruption in our services and adversely affect our revenues.. Our processed water may become contaminated by natural occurrences and by inadvertent or intentional human interference, including acts of terrorism. In the event that a portion of our processed water is contaminated, we may have to interrupt the supply of water until we are able to install treatment equipment or substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water production source. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat a contaminated source of plant feed water through expansion of our current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment methods. An inability by us to substitute processed water from an uncontaminated water source or to adequately treat the contaminated plant feed water in a cost-effective manner may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.. Potential government decisions, actions and regulations could negatively affect our operations.. We are subject to the local regulations of the Cayman Islands, Belize, the British Virgin Islands, The Bahamas and Indonesia, all of which are subject to change. Any government that regulates our operations may issue legislation or adopt new regulations, including but not limited to:. ·restricting                                          foreign ownership (by us);. ·providing                                          for the expropriation of our assets by the government;. ·providing                                          for nationalization of public utilities by the government;. ·providing                                          for different water quality standards;. ·unilaterally                                          changing or renegotiating our licenses and agreements;. ·restricting                                          the transfer of U.S. currency; or. ·causing                                          currency exchange fluctuations/devaluations or making changes in tax laws.. As new laws and regulations are issued, we may be required to modify our operations and business strategy, which we may be unable to do in a cost-effective manner. Failure by us to comply with applicable regulations could result in the loss of our licenses or authorizations to operate, the assessment of penalties or fines, or otherwise may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.. 20. We rely on the efforts of key employees. Our failure to retain these employees could adversely affect our results of operations.. Our success depends upon the abilities of our executive officers. In particular, the loss of the services of Frederick W. McTaggart, our President and Chief Executive Officer, could be detrimental to our operations and our continued success. Mr. McTaggart has an employment agreement expiring on December 31, 2020. Each year, the term of this agreement may be extended for an additional year. However, we cannot guarantee that Mr. McTaggart will continue to work for us during the term of his agreement or will enter into any extensions thereof.. We are exposed to credit risk through our relationships with several customers.. We are subject to credit risk posed by possible defaults in payment by our bulk water customers in the Cayman Islands, Belize, the British Virgin Islands and The Bahamas and by possible defaults in payment by the WAC on their loans payable to us. Adverse economic conditions affecting, or financial difficulties of, those parties could impair their ability to pay us or cause them to delay payment. We depend on these parties to pay us on a timely basis. Our outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. Any delay or default in payment could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.. We are exposed to the risk of variations in currency exchange rates.. Although we report our results in United States dollars, the majority of our revenues are earned in other currencies. Although many of these currencies have been fixed to the United States dollar for more than 20 years, other currencies (e.g. the Mexico peso, Indonesian rupiah and the euro) are not. We do not employ hedging strategies against the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with conducting business in foreign currencies while reporting in United States dollars. If any of the fixed exchange rates becomes a floating exchange rate, or the other currencies in which we conduct business depreciate significantly against the United State dollar, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.. We may enter new markets in the future in which we do not have a contractual commitment for our products or existing customers.. Our strategy contemplates potential entry into new markets (such as Mexico and other countries) where we believe a demand for potable water exists beyond the current supply of potable water in those markets. We may incur significant business development expenses in the pursuit of new markets prior to obtaining a contract for services in these markets, and such expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. We may decide to enter such markets by building new reverse osmosis desalination plants before we have obtained a contract for the sale of water produced by the new plant or before we have established a customer base for the water produced by the new plant. If after completing such plant, we are unable to obtain a contract or sufficient number of customers for the plant, we may be unable to recover the cost of our investment in the plant, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.. We may not pay dividends in the future. If dividends are paid, they may be in lesser amounts than past dividends.. Our shareholders may receive dividends out of legally available funds if, and when, they are declared by our Board of Directors. We have paid dividends in the past but may cease to do so at any time. We may incur increased operating or development expenses or capital requirements or additional indebtedness in the future that may restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends. We may also be restricted from paying dividends in the future due to restrictions imposed by applicable corporate laws, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, covenants contained in our financing agreements, and other factors considered by our Board of Directors. We may not continue to pay dividends in the future or, if dividends are paid, they may not be in amounts similar to past dividends.. Service of process and enforcement of legal proceedings commenced against us in the United States may be difficult to obtain.. We are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and substantially all of our assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, seven of our 15 directors and executive officers reside outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to execute service of process within the United States upon us and such other persons, or to enforce judgments obtained against such persons in United States courts, and bring any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States securities laws. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce, in original actions brought in courts or jurisdictions located outside of the United States, rights predicated upon the United States securities laws.. Based on the advice of our Cayman Islands legal counsel, we believe no reciprocal statutory enforcement of foreign judgments exists between the United States and the Cayman Islands, and that foreign judgments originating from the United States are not directly enforceable in the Cayman Islands. A prevailing party in a United States proceeding against us or our officers or directors would have to initiate a new proceeding in the Cayman Islands using the United States judgment as evidence of the party’s claim. A prevailing party could rely on the summary judgment procedures available in the Cayman Islands, subject to available defenses in the Cayman Islands courts, including, but not limited to, the lack of competent jurisdiction in the United States courts, lack of due service of process in the United States proceeding and the possibility that enforcement or recognition of the United States judgment would be contrary to the public policy of the Cayman Islands.. 21. Depending on the nature of damages awarded, civil liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (or the Securities Act), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (or the Exchange Act), for original actions instituted outside the Cayman Islands may or may not be enforceable. For example, a United States judgment awarding remedies unobtainable in any legal action in the courts of the Cayman Islands, such as treble damages, would likely not be enforceable under any circumstances.. The relatively low trading volume of our stock may adversely impact the ability to sell our shares.. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the average daily trading volume of our common shares was approximately 53,000 shares, a much lower trading volume than that of many other companies listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers of our common shares at any given time. This presence in turn depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. As a consequence of the limited volume of trading in our common shares, an investor in our stock may have difficulty selling a large number of our common shares in the manner, or at the price, that might be attainable if our common shares were more actively traded.. The election process for our Board of Directors may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company.. We have a classified Board of Directors that consists of three groups. Only one group of directors is elected each year. The classified nature of our Board may increase the length of time necessary for an acquirer to change the composition of a majority of directors in order to gain control of our Board."
