[1] "Item                           1A.Risk                                          Factors. Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the risks related to our business set forth in this Form 10-K and the other information included in this Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the risks described below before purchasing our securities. Additional risks, uncertainties and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.. RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS. We will need to raise additional capital to operate our business and our failure to obtain funding when needed may force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our development programs or commercialization efforts.. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our operating activities used net cash of approximately $20.4 million and as of December 31, 2017 our cash and cash equivalents were $17.1 million. With the exception of the three months ended December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2010, we have experienced significant losses since inception and have a significant accumulated deficit. As of December 31, 2017, our accumulated deficit totaled approximately $194.2 million on a consolidated basis. We expect to incur additional operating losses in the future and therefore expect our cumulative losses to increase. With the exception of the quarter ended June 30, 2010, and limited laboratory revenues from Adeona Clinical Laboratory, which we sold in March 2012, we have generated very minimal revenues. We do not expect to derive revenue from any source in the near future until we or our potential partners successfully commercialize our products. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our anticipated activities, particularly as we continue research and development, initiate and conduct clinical trials, and seek marketing approval for our product candidates. Until such time as we receive approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities for our product candidates, we will not be permitted to sell our products and therefore will not have product revenues from the sale of products. For the foreseeable future we will have to fund all of our operations and capital expenditures from equity and debt offerings, cash on hand, licensing and collaboration fees and grants, if any.. We will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations and in order to meet our current timelines and we cannot be certain that funding will be available on acceptable terms on a timely basis, or at all. Based on our current plans, our cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to enable us to meet our near term expected plans. Any additional sources of financing will likely involve the issuance of our equity or debt securities, which will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may impact our ability to conduct our business. Although we continued preparation for our clinical trials, our planned Phase2b/3 clinical trials have been delayed until such time as we obtain adequate financing. A failure otherwise to raise additional funds when needed in the future could result is us being unable to complete planned preclinical and clinical trials or obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In addition, we could be forced to delay, discontinue or curtail product development, forego sales and marketing efforts, and forego licensing in attractive business opportunities. Our ability to raise capital through the sale of securities may be limited by the rules of the SEC and NYSE American that place limits on the number and dollar amount of securities that may be sold. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise the funds needed, especially in light of the fact that our ability to sell securities registered on our registration statement on Form S-3 will be limited until such time the market value of our voting securities held by non-affiliates is $75 million or more. We also may be required to seek collaborators for our product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available.. We expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures.. Other than with respect to the three months ended December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2010, we have a history of losses and we have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial losses and negative operating cash flow. Even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we may still incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and may not sustain profitability. We expect that our pivotal Phase 2b/3 and Phase 3 clinical trials will enroll a greater number of patients than our prior clinical trials and will be more costly than our prior clinical trials. In addition, we anticipate a need for additional employees as we undertake later stage clinical trials. We also expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses will substantially increase in the foreseeable future as we do the following:. ·continue                                          to undertake preclinical development and pivotal clinical trials for our product candidates,                                          including SYN-010 and SYN-004 (ribaxamase);. ·seek                                          regulatory approvals for our product candidates;. ·develop                                          our product candidates for commercialization;. ·implement                                          additional internal systems and infrastructure;. ·license                                          or acquire additional technologies;. 22. ·lease                                          additional or alternative office facilities;. ·manufacture                                          product for clinical trials; and. ·hire                                          additional personnel, including members of our management team.. We may experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our development and clinical programs with capital expenditures. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not be able to generate these revenues or achieve profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the value of our common stock and underlying securities.. We currently have no significant source of revenue and may never generate significant revenue. Currently, we have no products approved for commercial sale.. Our ability to generate revenue depends heavily on:. ·our                                          ability to raise additional capital on a timely basis to continue to fund our clinical                                          trials;. ·demonstration                                          in current and future clinical trials that our lead product candidates, SYN-010 for the                                          treatment of IBS-C and SYN-004 (ribaxamase) for the prevention of C. difficile,                                          are safe and effective;. ·our                                          ability to seek and obtain regulatory approvals, including with respect to the indications                                          we are seeking;. ·successful                                          manufacture and commercialization of our product candidates; and. ·market                                          acceptance of our products.. All of our existing product candidates are in various stages of development and will require extensive additional clinical evaluation, regulatory review and approval, significant marketing efforts and substantial investment before they could provide us with any revenue. As a result, even if we successfully develop, achieve regulatory approval and commercialize our products, we may be unable to generate revenue for many years, if at all. We do not anticipate that we will generate revenue from product sales for at least several years, if at all. If we are unable to generate revenue from product sales, we will not become profitable, and we may be unable to continue our operations.. Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing.. Our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017 have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report that includes an explanatory paragraph referring to our recurring losses from operations and expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern without additional capital becoming available. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies, reduce expenditures, and, ultimately, to generate revenue. Our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017 did not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.. Our research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may limit our ability to achieve profitability. We are largely dependent on the success of our lead product candidates, SYN-010 and SYN-004 (ribaxamase), which require significant additional clinical testing before we can seek regulatory approval and we cannot be certain that these product candidates will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.. We must continue to explore opportunities that may lead to new products and technologies. To accomplish this, we must commit substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Any such expenditures that we make will be made without any assurance that our efforts will be successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.. 23. The success of our business currently depends on our development, approval and commercialization of our lead product candidates, SYN-010 and SYN-004, which are our only two product candidates for which we have conducted clinical trials. Even though we are pursuing a registration pathway for each of these product candidates based on specific FDA input, there are many uncertainties known and unknown that may affect the outcome of future clinical trials. All of our product candidates, including SYN-004 and SYN-010, will require additional clinical and non-clinical development, regulatory review and approval in multiple jurisdictions, substantial investment, access to sufficient commercial manufacturing capacity and significant marketing efforts before we can generate any revenue from product sales. Regardless of whether our clinical trials are deemed to be successful, promising new product candidates may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or satisfy regulatory criteria, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Failure to obtain regulatory approvals of SYN-004 or SYN-010 in a timely manner would have a material adverse impact on our business. Even if we successfully develop SYN-010, SYN-004 or other new products or enhancements, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors innovations. Innovations may not be quickly accepted in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. We cannot state with certainty when or whether any of our products under development will be launched, whether we will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire drug candidates or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause our products to become obsolete, which may limit our ability to achieve profitability.. We are actively seeking and may form or seek strategic alliances or enter into additional licensing arrangements in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances or licensing arrangements.. We are actively seeking and may form or seek strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into additional licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to our product candidates and any future product candidates that we may develop. Any of these relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for our product candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may not view our product candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. If we license products or businesses, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction. Any delays in entering into new strategic partnership agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates in certain geographies for certain indications, which would harm our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.. We may not be able to retain rights licensed to us by others to commercialize key products and may not be able to establish or maintain the relationships we need to develop, manufacture, and market our products.. In addition to our own patent applications, we also currently rely on licensing agreements with third party patent holders/licensors for our products. We have an exclusive license agreement with CSMC relating to our IBS-C program. This agreement requires us or our sublicensee to use our best efforts to commercialize each of the technologies as well as meet certain diligence requirements and timelines in order to keep the license agreement in effect. In the event we or our sublicensee are not able to meet our diligence requirements, we may not be able to retain the rights granted under our agreement or renegotiate our arrangement institution on reasonable terms, or at all. If the license were to terminate and we were to lose the right to commercialize our products, our business opportunity would be adversely affected. Furthermore, we currently have very limited product development capabilities, and limited marketing or sales capabilities. For us to research, develop, and test our product candidates, we would need to contract with outside researchers, in most cases those parties that did the original research and from whom we have licensed the technologies. Our ECC agreements with Intrexon provide that Intrexon may terminate an agreement if we do not perform certain specified requirements, including developing therapies considered superior. Our agreement with UT Austin allows the UT Austin to terminate its agreement if we fail to comply with the terms of the agreement. Our agreement with CSMC allows CSMC to terminate its agreement if we fail to comply with the terms of the agreement.. We can give no assurances that any of our issued patents licensed to us or any of our other patent applications will provide us with significant proprietary protection or be of commercial benefit to us. Furthermore, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability, nor does the issuance of a patent provide the patent holder with freedom to operate without infringing the patent rights of others.. We will incur additional expenses in connection with our arrangements with Intrexon, our development of SYN-004 and SYN 010, and our agreement with CSMC.. Pursuant to our ECC agreements with Intrexon, we are responsible for future research and development expenses of product candidates developed under our collaboration, the effect of which has and will continue to increase the level of our overall research and development expenses going forward. Our agreements with CSMC requires that we initiate certain studies and file or have accepted an NDA within a certain amount of time, each of which are costly and will require additional expenditures. Although all manufacturing, preclinical studies and human clinical trials are expensive and difficult to design and implement, costs associated with the manufacturing, research and development of biologic product candidates are generally greater in comparison to small molecule product candidates. We have added additional personnel to support our ECC agreements with Intrexon, and research and development of our candidates, SYN-004 and SYN-010. In addition, we have commenced manufacturing of SYN-004 and SYN-010 material to support our planned preclinical and clinical studies which will require us to incur additional expenses.. 24. Because our biologic programs are relatively new, we have only recently assumed development responsibility and costs associated with such programs. In addition, because development activities in collaboration with Intrexon are determined pursuant to joint steering committees comprised of Intrexon and ourselves and we have limited product development experience, future development costs associated with these programs may be difficult to anticipate and exceed our expectations. Our actual cash requirements may vary materially from our current expectations for a number of other factors that may include, but are not limited to, unanticipated technical challenges, changes in the focus and direction of our development activities or adjustments necessitated by changes in the competitive landscape in which we operate. If we are unable to continue to financially support such collaborations due to our own working capital constraints, we may be forced to delay our activities. If we are unable to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all, we may be forced to seek licensing partners or discontinue development.. Developments by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive.. Companies that currently sell or are developing proprietary products for the prevention and treatment of C. difficile infection include: Actelion Pharmaceutical Ltd., Merck & Co. Inc., Merus B.V., Pfizer Inc., and Sanofi S.A. Companies that currently sell or are developing proprietary products for IBS-C include: Actavis plc, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. Companies that currently sell or are developing proprietary products for pertussis include: GlaxoSmithKline plc, MitsubishiTanabe Pharma Corporation and Sanofi S.A. Companies that sell or are developing products for the treatment of PKU include: BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Codexis, Inc. and Synlogic, Inc. Many of our competitors have significant financial and human resources. The infectious disease market is highly competitive with many generic and proprietary intravenous and oral formulations available to physicians and their patients. For our monoclonal antibodies, we currently do not expect to be able to deliver our infectious disease candidates via the oral route and may thus be limited to the in-patient and/or acute treatment setting. In addition, academic research centers may develop technologies that compete with our SYN-004, SYN-010, SYN-005 products and our other technologies. Should clinicians or regulatory authorities view alternative therapeutic regiments as more effective than our products, this might delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for our products, or it might prevent us from obtaining favorable reimbursement rates from payers, such as Medicare, Medicaid, hospitals and private insurers.. We operate in a highly competitive environment.. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including the monoclonal antibody industry, are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include major multi-national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies developing both generic and proprietary therapies to treat serious diseases. Many of our competitors have drugs that have already been commercialized and therefore benefit from being first to market their products. Many of these companies are well-established and possess technical, human, research and development, financial, and sales and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, many of our potential competitors have formed strategic collaborations, partnerships and other types of joint ventures with larger, well established industry competitors that afford these companies potential research and development and commercialization advantages in the therapeutic areas we are currently pursuing.. Academic research centers, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting and financing research activities which may produce products directly competitive to those being developed by us. In addition, many of these competitors may be able to obtain patent protection, obtain FDA and other regulatory approvals and begin commercial sales of their products before us. These competitors will compete with us in product sales as well as recruitment and retention of qualified scientific and management personnel, establishment of clinical trial sites and patient enrollment for clinical trials, as well as in the acquisition of technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business.. Competitors could develop and/or gain FDA approval of our product candidates for a different indication.. Many of our competitors may have more resources than us. We cannot provide any assurances that our products will be FDA approved prior to those of our competitors. We are subject to the risk that products containing our active ingredients that are already marketed to treat other indications, or future FDA approved products containing our active ingredients that are marketed to treat other indications, may be prescribed by physicians, or that physicians may substitute a competitors products, to treat the diseases for which we are intending to commercialize; this is commonly referred to as off-label use. While under FDA regulations a competitor is not allowed to promote off-label uses of its product, the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine and, as a result, cannot direct physicians to select certain products for their patients. Consequently, we might be limited in our ability to prevent off-label use of a competitors product to treat the diseases we are intending to commercialize, even if we have issued method of use patents for that indication. If we are not able to obtain and enforce our patents, if any, or otherwise receive orphan drug protection, a competitor could develop and commercialize similar products for the same indications that we are pursuing. We cannot provide any assurances that a competitor will not obtain FDA approval for a product that contains the same active ingredients as our products.. 25. If the parties we depend on for supplying substance raw materials for our product candidates and certain manufacturing-related services do not timely supply these products and services in sufficient quality or quantity, it may delay or impair our ability to develop, manufacture and market our product candidates.. We rely on suppliers for the substance raw materials of our product candidates and third parties for manufacturing-related services to produce material that meets appropriate content, quality and stability standards and use in clinical trials of our products and, after approval, for commercial distribution. To succeed, clinical trials require adequate supplies of study material, which may be difficult or uneconomical to procure or manufacture and there can be no assurance that we will successfully procure such study material or even if procured, that we can do so in quantities and in a timely manner to allow our clinical trials to proceed as planned. We and our suppliers and vendors may not be able to (i) produce our study material to appropriate standards for use in clinical studies, (ii) perform under any definitive manufacturing, supply or service agreements with us, or (iii) remain in business for a sufficient time to successfully produce and market our product candidates. If we do not maintain important manufacturing and service relationships, we may fail to find a replacement supplier or required vendor or manufacturer which could delay or impair our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our products and substantially increase our costs or deplete profit margins, if any. If we do find replacement manufacturers and vendors, we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable to us and, there could be a substantial delay before a new facility could be qualified and registered with the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities.. The third-party manufacturers of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and drug product for our lead product candidates, SYN-010 and SYN-004, are established cGMP manufacturers. For all other therapeutic areas we have not yet established cGMP manufacturers for our biologic and drug candidates. We currently have only one manufacturer for each of our lead product candidates. Although, we believe additional manufacturers are available, if either of our manufacturers were to limit or terminate production or otherwise fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy the supply commitments, the process of locating and qualifying alternate sources could require up to several months, during which time our production could be delayed. Any curtailment in the availability of SYN-004 or SYN-010 could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, because regulatory authorities must generally approve raw material sources for pharmaceutical products, changes in raw material suppliers may result in production delays or higher raw material costs.. The manufacture of our product candidates requires significant expertise and manufacturers may encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with federal, state and foreign regulations. We may experience longer than expected lead times with respect to the manufacture of SYN-004 (ribaxamase), which may result from the increase in manufacturing scale necessary to conduct our anticipated Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and result in trial delays. In addition, any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of our clinical trials, increase the costs associated with conducting our clinical trials and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at significant additional expense or to terminate a clinical trial.. We are responsible for ensuring that each of our contract manufacturers comply with the cGMP requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities from which we seek to obtain product approval. While we oversee compliance, we do not have control over our manufacturers and their compliance with regulatory requirements. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. The approval process for NDAs includes a review of the manufacturers compliance with cGMP requirements. We are responsible for regularly assessing a contract manufacturers compliance with cGMP requirements through record reviews and periodic audits and for ensuring that the contract manufacturer takes responsibility and corrective action for any identified deviations.. A failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval. Furthermore, if our manufacturers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, we may be unable to meet demand for any approved products and would lose potential revenues.. We may not be able to manufacture our product candidates in commercial quantities, which would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates.. To date, our product candidates have been manufactured in small quantities for preclinical studies and clinical trials. If any of our product candidates is approved by the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities in other countries for commercial sale, we will need to manufacture such product candidate in larger quantities. We may not be able to increase successfully the manufacturing capacity for any of our product candidates in a timely or economic manner, or at all. Significant scale-up of manufacturing may require additional validation studies, which the FDA must review and approve. If we are unable to increase successfully the manufacturing capacity for a product candidate, the clinical trials as well as the regulatory approval or commercial launch of that product candidate may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply. Our product candidates require precise, high quality manufacturing. Our failure to achieve and maintain these high quality manufacturing standards in collaboration with our third-party manufacturers, including the incidence of manufacturing errors, could result in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.. 26. If we do not obtain the necessary regulatory approvals in the U.S. and/or other countries we will not be able to sell our product candidates.. We cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize any of our product candidates or any product candidates we acquire or develop in the future. We will need FDA approval to commercialize our product candidates in the U.S. and approvals from the FDA-equivalent regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions to commercialize our product candidates in those jurisdictions. We will be required to conduct clinical trials that will be costly. We cannot predict whether our clinical trials will demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates or if the results of any clinical trials will be sufficient to advance to the next phase of development or for approval from the FDA. We also cannot predict whether our research and clinical approaches will result in drugs or therapeutics that the FDA considers safe and effective for the proposed indications. The FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process. The approval process may be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may prevent or delay commercialization of, and our ability to derive product revenues from our product candidates; and diminish any competitive advantages that we may otherwise believe that we hold.. Even if we comply with all FDA requests, the FDA may ultimately reject one or more of our NDAs or BLAs. We may never obtain regulatory clearance for any of our product candidates. Failure to obtain FDA approval of any of our product candidates will severely undermine our business by leaving us without a saleable product, and therefore without any source of revenues, until another product candidate can be developed. There is no guarantee that we will ever be able to develop or acquire another product candidate.. In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct additional pre-clinical and clinical testing or to perform post-marketing studies, as a condition to granting marketing approval of a product. The results generated after approval could result in loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of a product. The FDA has significant post-market authority, including the explicit authority to require post-market studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information, and compliance with FDA-approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. The FDAs exercise of its authority has in some cases resulted, and in the future could result, in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical trials and regulatory review, increased costs to comply with additional post-approval regulatory requirements and potential restrictions on sales of approved products.. In foreign jurisdictions, we must also receive approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities before we can commercialize any products, which can be time consuming and costly. Foreign regulatory approval processes generally include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval procedures described above. There can be no assurance that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize our product candidate for sale outside the United States.. If the FDA approves any of our product candidates, the labeling, manufacturing, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record-keeping for our products will be subject to ongoing FDA requirements and continued regulatory oversight and review. Our drug manufacturers and subcontractors that we retain will be required to comply with FDA and other regulations. We may also be subject to additional FDA post-marketing obligations. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our product candidates and/or may be subject to product recalls, seizures, suspension of regulatory approval, suspension of production, injunctions or civil or criminal sanctions. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with any marketed product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, may result in restrictions on the marketing of the product, and could include withdrawal of the product from the market.. Clinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to design and implement.. Human clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. The clinical trial process is also time-consuming. We estimate that clinical trials for our product candidates would take at least several years to complete. Furthermore, failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. Commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by several factors, including:. ·obtaining                                          an IND application with the FDA to commence clinical trials;. ·identification                                          of, and acceptable arrangements with, one or more clinical sites;. ·obtaining                                          IRB approval to commence clinical trials;. 27. ·unforeseen                                          safety issues;. ·determination                                          of dosing;. ·lack                                          of effectiveness during clinical trials;. ·slower                                          than expected rates of patient recruitment;. ·inability                                          to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment;. ·inability                                          to obtain supply of our drug candidate in a timely manner;. ·inability                                          or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols; and. ·unwillingness                                          of the FDA or IRBs to permit the clinical trials to be initiated.. In addition, we, IRBs or the FDA may suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if IRBs or the FDA finds deficiencies in our submissions or conduct of our trials.. The results of our clinical trials may not support our product candidate claims and the results of preclinical studies and completed clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results.. To date, long-term safety and efficacy have not yet been demonstrated in clinical trials for any of our product candidates. Favorable results in our early studies or trials may not be repeated in later studies or trials. Even if our clinical trials are initiated and completed as planned, we cannot be certain that the results will support our product candidate claims. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. Success of our predecessor P1A clinical product or positive topline data from our previous SYN-004 Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, does not ensure success of SYN-004, and positive topline data for our SYN-010 Phase 2 clinical trials does not ensure success of SYN-010. Furthermore, the FDA could determine that SYN-004 has not demonstrated safety and require additional clinical trials and safety data, despite positive results from our SYN-004 Phase 2b clinical trial and the determination by clinical sites investigators and an independent third party that the adverse events that occurred in the group that received SYN-004 in our Phase 2b clinical trial were not drug related. We cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials would replicate the results of prior clinical trials and preclinical testing nor that they would satisfy the requirements of the FDA or other regulatory agencies. Clinical trials may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or unacceptable safety issues, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Most product candidates that commence clinical trials are never approved as products. Any such failure could cause us or our sublicensee to abandon a product candidate and might delay development of other product candidates. Preclinical and clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals or commercialization. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials would delay our obtaining FDA approval for the affected product candidate and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize that product candidate.. If we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.. Delays in patient enrollment may result in increased cost or may adversely affect timing or outcome of planned clinical trials, which could prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our product candidates.. Delays in clinical testing could result in increased costs to us and delay our ability to generate revenue.. We may experience delays in clinical testing of our product candidates. We do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, will need to be redesigned or will be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial, in securing clinical trial agreements with prospective sites with acceptable terms, in obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site, in recruiting patients to participate in a clinical trial or in obtaining sufficient supplies of clinical trial materials. Manufacturing considerations for SYN-004 (ribaxamase), which may include an expected several month lead time following a decision to commence any clinical trial(s) and capacity considerations of our third-party contract manufacturers to provide clinical supply of SYN-004 could cause delays in clinical trials. Many factors affect patient enrollment, including the size of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and new drugs approved for the conditions we are investigating. Clinical investigators will need to decide whether to offer their patients enrollment in clinical trials of our product candidates versus treating these patients with commercially available drugs that have established safety and efficacy profiles. Any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product development and timeliness and approval process and delay our ability to generate revenue.. 28. Patients who are administered our product candidates may experience unexpected side effects or other safety risks that could cause a halt in their clinical development, preclude approval of our product candidates or limit their commercial potential.. Our clinical trials may be suspended at any time for a number of reasons. We may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. In addition, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials at any time if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to the clinical trial patients. For example, the FDA could determine that SYN-004 has not demonstrated safety and require additional clinical trials and safety data, despite positive results from our SYN-004 Phase 2b clinical trial and the determination by clinical sites investigators and an independent third party that the adverse events that occurred in the group that received SYN-004 in our Phase 2b clinical trial were not drug related.. Administering any product candidate to humans may produce undesirable side effects. These side effects could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of our product candidates and could result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying further development or approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Ultimately, some or all of our product candidates may prove to be unsafe for human use. Moreover, we could be subject to significant liability if any volunteer or patient suffers, or appears to suffer, adverse health effects as a result of participating in our clinical trials. Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our product candidates and could substantially increase commercialization costs.. A Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process for any of our product candidates.. In May 2017, we received breakthrough therapy designation for SYN-004 for the prevention of CDI. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established the breakthrough therapy designation for drugs intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and that, as indicated by preliminary clinical evidence, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA are eligible for accelerated approval and increased interaction and communication with the FDA designed to expedite the development and review process.. Designation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Even if we receive a breakthrough therapy designation for any of our product candidates, the designation may not result in a materially faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. Further, obtaining a breakthrough therapy designation does not assure or increase the likelihood of the FDAs approval of the applicable product candidate. In addition, the FDA could at any time determine that SYN-004 or any future product for which it grants breakthrough designation no longer meet the conditions for the designation or determine that the drug is ineligible for the associated benefits such as accelerated review or approval.. An NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2) subjects us to the risk that we may be subject to a patent infringement lawsuit that would delay or prevent the review or approval of our product candidate.. We plan to submit SYN-010 to the FDA for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies that were not conducted by, or for, the applicant and on which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The 505(b)(2) application would enable us to reference published literature and/or the FDAs previous findings of safety and effectiveness for the branded reference drug. For NDAs submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, the patent certification and related provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act apply. In accordance with the Hatch- Waxman Act, such NDAs may be required to include certifications, known as paragraph IV certifications, that certify that any patents listed in the Patent and Exclusivity Information Addendum of the FDAs publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book, with respect to any product referenced in the 505(b)(2) application, are invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the product that is the subject of the 505(b)(2) NDA.. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the holder of patents that the 505(b)(2) application references may file a patent infringement lawsuit after receiving notice of the paragraph IV certification. Filing of a patent infringement lawsuit against the filer of the 505(b)(2) applicant within 45 days of the patent owners receipt of notice triggers a one-time, automatic, 30-month stay of the FDAs ability to approve the 505(b)(2) NDA, unless patent litigation is resolved in the favor of the paragraph IV filer or the patent expires before that time. Accordingly, we may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of one or more product candidates only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before such product candidates may be commercialized, if at all. In addition, a 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. The FDA may also require us to perform one or more additional clinical studies or measurements to support the change from the branded reference drug, which could be time consuming and could substantially delay our achievement of regulatory approvals for such product candidates. The FDA may also reject our future 505(b)(2) submissions and require us to file such submissions under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA, which would require us to provide extensive data to establish safety and effectiveness of the drug for the proposed use and could cause delay and be considerably more expensive and time consuming. These factors, among others, may limit our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates.. Our product candidates, if approved for sale, may not gain acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community, thereby limiting our potential to generate revenues.. If one of our product candidates is approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the degree of market acceptance of any approved product by physicians, healthcare professionals and third-party payors and our profitability and growth will depend on a number of factors, including:. ·demonstration                                          of safety and efficacy;. ·changes                                          in the practice guidelines and the standard of care for the targeted indication;. ·relative                                          convenience and ease of administration;. ·the                                          prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects;. ·budget                                          impact of adoption of our product on relevant drug formularies;. ·the                                          availability, cost and potential advantages of alternative treatments, including less                                          expensive generic drugs;. ·pricing,                                          reimbursement and cost effectiveness, which may be subject to regulatory control;. ·effectiveness                                          of our or any of our partners sales and marketing strategies;. ·the                                          product labeling or product insert required by the FDA or regulatory authority in other                                          countries; and. ·the                                          availability of adequate third-party insurance coverage or reimbursement.. 29. If any product candidate that we develop does not provide a treatment regimen that is as beneficial as, or is perceived as being as beneficial as, the current standard of care or otherwise does not provide patient benefit, that product candidate, if approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, likely will not achieve market acceptance. Our ability to effectively promote and sell any approved products will also depend on pricing and cost-effectiveness, including our ability to produce a product at a competitive price and our ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement. If any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients and third-party payors, our ability to generate revenues from that product would be substantially reduced. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources, may be constrained by FDA rules and policies on product promotion, and may never be successful.. We depend on third parties, including researchers and sublicensees, who are not under our control. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to seek or obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.. Since we have in-licensed some of our product candidates, have sublicensed a product candidate and have collaboration agreements for the development of other product candidates, we depend upon our sublicensee and independent investigators and scientific collaborators, such as universities and medical institutions or private physician scientists, to advise us and to conduct our preclinical and clinical trials under agreements with us. These collaborators are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs or the timing of their procurement of clinical-trial data or their compliance with applicable regulatory guidelines. Should any of these scientific inventors/advisors or those of our sublicensee become disabled or die unexpectedly, or should they fail to comply with applicable regulatory guidelines, we or our sublicensee may be forced to scale back or terminate development of that program. They may not assign as great a priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking those programs ourselves. Failing to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug-development programs, or substandard performance and failure to comply with regulatory guidelines, could result in delay of any FDA applications and our commercialization of the drug candidate involved.. These collaborators may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. Our collaborators assisting our competitors could harm our competitive position. For example, we are highly dependent on scientific collaborators for our IBS-C development program, each of whom are employed by third parties.. With respect to our product candidates in collaboration with Intrexon, we are dependent upon Intrexons synthetic biology facilities and capabilities as we have no such facilities and capabilities of our own. We are also reliant on their vectors, monoclonal antibody discovery, production cell line development and know-how.. With respect to our product candidate for pertussis in collaboration with University of Texas at Austin, we are dependent on its research laboratories as we have no such facilities or capabilities of our own. If any of the foregoing were to become inaccessible or terminated, it would be difficult for us to develop and commercialize our synthetic biologic product candidates.. We have agreements with third-party contract research organizations (CROs), under which we have delegated to the CROs the responsibility to coordinate and monitor the conduct of our SYN-004 and SYN-010 clinical trials and to manage data for our clinical programs. We, our CROs and our clinical sites are required to comply with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, regulations and guidelines issued by the FDA and by similar governmental authorities in other countries where we are conducting clinical trials. We have an ongoing obligation to monitor the activities conducted by our CROs and at our clinical sites to confirm compliance with these requirements. In the future, if we, our CROs or our clinical sites fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations, and will require a large number of test subjects. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.. 30. We currently have no marketing, sales or distribution organization and have no experience in marketing products as a company. If we are unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may not be able to generate product revenue.. We currently have no marketing, sales or distribution capabilities and have no experience in marketing products. We may develop an in-house marketing organization and sales force, which will require significant capital expenditures, management resources and time. We will have to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain marketing and sales personnel.. If we are unable or decide not to establish internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we will pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our products; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements. Any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful. We may have little or no control over the marketing and sales efforts of such third parties and our revenue from product sales may be lower than if we had commercialized our product candidates ourselves. We also face competition in our search for third parties to assist us with the sales and marketing efforts of our product candidates.. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop in-house sales and distribution capabilities or establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators to commercialize any product in the United States or overseas.. Even if our products are approved, if doctors decide not to prescribe SYN-010 or hospitals decide not to prescribe SYN-004, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain our business.. To increase awareness and adoption of our products once approved, we and our collaborators will need to educate doctors and hospitals on the benefits and value of our products through published papers, presentations at scientific conferences and one-on-one education sessions. In addition, we and our collaborators will need to assure doctors of our ability to obtain and maintain adequate reimbursement coverage from third-party payors. We and our collaborators may need to hire additional commercial, scientific, technical, sales and marketing and other personnel to support this process. If our educational efforts fail and medical practitioners do not decide to prescribe our products in sufficient volume, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain our business. In addition, factors outside of our control, such as insurance reimbursement are expected to influence market acceptance of our products. Accordingly, even if we receive regulatory approval for the use of our products, we may not be successful in generating revenue from the sale of our products.. Reimbursement may not be available for our product candidates, which would impede sales.. Market acceptance and sales of our product candidates may depend on coverage and reimbursement policies and health care reform measures. Decisions about formulary coverage as well as levels at which government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, reimburse patients for the price they pay for our products as well as levels at which these payors pay directly for our products, where applicable, could affect whether we are able to commercialize these products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any of our products. Also, we cannot be sure that coverage or reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or are available only at limited levels, we may not be able to commercialize our products.. In recent years, officials have made numerous proposals to change the health care system in the United States. These proposals include measures that would limit or prohibit payments for certain medical treatments or subject the pricing of drugs to government control. In addition, in many foreign countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control. If our products are or become subject to government regulation that limits or prohibits payment for our products, or that subjects the price of our products to governmental control, we may not be able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.. As a result of legislative proposals and the trend towards managed health care in the United States, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. They may also impose strict prior authorization requirements and/or refuse to provide any coverage of uses of approved products for medical indications other than those for which the FDA has granted market approvals. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third-party payors will reimburse patients for their use of newly-approved drugs, which in turn will put pressure on the pricing of drugs.. Healthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent our product candidates commercial success.. The U.S. government and other governments have shown significant interest in pursuing continued healthcare reform. Any government-adopted reform measures could adversely impact the pricing of healthcare products and services in the United States or internationally and the amount of reimbursement available from governmental agencies or other third party payors. The continuing efforts of the U.S. and foreign governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care services to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our ability to set prices for our products which we believe are fair, and our ability to generate revenues and achieve and maintain profitability.. New laws, regulations and judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations and decisions, that relate to healthcare availability, methods of delivery or payment for products and services, or sales, marketing or pricing, may limit our potential revenue, and we may need to revise our research and development programs. The pricing and reimbursement environment may change in the future and become more challenging due to several reasons, including policies advanced by the current executive administration in the United States, new healthcare legislation or fiscal challenges faced by government health administration authorities. Specifically, in both the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.. 31. If product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates.. We face an inherent risk of product liability lawsuits related to the testing of our product candidates, and will face an even greater risk if we sell our product candidates commercially. Currently, we are not aware of any anticipated product liability claims with respect to our product candidates. In the future, an individual may bring a liability claim against us if one of our product candidates causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against the product liability claim, we may incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:. ·decreased                                          demand for our product candidates;. ·injury                                          to our reputation;. ·withdrawal                                          of clinical trial participants;. ·costs                                          of related litigation;. ·initiation                                          of investigations by regulators;. ·substantial                                          monetary awards to patients or other claimants;. ·distraction                                          of managements attention from our primary business;. ·product                                          recalls;. ·loss                                          of revenue; and. ·the                                          inability to commercialize our product candidates.. We have clinical trial liability insurance. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if marketing approval is obtained for our product candidates. Our current insurance coverage may prove insufficient to cover any liability claims brought against us. In addition, because of the increasing costs of insurance coverage, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy liabilities that may arise.. We rely on patent applications and various regulatory exclusivities to protect some of our product candidates and our ability to compete may be limited or eliminated if we are not able to protect our products.. The patent positions of pharmaceutical companies are uncertain and may involve complex legal and factual questions. We may incur significant expenses in protecting our intellectual property and defending or assessing claims with respect to intellectual property owned by others. Any patent or other infringement litigation by or against us could cause us to incur significant expenses and divert the attention of our management.. Others may file patent applications or obtain patents on similar technologies or compounds that compete with our products. We cannot predict how broad the claims in any such patents or applications will be, and whether they will be allowed. Once claims have been issued, we cannot predict how they will be construed or enforced. We may infringe intellectual property rights of others without being aware of it. If another party claims we are infringing their technology, we could have to defend an expensive and time consuming lawsuit, pay a large sum if we are found to be infringing, or be prohibited from selling or licensing our products unless we obtain a license or redesign our product, which may not be possible.. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. Some of our current or former employees, consultants, scientific advisors, current or prospective corporate collaborators, may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors or use our proprietary technology for their own benefit. Furthermore, enforcing a claim alleging the infringement of our trade secrets would be expensive and difficult to prove, making the outcome uncertain. Our competitors may also independently develop similar knowledge, methods, and know-how or gain access to our proprietary information through some other means.. 32. We may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights, as well as costs associated with lawsuits.. If any other person files patent applications, or is issued patents, claiming technology also claimed by us in pending applications, we may be required to participate in interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention. We, or our licensors, may also need to participate in interference proceedings involving our issued patents and pending applications of another entity.. The intellectual property environment in the monoclonal antibody field is particularly complex, constantly evolving and highly fragmented. We have not conducted freedom-to-use patent searches on all aspects of our product candidates or potential product candidates, and we may be unaware of relevant patents and patent applications of third parties. In addition, the freedom-to-use patent searches that have been conducted may not have identified all relevant issued patents or pending patents. We cannot provide assurance that our proposed products in this area will not ultimately be held to infringe one or more valid claims owned by third parties which may exist or come to exist in the future or that in such case we will be able to obtain a license from such parties on acceptable terms.. We cannot guarantee that the practice of our technologies will not conflict with the rights of others. In some foreign jurisdictions, we could become involved in opposition proceedings, either by opposing the validity of anothers foreign patent or by persons opposing the validity of our foreign patents.. We may also face frivolous litigation or lawsuits from various competitors or from litigious securities attorneys. The cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to these areas, even if deemed frivolous or resolved in our favor, could be substantial and could distract management from our business. Uncertainties resulting from initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our operations.. If we infringe the rights of others we could be prevented from selling products or forced to pay damages.. If our products, methods, processes, and other technologies are found to infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could be required to pay damages, or we may be required to cease using the technology or to license rights from the prevailing party. Any prevailing party may be unwilling to offer us a license on commercially acceptable terms.. We do not have a guarantee of patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity of the ingredients for our drugs even if we are granted FDA approval of our products.. The U.S. Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Hatch-Waxman) permits the FDA to approve Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) for generic versions of innovator drugs, as well as NDAs with less original clinical data, and provides patent restoration and exclusivity protections to innovator drug manufacturers. The ANDA process permits competitor companies to obtain marketing approval for drugs with the same active ingredient and for the same uses as innovator drugs, but does not require the conduct and submission of clinical studies demonstrating safety and efficacy. As a result, a competitor could copy any of our drugs and only need to submit data demonstrating that the copy is bioequivalent to gain marketing approval from the FDA. Hatch-Waxman requires a competitor that submits an ANDA, or otherwise relies on safety and efficacy data for one of our drugs, to notify us and/or our business partners of potential infringement of our patent rights. We and/or our business partners may sue the company for patent infringement, which would result in a 30-month stay of approval of the competitors application. The discovery, trial and appeals process in such suits can take several years. If the litigation is resolved in favor of the generic applicant or the challenged patent expires during the 30-month period, the stay is lifted and the FDA may approve the application. Hatch-Waxman also allows competitors to market copies of innovator products by submitting significantly less clinical data outside the ANDA context. Such applications, known as Section 505(b)(2) NDAs may rely on clinical investigations not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use and are subject to the ANDA notification procedures described above.. The law also permits restoration of a portion of a products patent term that is lost during clinical development and NDA review, and provides statutory protection, known as exclusivity, against FDA approval or acceptance of certain competitor applications. Restoration can return up to five years of patent term for a patent covering a new product or its use to compensate for time lost during product development and regulatory review. The restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and submission of an NDA, plus the time between NDA submission and its approval (subject to the five-year limit), and no extension can extend total patent life beyond 14 years after the drug approval date. Applications for patent term extension are subject to U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) approval, in conjunction with FDA. Approval of these applications takes at least nine months, and there can be no guarantee that it will be given at all.. Hatch-Waxman also provides for differing periods of statutory protection for new drugs approved under an NDA. Among the types of exclusivity are those for a new chemical entity and those for a new formulation or indication for a previously-approved drug. If granted, marketing exclusivity for the types of products that we are developing, which include only drugs with innovative changes to previously-approved products using the same active ingredient, would prohibit the FDA from approving an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA relying on our safety and efficacy data for three years. This three-year exclusivity, however, covers only the innovation associated with the original NDA. It does not prohibit the FDA from approving applications for drugs with the same active ingredient but without our new innovative change. These marketing exclusivity protections do not prohibit the FDA from approving a full NDA, even if it contains the innovative change.. 33. The technology on which our channel partnering arrangements with Intrexon are based on early stage technology.. On August 8, 2012, we announced an exclusive channel collaboration with Intrexon relating to the design, production, testing and commercialization of human recombinant monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of certain infectious diseases. Although monoclonal antibody therapeutics are well established in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors, their use for the treatment of infectious disease is extremely limited. In order for monoclonal antibodies to be effective for infectious diseases, they must not only properly target the organism of interest (or its toxins), but may also need to overcome defenses and forms of resistance of such organisms. To accomplish this may require the use of more than one specific monoclonal antibody, and mixtures of different monoclonal antibodies, which may create additional unforeseen complications, including increased manufacturing complexity and expense. In order to be competitive, monoclonal antibodies will be required to be produced at a low enough cost of goods in order to be profitably marketed. We have very limited development and manufacturing experience in the field of monoclonal antibodies and infectious disease. We cannot assure that any monoclonal antibody candidates will provide satisfactory in vitro and in vivo nonclinical results sufficient to warrant the expense of cGMP manufacture and clinical testing in human clinical trials.. On August 10, 2015, we expanded our relationship with Intrexon and entered into an ECC that governs a channel collaboration arrangement in which we intend to use Intrexons technology for development of biotherapeutic products for the treatment of PKU in humans. The strategy is to orally deliver a bacterium, Lactococcus lactis, that has been engineered to efficiently degrade phenylalanine in the GI tract to prevent phenylalanine absorption into the blood. The strategy is supported by data from rodent studies. The extent to which the data translate to large animal models and to a human therapeutic remains unknown. While genetically-modified versions of Lactococcus lactis have been tested in human clinical trials for other indications, the regulatory paths for recombinant bacterial products have not been fully established.. We do not expect to generate any additional revenue from our sublicense with Meda AB due to recent developments in Europe.. On May 6, 2010, we entered into a sublicense agreement with Meda AB whereby we were given the right to receive certain milestone payments totaling $17.5 million (including an upfront payment of $2.5 million that was received in 2010), plus certain royalties on our flupirtine program. Meda AB informed us that due to the decision of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to limit the use of flupirtine for long-term pill and systemic use, it has postponed its planned fibromyalgia clinical trials in the U.S. Therefore, we do not expect that the various milestones set forth in the sublicense agreement will be achieved by Meda AB, or that Meda AB will develop flupirtine for fibromyalgia in the U.S., Canada or Japan and accordingly we do not expect to receive any additional milestone payments or royalties on sales in connection with the sublicense agreement.. We may fail to retain or recruit necessary personnel, and we may be unable to secure the services of consultants.. As of February 20, 2018, we employed approximately 25 individuals, 24 of whom are full-time employees. We have also engaged clinical consultants to advise us on our clinical programs and regulatory consultants to advise us on our dealings with the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities. We have been and will be required to retain additional consultants and employees in order to fulfill our obligations under the ECC agreements with Intrexon, our development of SYN 010 and SYN-004 and our agreement with CSMC. Our future performance will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate newly hired officers into our management team and our ability to develop an effective working relationship among senior management.. Certain of our directors, scientific advisors, and consultants serve as officers, directors, scientific advisors, or consultants of other biopharmaceutical or biotechnology companies that might be developing competitive products to ours. Other than corporate opportunities, none of our directors are obligated under any agreement or understanding with us to make any additional products or technologies available to us. Similarly, we can give no assurances, and we do not expect and stockholders should not expect, that any biomedical or pharmaceutical product or technology identified by any of our directors or affiliates in the future would be made available to us other than corporate opportunities. We can give no assurances that any such other companies will not have interests that are in conflict with our interests.. Losing key personnel or failing to recruit necessary additional personnel would impede our ability to attain our development objectives. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the drug and biologic development areas, and we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel we would need to develop our business.. We rely on independent organizations, advisors, and consultants to perform certain services for us, including handling substantially all aspects of regulatory approval, clinical management, manufacturing, marketing, and sales. We expect that this will continue to be the case. Such services may not always be available to us on a timely basis when we need them.. We expect to increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.. We are a small company with 25 employees as of February 20, 2018. To continue our clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates, we will need to expand our employee base for managerial, operational, financial and other resources. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate additional employees. Over the next several months we plan to add additional employees to assist us with our commercial programs. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to:. ·manage                                          development efforts effectively;. ·manage                                          our commercialization activities effectively;. ·integrate                                          additional management, administrative, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel;. ·maintain                                          sufficient administrative, accounting and management information systems and controls;                                          and. ·hire                                          and train additional qualified personnel.. 34. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could harm our financial results and impact our ability to achieve development milestones.. Our management team may invest or spend the proceeds of our prior offerings and future offerings in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may not yield a significant return.. Our management will have broad discretion over the use of proceeds from our offerings. The net proceeds from our offerings, including sales made under the FBR Sales Agreement that we entered into on August 5, 2016 with FBR Capital Markets & Co. (the FBR Sales Agreement), will be used primarily for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, for clinical trials for our product candidates, paying general and administrative expenses and accounts payable, increasing our working capital, funding research and development and funding capital expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for licensing or acquiring intellectual property to incorporate into our products and product candidates or our research and development programs and to in-license, acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products, although we have no commitments or agreements with respect to any such licenses, acquisitions or investments as of the date of this filing supplement. Our management will have considerable discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will not have the opportunity, as part of their investment decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. The net proceeds may be used for corporate purposes that do not increase our operating results or enhance the value of our common stock. The failure of our management to use funds effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause the market price of our common stock to decline and impair the commercialization of our products and/or delay the development of our product candidates. Pending their use, we may invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government securities. These investments may not yield a favorable return to our stockholders.. RISKS RELATING TO OUR SECURITIES. We expect to seek to raise additional capital in the future, which may be dilutive to stockholders or impose operational restrictions.. We expect to seek to raise additional capital in the future to help fund development of our proposed products. If we raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or of debt securities, the percentage ownership of our current stockholders will be reduced. We may also enter into strategic transactions, issue equity as part of license issue fees to our licensors, compensate consultants or settle outstanding payables using equity that may be dilutive. Our stockholders may experience additional dilution in net book value per share and any additional equity securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock.. In order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share paid by existing stockholders, thereby subjecting such stockholders to dilution. We may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by existing stockholders, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by existing stockholders.. One of our principal stockholders and its affiliates may have has the ability to influence the vote on matters submitted to our stockholders and subsequent sales by such stockholder could adversely affect the market for our stock.. Through Intrexon and NRM VII Holdings I, LLC, Randal J. Kirk indirectly, beneficially owns approximately 13.2 million shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2017, or 10.3% of outstanding shares at such date. As a result, he may be able to exert influence over issues submitted to our stockholders, including the election of our Board of Directors and the vote on issues. The sale of a number of shares by our principal stockholder could have an adverse effect on the market for our stock and our share price.. Holders of our warrants issued in our October 2014 offering, and our November 2016 offering, and our Series A Preferred Stock have no rights as common stockholders until they exercise their warrants or convert their Series A Preferred Stock and acquire our common stock.. Until the holders of the warrants we issued in our October 2014 offering and our November 2016 offering and the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock acquire shares of our common stock by exercising their warrants or converting their Series A Preferred Stock, respectively, the holders have no rights as a stockholder with respect to the shares of common stock underlying their securities. Upon exercise of the warrants or conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the holders will be entitled to exercise the rights of a common stockholder only as to matters for which the record date occurs after the exercise date.. Because there is no established public trading market for the warrants or the Series A Preferred Stock we issued, the liquidity of each such security is limited. We do not expect a market to develop, nor do we intend to apply to list the warrants or the Series A Preferred Stock on any securities exchange. Upon exercise of the warrants and conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, our stockholders will experience dilution.. 35. The fundamental change purchase feature of the warrants we issued in our November 2016 offering may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company.. The terms of the November 2016 warrants require us to offer to purchase the warrants for cash in the event of a fundamental change, as defined. This feature may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.. The warrants are a risky investment. Holders of warrants may not be able to recover the investment in the warrants, and the warrants may expire worthless.. Whether the outstanding warrants will have any value will depend on the market conditions for, and the price of, our common stock, which conditions will depend on factors related and unrelated to the success of our clinical development program, and cannot be predicted at this time.. If our common stock price does not increase to an amount sufficiently above the exercise prices of the warrants during the periods the warrants are exercisable, holders of warrants will be unable to recover any of their investment in the warrants. In fact, the warrants issued in November 2016 that had an exercise price of $1.72 expired unexercised because their exercise price was above the common stock trading price. There can be no assurance that any of the factors that could impact the trading price of our common stock will result in the trading price increasing to an amount that will exceed the exercise price or the price required for holders of warrants to achieve a positive return on their investment in the warrants.. We may not have the funds necessary to fulfill our obligation to repurchase the warrants.. Under certain circumstances, if an extraordinary transaction (as defined in the warrant agreement) occurs, holders of the warrants issued in November 2016 may require us to repurchase the remaining unexercised portion of such warrants for an amount of cash equal to the value of the warrant as determined in accordance with the Black Scholes option pricing model and the terms of the warrants. Our ability to repurchase the warrants depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future. To some extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain sufficient cash reserves or that our business will generate cash flow from operations at levels sufficient to permit us to repurchase the warrants.. The issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock would reduce the relative voting power of holders of our common stock, would dilute the ownership of such holders and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.. The conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock to common stock would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. Sales by such holders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.. The holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock may exercise significant influence over us.. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will own approximately 15% of our shares of common stock on a fully diluted as-converted basis based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of the date hereof.. In addition, under the terms of the Certificate of Designation that governs the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series A Preferred Stock generally ranks, with respect to liquidation, dividends and redemption, senior to other securities and, so long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the approval of the holders of a majority of the Series A Preferred Stock outstanding at the time of approval is required in order for us to, among other things, (i) alter or change adversely the powers, preferences or rights given to the Series A Preferred Stock or alter or amend the Certificate of Designation; (ii) amend our Articles of Incorporation or bylaws in any manner that adversely affects any powers, preferences or rights of the Series A Preferred Stock; (iii) authorize or create any series or class of stock ranking as to redemption, distribution of assets upon a Liquidation Event (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) or dividends senior to, or otherwise pari passu with, the Series A Preferred Stock; (iv) declare or make any dividends other than dividend payments on the Series A Preferred Stock or other distributions payable solely in common stock; (v) authorize any increase in the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or issue any additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock; or (vi) enter into any agreement with respect to any of the foregoing.. 36. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock will have rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of our common stockholders.. Upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive out of our assets, in preference to the holders of the common stock and any junior preferred stock, an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the sum of the Accreted Value (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) plus an amount equal to all accrued or declared and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock that have not previously been added to the Accrued Value, or (ii) the amount that such shares would have been entitled to receive if they had converted into common stock immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In addition, upon consummation of a specified change of control transaction, each holder of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to have us redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at a price specified in the Certificate of Designation. These provisions may make it more costly for a potential acquirer to engage in a business combination transaction with us. Provisions that have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. If there are insufficient assets to pay in full such amounts, then the available assets will be ratably distributed to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with the respective amounts that would be payable on such shares if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. This will reduce the remaining amount of our assets, if any, available to distribute to holders of our common stock. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock also have a preferential right to receive cumulative dividends on the Accreted Value of each share of Series A Preferred Stock at an initial rate of 2% per annum, compounded quarterly.. In addition, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock also have certain redemption and conversion rights.. Our obligations to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. These preferential rights could also result in divergent interests between the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and holders of our common stock.. The redemption right of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial change of control transaction or result in a depletion of our cash in order to satisfy the redemption right of the holders Series A Preferred Stock.. The terms of the Series A Preferred Stock provide the holders with the right to require us to redeem the stock upon a change of control for cash in the event of a fundamental change, as defined. This feature may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that would otherwise be beneficial to investors or depleting our cash.. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and adversely affected by various factors.. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to various factors and events, including:. ·our                                          ability to execute our business plan;. ·operating                                          results below expectations;. ·announcements                                          concerning product development results, including clinical trial results, or intellectual                                          property rights of others;. ·litigation                                          or public concern about the safety of our potential products;. ·our                                          issuance of additional securities, including debt or equity or a combination thereof,                                          necessary to fund our operating expenses;. ·announcements                                          of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;. ·loss                                          of any strategic relationship;. ·industry                                          developments, including, without limitation, changes in healthcare policies or practices                                          or third-party reimbursement policies;. ·economic                                          and other external factors effecting U.S. or Global equity markets;. ·period-to-period                                          fluctuations in our financial results; and. ·whether                                          an active trading market in our common stock develops and is maintained.. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.. 37. We cannot assure you that the common stock will be liquid or that it will remain listed on the NYSE American.. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE American. Although we currently meet the NYSE Americans listing standards, which generally mandate that we meet certain requirements relating to stockholders equity, market capitalization, aggregate market value of publicly held shares and distribution requirements, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the continued listing standards of the NYSE American. The NYSE American requires companies to meet certain continued listing criteria including a minimum stockholders equity of $6.0 million if an issuer has sustained losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years, as outlined in the NYSE American Exchange Company Guide. At December 31, 2017, we had a stockholders deficit of $3.4 million. The NYSE American Exchange Company Guide also states that the NYSE normally will not consider removing from listing securities of an issuer with total value of market capitalization of at least $50.0 million and 1,100,000 shares publicly held, a market value of publicly held shares of at least $15.0 million and 400 round lot shareholders. Although the total value of our market capitalization currently exceeds $50.0 million and we have 1,100,000 shares publicly held, a market value of publicly held shares of at least $15.0 million and 400 round lot shareholders, there can be no assurance that the NYSE American will continue to list our common stock if we should fail to maintain the minimum stockholders equity, especially if our market capitalization falls below $50.0 million. A slight decrease in our share price without an increase in our number of outstanding shares of common stock would result in market capitalization below $50.0 million. In addition, in the future we may not be able to maintain such minimum stockholders equity and/or issue additional equity securities in exchange for cash or other assets, if available, to maintain certain minimum stockholders equity required by the NYSE American. If we are delisted from the NYSE American then our common stock will trade, if at all, only on the over-the-counter market, such as the OTC Bulletin Board securities market, and then only if one or more registered broker-dealer market makers comply with quotation requirements. In addition, delisting of our common stock could depress our stock price, substantially limit liquidity of our common stock and materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Delisting from the NYSE American could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers and employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws and Nevada law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, which may cause our stock price to decline.. Our articles of incorporation, as amended, our amended and restated bylaws and Nevada law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if closing such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders. The Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of an additional series of preferred stock that would grant holders preferred rights to our assets upon liquidation, special voting rights, the right to receive dividends before dividends would be declared to common stockholders, and the right to the redemption of such shares, possibly together with a premium, prior to the redemption of the common stock. To the extent that we do issue additional preferred stock, the rights of holders of common stock could be impaired thereby, including without limitation, with respect to liquidation.. Provisions of our articles of incorporation, as amended and our amended and restated bylaws may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. In particular, our articles of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws, among other things:. ·provide                                          the board of directors with the ability to alter the bylaws without stockholder approval;                                          and. ·provide                                          that vacancies on the board of directors may be filled by a majority of directors in                                          office, although less than a quorum.. Our failure to fulfill all of our registration requirements may cause us to suffer liquidated damages, which may be very costly.. Pursuant to the terms of the registration rights agreement that we entered into with Intrexon and an affiliated entity, we were required to file a registration statement with respect to securities issued and are required to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement. The failure to do so could result in the payment of damages by us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the effectiveness of any registration statement, and therefore there can be no assurance that we will not incur damages with respect to such agreements.. Pursuant to the terms of the registration rights agreement that we entered into with holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, we are required to file a registration statement with respect to the securities issued to them upon their request within certain time periods and are required to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement. The failure to do so could result in the payment of damages by us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the required filing deadlines or maintain the effectiveness of any registration statement, and therefore there can be no assurance that we will not incur damages with respect to such agreements.. 38. We do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.. We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the operation and growth of our business and currently do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if the market price of our common stock price appreciates. Our Series A Preferred Stockholders rank senior to our common stockholders with respect to dividends.. Resales of our common stock in the public market by our stockholders may cause the market price of our common stock to fall.. We may issue common stock from time to time in connection with future offerings. Any issuance from time to time of new shares of our common stock, or our ability to issue shares of common stock in future offerings, could result in resales of our common stock by our current stockholders concerned about the potential dilution of their holdings. In turn, these resales could have the effect of depressing the market price for our common stock.. The shares of common stock offered under the FBR Sales Agreement may be sold in at the market offerings, and investors who buy shares at different times will likely pay different prices.. Investors who purchase shares that are sold under the FBR Sales Agreement at different times will likely pay different prices, and so may experience different outcomes in their investment results. We will have discretion, subject to market demand, to vary the timing, prices, and numbers of shares sold, and there is no minimum or maximum sales price. Investors may experience declines in the value of their shares as a result of share sales made at prices lower than the prices they paid."
