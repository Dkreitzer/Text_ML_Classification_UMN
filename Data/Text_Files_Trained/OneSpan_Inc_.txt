[1] "Item 1A - Risk Factors. RISK FACTORS. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, which we consider the most significant, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, there are a number of less significant and other general risk factors that could affect our future results. If any of the events described in the risk factors were to occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially and adversely affected. We have grouped our Risk Factors under captions that we believe describe various categories of potential risk. For the reader's convenience, we have not duplicated risk factors that could be considered to be included in more than one category.. Risks Related to Our Business. A significant portion of our sales are to a limited number of customers. The loss of substantial sales to any one of them could have an adverse effect on revenues and profits.. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers, many of which are financial institutions. The loss of substantial sales to any one of them could adversely affect our operations and results. In fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, our top 10 largest customers contributed 27%, 36%, and 50%, respectively, of total worldwide revenue. In 2015, Rabobank contributed 30% of total revenue principally due to an order for card readers incorporating our CRONTO technology.. The return of a worldwide recession and/or an increase in the concern over the European sovereign debt crisis may further impact our business.. Our business is subject to economic conditions that may fluctuate in the major markets in which we operate. Factors that could cause economic conditions to fluctuate include, without limitation, recession, inflation, deflation, interest rates, unemployment, consumer debt levels, general retail or commercial markets and consumer or business purchasing power or preferences.. While it appears that circumstances that led to the sovereign debt crisis have abated, many significant economic issues have not been addressed fully. As a result, we expect that parts of Europe will continue to face difficult economic conditions in 2018. If global economic and financial market conditions remain uncertain and/or weak for an extended period of time, any of the following factors, among others, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tslower consumer or business spending may result in reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from customers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, increased inventories, and lower gross margins;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontinued volatility in the global markets and fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts or purchase orders in foreign currencies could negatively impact our reported financial results and condition;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontinued volatility in the prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins, and ultimately our profitability;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestructurings, reorganizations, consolidations and other corporate events could affect our customers' budgets and buying cycles, particularly in the banking industry;. 8. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tif our customers experience declining revenues, or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this could result in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, inability of customers to timely meet their payment obligations to us, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tin the event of a contraction of our sales, dated inventory may result in a need for increased obsolescence reserves;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta severe financial difficulty experienced by our customers may cause them to become insolvent or cease business operations, which could reduce the availability of our products to consumers; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany difficulty or inability on the part of manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain in obtaining sufficient financing to purchase raw materials or to finance general working capital needs may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products.. While we believe that many of the effects of the recession and credit crisis have abated, we are unable to predict potential future economic conditions, disruptions in the sovereign debt markets or other financial markets, the Euro Monetary Union or the European Union, or the effect of any such disruption or disruptions on our business and results of operations, but the consequences may be materially adverse. We believe that our business in the Banking market in Europe would be impacted most directly by any such disruption and that the consequences may be materially adverse, as approximately 48% of our consolidated revenues originated in the EMEA region in 2017.. Disruptions in markets or the European Union may affect our liquidity and capital resources.. We believe our financial resources are adequate to meet our operating needs. However, disruptions in the sovereign debt markets or other financial markets, the Euro Monetary Union or the European Union, could materially adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources and expose us to additional currency fluctuation risk. Sufficiently adverse effects could cause us to modify our business plans.. Furthermore, in an adverse economic environment there is a risk that customers may delay their orders until the economic conditions improve further. If a significant number of orders are delayed for an indefinite period of time, our revenue and cash receipts may not be sufficient to meet the operating needs of the business. If this is the case, we may need to significantly reduce our workforce, sell certain of our assets, enter into strategic relationships or business combinations, discontinue some or all of our operations, or take other similar restructuring actions. While we expect that these actions would result in a reduction of recurring costs, they also may result in a reduction of recurring revenue and cash receipts. It is also likely that we would incur substantial non-recurring costs to implement one or more of these restructuring actions.. We could incur substantial accounting related costs if we are unable to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting.. As a result of the material weakness disclosed as of December 31, 2016, related to deficiencies associated with our acquisition of Silanis Technology Inc. in November 2015 and its subsequent operations, we improved our internal control over financial reporting and the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures.  We expended significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight as we corrected past deficiencies. Management has determined that full remediation of the prior deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that led to the material weakness has occurred, and the subsequent investment in the control environment will continue.. We cannot provide absolute assurance that additional material weaknesses, or significant deficiencies, in our internal controls will not be identified in the future. Failure to maintain effective controls or implement new or improved controls could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, affect management evaluations and auditor attestations regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls, failure to meet periodic reporting obligations, and. 9. Table of Contents. material misstatements in our financial statements. Material misstatement of our financial statements may result in a restatement, loss of investor and customer confidence, a decline in the market price of the Company's common stock, and potential sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict the Company's future access to the capital markets.. We have a long operating history, but only modest accumulated profit.. Although we have reported net income (loss) of $(22.4) million, $10.5 million, and $42.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, our retained earnings were $156.2 million at December 31, 2017. Over our 25 year operating history, we have operated at a loss for many of those years. In the current uncertain economic environment, it may be difficult for us to sustain our recent levels of profitability. We may also choose to invest for long term value which could decrease or eliminate short term profit.. We derive revenue from a limited number of products and do not have a broadly-diversified product base.. A majority of our revenue is derived from the sale of authentication products. We anticipate a substantial portion of future revenue, will be derived from authentication products and related services. If the sale of these products and services is impeded for any reason and we have not diversified our product offerings, our business and results of operations would be negatively impacted.. The sales cycle for our products and technology is long, and we may incur substantial expenses for sales that do not occur when anticipated.. The sales cycle for our products, which is the period of time between the identification of a potential customer and completion of the sale, is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little control. If revenue falls significantly below anticipated levels, our business would be seriously harmed.. A typical sales cycle in the Banking market is often six months or more. Larger Banking transactions may take up to 18 months or more. Purchasing decisions for our products and systems may be subject to delays due to many factors that are not within our control, such as:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tTime required for a prospective customer to recognize the need for our products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSignificant expense of many data security products and network systems;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCustomer budgeting process; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCustomer testing and approval process.. As our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels, a small fluctuation in the timing of sales can cause our operating results to vary significantly between periods.. We have a great dependence on a limited number of suppliers and the loss of their manufacturing capability could materially impact our operations.. In the event that the supply of components or finished products is interrupted or relations with any of our principal vendors is terminated, there could be increased costs and considerable delay in finding suitable replacement sources to manufacture our products. The majority of our products are manufactured by four independent vendors domiciled in Hong Kong and Macau. Our hardware DIGIPASS authentication devices are assembled at facilities located in mainland China. The importation of these products from China exposes us to the possibility of product supply disruption and increased costs in the event of changes in the policies of the Chinese government, political unrest or unstable economic conditions in China or developments in the United States or European Union that are adverse to trade, including enactment of protectionist legislation.. 10. Table of Contents. We order some hardware components, such as processors, in advance of expected use and often produce finished goods prior to the receipt of executed customer orders. If orders are not received, we could suffer losses related to inventory that cannot be sold at full value.. In an attempt to minimize the risk of not having an adequate supply of component parts to meet demand and to take advantage of volume purchasing benefits, especially in situations where we have been notified that key processors will no longer be manufactured, we sometimes purchase multiple years' supply of parts based on internal forecasts of demand. In addition, to meet customers' demands for accelerated delivery of product, we sometimes produce finished product for existing customers before we receive the executed order from the customer. Should our forecasts of future demand be inaccurate or if we produce product that is never ordered, we could incur substantial losses related to the realization of our inventory.. Our success depends on establishing and maintaining strategic relationships with other companies to develop, market, and distribute our technology and products and, in some cases, to incorporate our technology into their products.. Part of our business strategy is to enter into strategic alliances and other cooperative arrangements with other companies in our industry. We currently are involved in cooperative efforts with respect to the incorporation of our products into products of others, research and development efforts, marketing efforts and reseller arrangements. None of these relationships are exclusive, and some of our strategic partners also have cooperative relationships with certain of our competitors. If we are unable to enter cooperative arrangements in the future or if we lose any of our current strategic or cooperative relationships, our business could be harmed. We do not control the time and resources devoted to such activities by parties with whom we have relationships. In addition, we may not have the resources available to satisfy our commitments, which may adversely affect these relationships. These relationships may not continue, may not be commercially successful, or may require our expenditure of significant financial, personnel and administrative resources from time to time. Further, certain of our products and services compete with the products and services of our strategic partners.. We may not be able to maintain effective product distribution channels, which could result in decreased revenue.. We rely on both our direct sales force and an indirect channel distribution strategy for the sale and marketing of our products. We may be unable to attract distributors, resellers and integrators, as planned, that can market our products effectively and provide timely and cost-effective customer support and service. There is also a risk that some or all of our distributors, resellers or integrators may be acquired, may change their business models or may go out of business, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. Further, our distributors, integrators and resellers may carry competing lines of products. The loss of important sales personnel, distributors, integrators or resellers could adversely affect us.. We depend on our key personnel for the success of our business and the loss of one or more of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business or could be negatively perceived in the capital markets.. Our success and our ability to manage our business depend, in large part, upon the efforts and continued service of our senior management team. The loss of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. It could be difficult for us to find replacements for our key personnel, as competition for such personnel is often intense. Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets, which could reduce the market value of our securities.. If we fail to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business may be harmed.. Our future success depends upon our ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel. Competition for such personnel is often intense and there can be no assurance that we can attract other highly qualified personnel in the future. If we cannot retain or are unable to hire such key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly adversely affected.. 11. Table of Contents. Changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.. Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors including the distribution of income among the various countries in which we operate, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including the impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions, changes in share-based compensation expense, and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods; and a reduction in our U.S. tax rate could negatively impact our deferred tax assets which could also adversely impact our net income.. Our worldwide income tax provisions and other tax accruals may be insufficient if any taxing authorities assume taxing positions that are contrary to our positions.. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and other taxes such as sales and VAT taxes. There are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of intercompany agreements to purchase intellectual properties, allocate revenue and costs, and other factors, each of which could ultimately result in changes once the arrangements are reviewed by taxing authorities. Although we believe that our approach to determining the amount of such arrangements is reasonable, we cannot be certain that the final tax authority review of these matters will not differ materially from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and other tax accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provisions or benefits, or other tax accruals, in the period in which such determination is made, and consequently, on our results of operations for such period.. Changes in global tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.. We could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy (or in their interpretation or enforcement) in Europe or other jurisdictions where we operate. These changes could be exacerbated by economic, budget or other challenges facing these jurisdictions. For example, foreign jurisdictions could impose tax rate changes along with additional corporate tax provisions that would disallow or tax perceived \"base erosion\" or profit shifting amongst jurisdictions. In addition, aspects of U.S. tax reform may lead foreign jurisdictions to respond by enacting additional tax legislation that results in an adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.. The ongoing effects of U.S. tax reform and the refinement of provisional estimates could make our results difficult to predict.. In December 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation (\"U.S. tax reform\"). The legislation implements many new U.S. domestic and international tax provisions. Many aspects of the U.S. tax reform are unclear, and although additional clarifying guidance is expected to be issued in the future (by the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Treasury Department or via a technical correction law change), it may not be clarified for some time. In addition, many states have not yet updated their laws to take into account the new federal legislation. As a result, we have not yet been able to determine the full impact of the new laws on our results of operations and financial condition. Provisional estimates used in our financial statements to reflect U.S. tax reform are expected to change and such changes could be significant depending on future guidance under U.S. tax reform and state actions.  It is possible that U.S. tax reform, or the guidance under it, could change in the future and could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.. We may acquire or invest in companies, which may disrupt our business and divert management's attention and cause harm to our financial condition or results. We may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions.. We may evaluate and consider potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets in the future. We also may enter into. 12. Table of Contents. relationships with other businesses to expand our products and platform, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution, discount pricing or investments in other companies.. Our failure to successfully structure or manage any acquisitions could seriously harm our financial condition or operating results. The expected benefits of any acquisition may not be realized. In connection with our acquisition of eSignLive and any future purchases, we will face additional financial and operational risks, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDifficulty in assimilating the operations, technology and personnel of acquired companies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDisruption in our business because of the allocation of resources to consummate these transactions and the diversion of management's attention from our existing business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDifficulty in retaining key technical and managerial personnel from acquired companies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDilution of our stockholders, if we issue equity to fund these transactions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tReduced liquidity, increased debt and higher amortization expenses;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAssumption of operating losses, increased expenses and liabilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur relationships with existing employees, customers and business partners may be weakened or terminated as a result of these transactions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDiscovery of unanticipated issues and liabilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFailure to meet expected returns; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDifficulty in maintaining financial reporting and internal control processes needed to be compliant with requirements applicable to companies subject to SEC reporting.. Reported revenue may fluctuate widely due to the interpretation or application of accounting rules.. Our sales arrangements often include multiple elements, including hardware, services, software, maintenance and support. In addition, we have sold software related arrangements in multiple forms, including perpetual licenses, term based licenses and SaaS, each of which may be treated differently under accounting rules. The accounting rules for such arrangements are complex and subject to change from time to time. Small changes in circumstances could cause wide deviations in the timing of reported revenue.. Provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.. Our agreements with customers, solution partners and channel partners generally include provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement and, in some cases, for damages caused by us to property or persons or for other damages. In addition, we make certain representations and warranties and incur obligations under our contracts in the ordinary course of business, including for items related to data security and potential data breaches. Not all of our potential losses under our contracts are covered by insurance policies, which could increase the impact of any such loss should it occur. Large indemnity payments or damages resulting from our contractual obligations could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.. 13. Table of Contents. The evolution of our business requires more complex development and go-to-market strategies, which involve significant risk.. Our increasing focus on developing and marketing a platform of solutions for identity management, authentication, risk analysis, fraud detection, digital business processes and related areas requires different development and go-to-market strategies than our historic hardware authentication business. We are developing, buying and licensing technology weighted toward software solutions and investment in research, development, product management, sales training and senior management. This transformation strategy is currently in progress and brings with it significant risks related to our choice of solutions and our ability to execute the strategy successfully. This strategy requires a greater focus on marketing and selling product suites and software solutions rather than selling hardware products for authentication and transaction signing. Consequently, we are developing, and must continue to develop, new strategies for marketing and selling our offerings. In addition, marketing and selling new technologies to enterprises requires significant investment of time and resources in order to train our employees and educate our customers on the benefits of our new product offerings. These investments can be costly and the additional effort required to educate both customers and our own sales force can distract from efforts to sell existing products and services.. Risks Related to the Market. We face significant competition and if we lose or fail to gain market share our financial results will suffer.. The market for data security products and services is highly competitive. Our competitors include organizations that provide data security products based upon approaches similar to and different from those that we employ. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, technical and other competitive resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products.. A decrease of average selling prices for our products and services could adversely affect our business.. The average selling prices for our solution offerings may decline as a result of competitive pricing pressures or a change in our mix of products, software and services. In addition, competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. Furthermore, we anticipate that the average selling prices and gross profits for our products will decrease over product life cycles. To maintain or realize our revenue and gross margins, we must continue to develop, or purchase and introduce new products and services that incorporate new technologies or increased functionality. If we experience such pricing pressures or fail to deliver new products and services relevant to our markets, our revenue and gross margins could decline, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We may need additional capital in the future and our failure to obtain capital would interfere with our growth strategy.. Our ability to obtain financing will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance and investor or creditor interest. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of any financing unattractive. They may also result in our incurring additional indebtedness or accepting stockholder dilution. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may have to forego strategic acquisitions or investments, defer our product development activities, or delay the introduction of new products.. We experience variations in quarterly operating results and sales are subject to seasonality, both of which may result in a volatile stock price.. In the future, as in the past, our quarterly operating results may vary significantly, resulting in a volatile stock price. Factors affecting our operating results include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe level of competition;. 14. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe size, timing, cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tNew product announcements or introductions by competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tTechnological changes in the market for data security products including the adoption of new technologies and standards;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in pricing by competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur ability to develop, introduce and market new products and product enhancements on a timely basis, if at all;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tComponent costs and availability;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAchievement of significant market share in particular markets followed by declines as buying cycles tend to be multiple years apart;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe variability of revenue realized from individual customers as their buying patterns often vary significantly from period to period;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur success in expanding our sales and marketing programs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tMarket acceptance of new products and product enhancements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in foreign currency exchange rates; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tGeneral economic conditions in the countries in which we operate.. We also experience seasonality in all markets. These seasonal trends are most notable in the summer months, particularly in Europe, when many businesses defer purchase decisions.. Our stock price may be volatile for reasons other than variations in our quarterly operating results.. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tActual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDifferences between actual operating results and results estimated by analysts that follow our stock and provide estimates of our results to the market;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDifferences between guidance relative to financial results, if given, and actual results;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in market valuations of other technology companies, and cybersecurity companies in particular;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAnnouncements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAdditions or departures of key personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFuture sales of common stock;. 15. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe inclusion or exclusion of our stock in ETF's, indices and other benchmarks, and changes made to methodologies connected therewith;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tTrading volume fluctuations; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tReactions by investors to uncertainties in the world economy and financial markets.. A small group of persons control a substantial amount of our common stock and could delay or prevent a change of control.. Our Board of Directors, our officers and their immediate families and related entities beneficially own approximately 23%, with Mr. T. Kendall Hunt beneficially owning approximately 21%, of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As the Chairman of the Board of Directors and our largest stockholder, Mr. Hunt may exercise substantial control over our future direction and operations and such concentration of control may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control and may also have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.. Certain provisions of our charter and of Delaware law make a takeover of our company more difficult.. Our corporate charter and Delaware law contain provisions, such as a class of authorized but unissued preferred stock which may be issued by our board without stockholder approval that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company. Delaware law also limits business combinations with interested stockholders. These provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control or a change in our management. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. The existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.. Future issuances of blank check preferred stock may reduce voting power of common stock and may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control.. Our corporate charter authorizes the issuance of up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock with such designations, rights, powers and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors, including such dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights, powers and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors without further stockholder approval. The issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock. In addition, the authorized shares of preferred stock and common stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control.. Risks Related to Technology and Intellectual Property. Technological changes occur rapidly in our industry and our development of new products is critical to maintain our revenue.. The introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable. Our future revenue growth and operating profit will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our current products and develop innovative products to distinguish us from the competition and to meet customers' changing needs. Security-related product developments and technology innovations by others may adversely affect our competitive position and we may not successfully anticipate or adapt to changing technology, industry standards or customer requirements on a timely basis.. 16. Table of Contents. Our business could be negatively impacted by cyber security incidents and other disruptions.. Our use of technology is increasing and is critical in three primary areas of our business:. 1. \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSoftware and information systems that we use to help us run our business more efficiently and cost effectively;. 2. \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe products we have traditionally sold and continue to sell to our customers for integration into their software applications contain technology that incorporates the use of secret numbers and encryption technology; and. 3. \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSolutions delivered on a software-as-a-service basis, from both public and private cloud models, which may process and store confidential, personal, health and financial information.. A cyber incident in any of these areas of our business could disrupt our ability to take orders or deliver products or services to our customers, cause us to suffer significant monetary and other losses and significant reputational harm, or substantially impair our ability to grow the business. We expect that there will continue to be hacking attempts intended to impede the performance of our products, disrupt our services and harm our reputation as a company, as the processes used by computer hackers to access or sabotage technology products, services and networks are rapidly evolving in sophistication.. In July 2011, we experienced a cyber incident related to DigiNotar B.V. shortly after we purchased the company. The hacking incident at DigiNotar B.V.led to the termination of DigiNotar B.V's registration as a certification service provider and DigiNotar B.V.'s bankruptcy. We may incur losses from such events as a result of unanticipated costs associated with hacking incidents.. In addition, because we are in the cyber security industry, we could be targeted by hackers more than other companies and if a material cyber security breach occurred related to corporate or customer information, the reputational harm and potential lost future business could be greater than other companies not in our industry.  We have taken various measures to strengthen the security of our products and our systems, to establish information security governance procedures and to train our employees. However, we are the subject of a large volume of hacking attempts and our defenses might not always be effective. If a hacking attempt were to be successful and lead to a material data breach, then it could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, both in the current period and for a significant future period of time.. We rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate portions of our platform and any disruption of or interference with our use of Amazon Web Services would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We outsource portions of our cloud infrastructure to Amazon Web Services, or AWS. Customers of our products need to be able to access our platform at any time, without interruption or degradation of performance. AWS runs its own platform that we access, and we are, therefore, vulnerable to service interruptions at AWS. We have experienced, and expect that in the future we may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints. Capacity constraints could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud or security attacks. In addition, if our security, or that of AWS, is compromised, our products or platform are unavailable or our users are unable to use our products within a reasonable amount of time or at all, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within a period of time acceptable to our customers. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our platform performance, especially during peak usage times, as our products become more complex and the usage of our products increases. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, either through AWS or alternative providers of cloud infrastructure, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.. 17. Table of Contents. In addition, any changes in service levels from AWS may adversely affect our ability to meet our customers' requirements.. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation, possibly move customers to stop using our products, impair our ability to increase revenue from existing customers, impair our ability to grow our customer base, subject us to financial penalties and liabilities under our service level agreements and otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. These risks are present with our other cloud service infrastructure vendors beside AWS as well.. Our products contain third-party, open-source software and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open-source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products or otherwise result in claims of infringement.. Our products are distributed with software programs licensed to us by third-party authors under \"open-source\" licenses, which may include the GNU General Public License, the GNU Lesser Public License, the BSD License and the Apache License. These open-source software programs include, without limitation, Linux, Apache, Openssl, IPTables, Tcpdump, Postfix, Cyrus, Perl, Squid, Snort, Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Puppet. These third-party, open-source programs are typically licensed to us for no fee and the underlying license agreements generally require us to make available to users the source code for such programs, as well as the source code for any modifications or derivative works we create based on these third-party, open-source software programs.. We do not believe that we have created any modifications or derivative works to, an extended version of, or works based on, any open-source software programs referenced above. We include instructions to users on how to obtain copies of the relevant open-source code and licenses.. We do not provide end users a copy of the source code to our proprietary software because we believe that the manner in which our proprietary software is aligned or communicates with the relevant open-source programs does not create a modification, derivative work or extended version of, or a work based on, that open-source program requiring the distribution of our proprietary source code.. Our ability to commercialize our products by incorporating third-party, open-source software may be restricted because, among other reasons:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe terms of open-source license agreements are unclear and subject to varying interpretations, which could result in unforeseen obligations regarding our proprietary products or claims of infringement;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tit may be difficult to determine the developers of open-source software and whether such licensed software infringes another party's intellectual property rights;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompetitors will have greater access to information by obtaining these open source products, which may help them develop competitive products; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\topen-source software potentially increases customer support costs because licensees can modify the software and potentially introduce errors.. We must continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical personnel for our research and development efforts.. The market for highly skilled technicians is highly competitive. If we fail to attract, train, assimilate and retain qualified technical personnel for our research and development and product management efforts, we will experience delays or failures in introductions of new or modified products, and services, failures in adequate analysis of technology or acquisitions in the market, loss of clients and market share and a reduction in revenue.. 18. Table of Contents. We cannot be certain that our research and development activities will be successful.. While management is committed to enhancing our current product offerings and introducing new products, we cannot be certain our research and development activities will be successful. Furthermore, we may not have sufficient financial resources to identify and develop new technologies and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner, and we cannot ensure that any such products will be commercially successful.. Failure to effectively manage our product and service lifecycles could harm our business.. As part of the natural lifecycle of our products and services, we periodically inform customers that products or services will be reaching their end of life or end of availability and will no longer be supported or receive updates and security patches.  Failure to effectively manage our product and service lifecycles could lead to customer dissatisfaction and contractual liabilities, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.. SaaS offerings, which involve various risks, constitute an important part of our business.. As we continue to acquire, develop and offer SaaS versions of products, we will need to continue to evolve our processes to meet a number of regulatory, intellectual property, contractual and service compliance challenges. These challenges include compliance with licenses for open source and third party software embedded in our SaaS offerings, maintaining compliance with export control and privacy regulations, including HIPAA and GDPR, protecting our services from external threats, maintaining continuous service levels and data security expected by our customers, preventing inappropriate use of our services and adapting our go-to-market efforts. In addition to using our internal resources, we also utilize third party resources to deliver SaaS offerings, such as third party data hosting vendors. The failure of a third party provider to prevent service disruptions, data losses or security breaches may require us to issue credits or refunds or indemnify or otherwise be liable to customers or third parties for damages that may occur. Additionally, if these third-party providers fail to deliver on their obligations, our reputation could be damaged, our customers could lose confidence in us and our ability to maintain and expand our SaaS offerings. Finally, our SaaS offerings need to be designed to operate at significant transaction volumes. When combined with third party software and hosting infrastructure, our SaaS offerings may not perform as designed which could lead to service disruptions and associated damages.. We depend significantly upon our proprietary technology and intellectual property and the loss of or successful challenge to our proprietary rights could require us to divert management attention and could reduce revenue and increase our operating costs.. From time to time, we receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, including claims regarding patents, copyrights, and trademarks. Because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that the number of these claims may grow. In addition, former employers of our former, current, or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers. Any such claim, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and distract management from day-to-day operations. If we are not successful in defending such claims, we could be required to stop selling, delay shipments, redesign our products, pay monetary amounts as damages, enter into royalty or licensing arrangements, or satisfy indemnification obligations with our customers. Royalty or licensing arrangements we may seek in such circumstances may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to establish our intellectual property rights and to investigate, defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk. In addition, we license and use software from third parties in our business. These third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and may expose us to additional liability. This liability, or our inability to use any of this third party software, could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results.. We rely principally on trade secrets to protect much of our intellectual property in cases where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although our. 19. Table of Contents. employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information. We may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary information, our competitive position could be adversely affected. In the course of conducting our business, we may inadvertently infringe the intellectual property rights of others, resulting in claims against us or our customers. Our contracts generally indemnify our customers for third-party claims for intellectual property infringement by the services and products we provide. The expense of defending these claims may adversely affect our financial results and may not be covered by any insurance policies we maintain.. Our patents may not provide us with competitive advantages.. We hold several patents in the United States and in other countries, which cover multiple aspects of our technology. A substantial part of our patents cover the DIGIPASS product line. Our patents expire between 2019 and 2035. There can be no assurance that we will continue to develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable, that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties, or that patents of others will not hinder our competitive advantage. Although certain of our technologies are patented, there are other organizations that offer products with comparable functionality that employ different technological solutions and compete with us for market share.. We are subject to warranty and product liability risks.. A malfunction of or design defect in our products which results in a breach of a customer's data security or physical harm or damage from our hardware products could result in tort or warranty claims against us. We seek to reduce the risk of these losses by using qualified engineers in the design, manufacturing and testing of our hardware products, attempting to negotiate warranty disclaimers and liability limitation clauses in our sales agreements, and maintaining customary insurance coverage. However, these measures may ultimately prove ineffective in limiting our liability for damages.. In addition to any monetary liability for the failure of our products, an actual or perceived breach of network or data security at one of our customers could adversely affect the market's perception of us and our products, and could have an adverse effect on our reputation and the demand for our products. Similarly, an actual or perceived breach of network or data security within our own systems could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on the demand for our products.. There is significant government regulation of technology exports and to the extent we cannot meet the requirements of the regulations we may be prohibited from exporting some of our products, which could negatively impact our revenue.. Our international sales and operations are subject to risks such as the imposition of government controls, new or changed export license requirements, restrictions on the export of critical technology, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis our business may be impacted. Certain of our products are subject to export controls under U.S. law. The list of products and countries for which export approval is required, and the regulatory policies with respect thereto, may be revised from time to time and our inability to obtain required approvals under these regulations could materially and adversely affect our ability to make international sales. Violations of export control and international trade laws could result in penalties, fines, adverse reputational consequences, and other materially adverse consequences. Reference is made to Part 1, Item 3, Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K with respect to the internal investigation regarding sales of VASCO products by a VASCO European subsidiary to a third party distributor which distributor may have resold such products to Iranian entities.. 20. Table of Contents. We employ cryptographic technology in our authentication products that uses complex mathematical formulations to establish network security systems.. Many of our products are based on cryptographic technology. With cryptographic technology, a user is given a key that is required to encrypt and decode messages. The security afforded by this technology depends on the integrity of a user's key and in part on the application of algorithms, which are advanced mathematical factoring equations. These codes may eventually be broken or become subject to government regulation regarding their use, which would render our technology and products less effective. The occurrence of any one of the following could result in a decline in demand for our technology and products:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAny significant advance in techniques for attacking cryptographic systems, including the development of an easy factoring method or faster, more powerful computers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPublicity of the successful decoding of cryptographic messages or the misappropriation of keys; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIncreased government regulation limiting the use, scope or strength of cryptography.. Risks Related to International Operations. We face a number of risks associated with our international operations, any or all of which could result in a disruption in our business and a decrease in our revenue.. In 2017, approximately 72% of our revenue and approximately 76% of our operating expenses were generated/incurred outside of the U.S. In 2016, approximately 88% of our revenue and approximately 73% of our operating expenses were generated/incurred outside of the U.S. In 2015, approximately 95% of our revenue and approximately 65% of our operating expenses were generated/incurred outside of the U.S. A severe economic decline in any of our major foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.. In addition to exposures to changes in the economic conditions of our major foreign markets, we are subject to a number of risks any or all of which could result in a disruption in our business and a decrease in our revenue. These include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tInconsistent regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tExport controls relating to our technology;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDifficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations, including maintaining internal controls;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPotentially adverse tax consequences;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWage and price controls or protection;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tUncertain protection for intellectual property rights, contractual rights and collecting accounts receivable;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tImposition of trade barriers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDiffering technology standards;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tUncertain demand for electronic commerce;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tLinguistic and cultural differences;. 21. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tA widely distributed workforce;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDifficulty in providing support and training to customers in certain international locations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPolitical instability; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSocial unrest.. We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks, and improper management of that risk could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial conditions.. Because a significant number of our principal customers are located outside the United States, we expect that international sales will continue to generate a significant portion of our total revenue. We are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations and risks because the majority of our product costs are denominated in U.S. Dollars, whereas a significant portion of the sales and expenses of our foreign operating subsidiaries are denominated in various foreign currencies. A decrease in the value of any of these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar could adversely affect our revenue and profitability in U.S. Dollars of our products sold in these markets. We do not currently hold forward exchange contracts to exchange foreign currencies for U.S. Dollars to offset currency rate fluctuations.. Changes in the European regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.. In Europe, we are subject to the 1995 European Union (\"EU\") Directive on Data Protection (\"1995 Data Protection Directive\"), which requires EU member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the United States. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines. The EU member state regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data, including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the EU to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security. In addition, certain member states have adopted more stringent data protection standards. The Company addressed these requirements by certification to the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Frameworks prior to such Frameworks being invalidated in October 2015 by the European Court of Justice. The General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") will replace the 1995 Data Protection Directive effective May 25, 2018, creating significant impacts on how businesses can collect and process the personal data of EU individuals. In the interim, we are pursuing alternative methods of compliance, but those methods may be subject to scrutiny by data protection authorities in EU member states. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.. We must comply with governmental regulations setting environmental standards.. Governmental regulations setting environmental standards influence the design, components or operation of our products. New regulations and changes to current regulations are always possible and, in some jurisdictions, regulations may be introduced with little or no time to bring related products into compliance with these regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may prevent us from selling our products in a certain country. In addition, these regulations may increase our cost of supplying the products by forcing us to redesign existing products or to use more expensive designs or components. In these cases, we may experience unexpected disruptions in our ability to supply customers with products, or we may incur unexpected costs or operational complexities to bring products into compliance. This could have an adverse effect on our revenues, gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of our financial results.. We are subject to the Restriction on the Use of Hazardous Substances Directive 2002/95/EC (also known as the \"RoHS Directive\") and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (also known as the \"WEEE Directive\").. 22. Table of Contents. These directives restrict the distribution of products containing certain substances, including lead, within applicable geographies and require a manufacturer or importer to recycle products containing those substances.. These directives affect the worldwide electronics and electronics components industries as a whole. If we or our customers fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could incur liabilities and fines and our operations could be suspended.. The vote by the United Kingdom (UK) to leave the European Union (EU) could adversely affect our financial results.. In June 2016, UK voters approved a referendum to withdraw the UK's membership from the EU, which is commonly referred to as \"Brexit\". In March 2017, the UK government initiated the exit process under Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union, commencing a period of up to two years for the UK and the other EU member states to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal. We have operations in the UK and the EU, and as a result, we face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and disruptions that may lead up to and follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates and potential material changes to the regulatory regime applicable to our operations in the UK. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Although we do not have a substantial portion of our operations in, nor derive a substantial portion of our revenue from, the UK, we do have substantial operations and revenue in the EU. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate or that may evolve over time, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.. We or our suppliers may be impacted by new regulations related to climate change.. In addition to the European environmental regulations noted above, we or our suppliers may become subject to new laws enacted with regards to climate change. In the event that new laws are enacted or current laws are modified in countries in which we or our suppliers operate, our flow of product may be impacted and/or the costs of handling the potential waste associated with our products may increase dramatically, either of which could result in a significant negative impact on our ability to operate or operate profitably.. The effects of regulations relating to conflict minerals may adversely affect our business.. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals and derivatives ( collectively \"Conflict Minerals\") which may originate from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries (collectively, \"Covered Countries\"). As a result, in August 2012 the SEC established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for companies using Conflict Minerals in their products, including products manufactured by third parties. Like many electronic devices, our hardware products contain Conflict Minerals and are subject to the disclosure and reporting requirements. Compliance with these rules also requires due diligence including country of origin inquiries to determine the sources of Conflict Minerals used in our products.. As required, we filed our annual reports related to products manufactured. We reported that we determined we had no reason to believe Conflict Minerals used in our products may have originated in Covered Countries.. We may incur continued costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements. These requirements may affect pricing, sourcing and availability of Conflict Minerals used to produce our devices. We may be unable to verify the origin of all Conflict Minerals in our products. We may encounter challenges with customers and stakeholders if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free.. U.S. investors may have difficulties in making claims for any breach of their rights as holders of shares because some of our assets and key employees are not located in the United States.. Several of our key employees are full-time or part-time residents of foreign countries, and a substantial portion of our assets and those of some of our key employees are located in foreign countries. As a result, it may not be possible. 23. Table of Contents. for investors to effect service of process on those persons located in foreign countries, or to enforce judgments against some of our key employees based upon the securities or other laws of jurisdictions in those foreign countries.. Our business in countries with a history of corruption and transactions with foreign governments increase the risks associated with our international activities.. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, deal with and make sales to governmental or quasi-governmental customers in countries known to experience corruption, particularly certain countries in the Middle East, Africa, East Asia and South America, and further expansion of our international selling efforts may involve additional regions. Our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents or channel partners that could be in violation of various laws, including the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, even though these parties are not always subject to our control. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, including suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Violations of the U.K. Bribery Act may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and we may be subject to other liabilities that could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition."
