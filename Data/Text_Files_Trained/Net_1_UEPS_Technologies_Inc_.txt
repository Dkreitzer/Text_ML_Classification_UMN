[1] "ITEM 1A.      RISK   FACTORS. OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, AND THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.. Risks Relating to Our Business. In fiscal 2018, we derived a significant portion of our revenues from our SASSA contract and the related bank accounts, which we will lose when we no longer provide a service to SASSA.. We derive a significant portion of our revenue from our contract with SASSA for the payment of social grants. Our SASSA contract, which we were awarded through a competitive tender process in 2012, was originally scheduled to expire in March 2017, and then extended to the end of March 2018. In March 2018, the Constitutional Court of South Africa, which retained oversight of SASSA as a result of litigation related to the original award of the contract to us in 2012, ruled that SASSA and CPS have a constitutional obligation to continue to pay social welfare grants and ordered that the contract be extended for an additional six months in respect of the payment of grant beneficiaries at cash pay points. Refer to \"Item 3 - Legal Proceedings\" for a summary of the Constitutional Court's order.. We do not expect our contract with SASSA to be extended beyond September 2018 and, therefore, we expect to lose revenues from the payment of social welfare grants at the time of the expiration of the SASSA contract. In addition, SASSA has publicly conveyed its expectation that most of the SASSA/Grindrod cards will be replaced by SAPO cards and, therefore, we expect that our revenue generated from the provision of SASSA/Grindrod bank accounts is also likely to be lost. Unless we are able to replace most or all of this revenue from other sources, our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and future growth are likely to suffer materially.. It is possible that SASSA might request us to enter into a transition agreement in order to phase out our services if their plan to do so is not completed within the required timeframe. The Constitutional Court reaffirmed in its March 2017 ruling that CPS is deemed to be an \"organ of state\" for the purposes of the contract between SASSA and CPS, and that CPS has \"constitutional obligations\" that go beyond its contractual obligations. We cannot predict what the financial or other implications may be if we are required to provide our services without a valid contract, or during any transitional period required for the orderly transfer of our services to SASSA and SAPO.. Our South African business practices remain under intense scrutiny in the South African media. We continue to publicly refute what we believe to be misleading or factually incorrect statements that have damaged our reputation. However, our ability to operate effectively and efficiently in South Africa in the future will be adversely impacted if we are unable to communicate persuasively that our business practices comply with South African law and are fair to the customers who purchase our financial services products.. The South African public, media, non-governmental organizations and political parties have utilized a number of platforms, including social media, to criticize SASSA over its failure to implement the orders of the Constitutional Court over the last two years and express their dissatisfaction with the state of affairs. Among the criticisms, we have been accused of being responsible for SASSA's inability to bring the payment service in-house. In addition, we were publicly accused of illegally providing our services and defrauding social welfare grant recipients. We have publicly denied these accusations and believe they have no merit.. These allegations continue to be made and are being emphasized during this transition period as a justification for requiring grant beneficiaries to move to the SAPO card. We continue to deny the accusations made against us.. Our reputation in South Africa has been tarnished as a result of these accusations. We have attempted to refute the allegations made against us and have appointed a public relations firm to assist us in communicating effectively to the public and our stakeholders that our business practices comply with South African law and are fair to the social welfare grant recipients who purchase the financial services products that we offer. It is difficult to quantify to what extent we have been successful in effectively repudiating these unsubstantiated allegations against us. If we are unable to communicate persuasively that our business practices comply with South African law and are fair to the customers who purchase our financial services products, our ability to operate effectively and efficiently in South Africa in the future will be adversely impacted, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows would be adversely affected.. 13. SASSA and other organizations continue to challenge our ability to conduct certain aspects of our financial services business in a commercial manner through their interpretations of recently adopted regulations under the Social Assistance Act. We are in litigation with SASSA and the Black Sash over its interpretation of these regulations. If SASSA or the Black Sash were to prevail in this legal proceeding, our business will suffer.. As described under \"Item 3 - Legal Proceedings -  Litigation Regarding Legality of Debit Orders under Social Assistance Act Regulations,\" the High Court of the Republic of South Africa Gauteng Division, Pretoria, or Pretoria High Court, has issued the declaratory order sought by us that the Social Assistance Act and Regulations do not restrict social grant recipients in the operation of their banks accounts. SASSA continues to challenge our ability to operate certain aspects of our financial services business in a commercial manner in the South African courts. The Black Sash has also served applications petitioning the South African Supreme Court of Appeal, or the Supreme Court, to grant them leave to appeal the Pretoria High Court order through either the Supreme Court or to a full bench of the Pretoria High Court. The petitions served on the Supreme Court applying for leave to appeal were heard on August 16 and 17, 2018. We cannot predict whether leave to appeal will be granted or if granted, how the Supreme Court will rule on this matter.. If SASSA or the Black Sash were to prevail with their legal actions, our ability to operate our business, specifically our micro-lending and insurance businesses in a commercially viable manner would be impaired, which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and might harm our reputation. Regardless of the outcome, management will be required to devote further time and resources to these legal proceedings, which may impact their ability to focus their attention on our business.. We have been ordered by the High Court to repay to SASSA certain reimbursed implementation costs. We are appealing this decision, but if we are unsuccessful and are ultimately required to repay substantial monies to SASSA, such repayment would adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.. In March 2015, Corruption Watch, a South African non-profit civil society organization, commenced a legal proceeding in the High Court seeking an order by the Court to review and set aside the decision of SASSA's Chief Executive Officer to approve a payment to us of ZAR 317.0 million (approximately ZAR 277 million, excluding VAT) and directing us to repay the aforesaid amount, plus interest. Corruption Watch claimed that there was no lawful basis to make the payment to us, and that the decision was unreasonable and irrational and did not comply with South African legislation. We were named as a respondent in this legal proceeding.. On February 22, 2018, the matter was heard by the Gauteng Division, Pretoria of the High Court of South Africa. On March 23, 2018, the High Court ordered that the June 15, 2012 variation agreement between SASSA and CPS be reviewed and set aside. CPS was ordered to refund ZAR 317.0 million to SASSA, plus interest from June 2014 to date of payment. On April 4, 2018, we filed an application seeking leave to appeal the whole order and judgment of the High Court because we believe that the High Court erred in its application of the law and/or in fact in its findings. On April 25, 2018, the High Court rejected the application seeking leave to appeal. CPS is in the process of filing an application seeking leave to appeal the whole order and judgment of the High Court with the Supreme Court of Appeal. However, we cannot predict whether leave to appeal will be granted or if granted, how the Supreme Court of Appeal will rule on the matter.. In addition, in an April 2014 ruling, the Constitutional Court ordered SASSA to re-run the tender process and required us to file with the Court, after completion of our SASSA contract in March 2017, an audited statement of our expenses, income and net profit under the contract. The March 2018 Constitutional Court order contains a similar requirement that we file an audited statement of our expenses, income and net profit within 30 days of the completion of the contract. We expect to file the required information with the Constitutional Court as ordered. Parties to the March 2018 court proceedings also requested the Constitutional Court to consider further orders, including the repayment of any profits derived by CPS under its SASSA contract. The Constitutional Court did not provide such order in its March 2018 order; however, one or more third parties may in the future institute litigation challenging our right to retain a portion of the amounts we will have received from SASSA under our contract. We cannot predict whether any such litigation will be instituted, or if it is, whether it would be successful.. Any successful challenge to our right to receive and retain payments from SASSA that requires substantial repayments would adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.. 14. The pricing recommended by National Treasury to the Constitutional Court for our services provided at pay points for the period from April 1, 2018 through September 30, 2018, has not yet been approved by the Constitutional Court. If the amount payable to us is not commercially reasonable, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected.. Under the Constitutional Court order of March 23, 2018, related to the extension of the SASSA contract to September 30, 2018 in respect of the recipients paid at cash pay points, we were granted permission to approach National Treasury to request revised pricing of the contract. National Treasury provided a recommendation to the Constitutional Court in compliance with their order at a price per recipient of R51.00 (VAT inclusive) per month. Although we offered to accept this amount in respect of the three months ended June 30, 2018 when the number of recipients paid approximated two million per month, we have asked the Constitutional Court to reconsider the last three months of the contract. Neither the Treasury recommendation or our proposal have been approved by the Constitutional Court to date and as a result we have only recognised revenue at the rate set forth in the original contract since April 1, 2018 while we await an order from the Constitutional Court.. In line with SASSA's public statements, we have seen a material reduction in the number of recipients paid at the pay points during July and August, and this is expected to continue into September. This would result in a material decrease in the revenue from the provision of this service if National Treasury's recommendation is applied and CPS would then operate at an even greater loss for the three months to the end of the contract. If we are unable to reach a commercially reasonable settlement for this period, then this will adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows during the first quarter of fiscal 2019.. In order to meet our obligations under our current SASSA contract, we are required to deposit government funds with financial institutions in South Africa before commencing the payment cycle and are exposed to counterparty risk.. In order to meet our obligations under our current SASSA contract, we are required to deposit government funds, which will ultimately be used to pay social welfare grants, with financial institutions in South Africa before commencing the payment cycle. If these financial institutions are unable to meet their commitments to us, in a timely manner or at all, we would be unable to discharge our obligations under our SASSA contract and could be subject to financial losses, penalties, loss of reputation and potentially, the cancellation of our contract. As we are unable to influence these financial institutions' operations, including their internal information technology structures, capital structures, risk management, business continuity and disaster recovery programs, or their regulatory compliance systems, we are exposed to counterparty risk.. We may undertake acquisitions or make strategic investments that could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive to our business.. Acquisitions and strategic investments are an integral part of our long-term growth strategy as we seek to grow our business internationally and to deploy our technologies in new markets both inside and outside South Africa. However, we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition or investment candidates at prices that we consider appropriate. If we do identify an appropriate acquisition or investment candidate, we may not be able to successfully negotiate the terms of the transaction, finance it or, if the transaction occurs, integrate the new business into our existing business. These transactions may require debt financing or additional equity financing, resulting in additional leverage or dilution of ownership. For instance, in July 2017, we invested in Cell C utilizing a combination of existing cash reserves and external debt from South African banks. Refer to Item 7 - \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Developments During Fiscal 2018 -  CPS and SASSA Contract Termination.\". Acquisitions of businesses or other material operations and the integration of these acquisitions or their businesses will require significant attention from our senior management which may divert their attention from our day to day business. The difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations, integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures. We also may not be able to maintain key employees or customers of an acquired business or realize cost efficiencies or synergies or other benefits that we anticipated when selecting our acquisition candidates.. In addition, we may need to record write-downs from future impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets, which could reduce our future reported earnings. For instance, in March 2018, we recorded an impairment loss of $19.9 million related to the goodwill identified in the Masterpayment and Masterpayment Financial Services acquisitions. Finally, acquisition candidates may have liabilities or adverse operating issues that we fail to discover through due diligence prior to the acquisition.. 15. We may not achieve the expected benefits from our recent Cell C and DNI investments.. We have invested more than $240 million, in aggregate, to acquire a 15% interest in Cell C and a 55% controlling interest in DNI. We believe that there are potential synergies that we can derive from each of these transactions, including the integration of certain of our service offerings with those of Cell C and DNI. However, we may not realize some or any of the benefits we expect to achieve from these investments.. Attempting to integrate these service offerings may be disruptive to us, and we may not be able to integrate these offerings successfully. Even if we are able to achieve this integration, our customers may not use these services to the extent that we expect they will. Any such failure could adversely impact our business or the businesses of Cell C and DNI, which could, in turn, reduce the value of our investments in them. Additionally, attempting to integrate Cell C's and DNI's offerings with our own may adversely impact our other business and operational relationships. Our inability to achieve the expected synergies from the Cell C and DNI transactions may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, Cell C and DNI may not be able to successfully execute their respective business plans, which may adversely affect, or impair, the carrying value of our investments in them.. DNI generates most of its revenue by providing services to or on behalf of Cell C, principally through the sale of mobile phone starter packs. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow would suffer materially if DNI were to lose its contractual relationships with Cell C.. DNI's business comprises of a number of separate entities that are primarily involved in the distribution of mobile phone starter packs, mainly on behalf of Cell C. We also provide funding for the expansion of Cell C's mobile telecommunications infrastructure. If Cell C were to terminate any of these contractual relationships that have multi-year notice periods, it would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow as a consequence of the impact on DNI.. We have indebtedness that requires us to comply with restrictive and financial covenants. If we are unable to comply with these covenants, we could default on this debt, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.. We financed our investments in Cell C and DNI through South African bank borrowings of ZAR 1.46 billion, which has since reduced to ZAR 683.8 million through the Company meeting its scheduled repayments ($49.8 million, translated at exchange rates applicable as of June 30, 2018). The loans are secured by intercompany cross-guarantees and a pledge by Net1 Applied Technologies South Africa Proprietary Limited, or Net1 SA, of its entire equity interests in Cell C and DNI. The terms of the lending arrangement contain customary covenants that require Net1 SA to remain below a specified total net leverage ratio and restrict the ability of Net1 SA, and certain of its subsidiaries to make certain distributions with respect to their capital stock, prepay other debt, encumber their assets, incur additional indebtedness, make investment above specified levels, engage in certain business combinations and engage in other corporate activities without the approval of the lenders.. In addition, DNI has obtained a three year revolving credit facility of ZAR 200 million ($14.6 million, translated at exchange rates applicable as of June 30, 2018) from Rand Merchant Bank, a division of FirstRand Bank Limited, a South African bank, to expand its operations. The revolving credit facility is secured by intercompany cross-guarantees within the DNI group and a pledge by DNI of its entire equity interests in its subsidiaries. The terms of the lending arrangement contain customary covenants that require DNI to remain in accordance with specified net senior debt to EBITDA and EBITDA to net senior interest ratios and restrict the ability of DNI, and certain of its subsidiaries to make certain distributions with respect to their capital stock, prepay other debt, encumber their assets, incur additional indebtedness, make investment above specified levels, engage in certain business combinations and engage in other corporate activities without the approval of the lenders.. Although these covenants only apply to certain of our South African subsidiaries, these security arrangements and covenants may reduce our operating flexibility or our ability to engage in other transactions that may be beneficial to us. If we are unable to comply with the covenants in South Africa, we could be in default and the indebtedness could be accelerated. If this were to occur, we might not be able to obtain waivers of default or to refinance the debt with another lender and as a result, our business and financial condition would suffer.. 16. We may be unable to secure the necessary facilities that will enable us to maintain the cash requirements for our ATM network. The expansion of our fixed and mobile ATM network, along with an increase in our EPE client base, necessitates access to large amounts of cash to stock the ATM's and maintain uninterrupted service levels. While we have been able to operate our ATM's using our surplus cash and existing general credit facilities, any significant reduction in our available cash reserves or general credit facilities, or our failure to increase our facilities if required, will have an adverse impact on our ability to continue uninterrupted operation of our ATM network and our profits from this business. We will also suffer reputational damage if our service levels are negatively impacted due to the unavailability of cash.. We face competition from the incumbent retail banks in South Africa and SAPO in the unbanked market segment, which could limit growth in our transaction-based activities segment.. Certain South African banks have also developed their own low-cost banking products targeted at the unbanked and under-banked market segment. According to the 2016 FinScope survey, which is an annual survey conducted by the FinMark Trust, a non-profit independent trust, 77% of South Africans are banked (58% if SASSA account holders are excluded). As the competition to bank the unbanked in South Africa intensifies, we may not be successful in marketing our low-cost EasyPay Everywhere product to our target population. Moreover, as our product offerings increase, gain market acceptance and pose a competitive threat in South Africa, especially our UEPS/EMV product with biometric verification and our financial services offerings, the banks and SAPO may seek governmental or other regulatory intervention if they view us as disrupting their transactional or other businesses.. Our microlending loan book exposes us to credit risk and our allowance for doubtful finance loans receivable may not be sufficient to absorb future write-offs.. All of these microfinance loans made are for a period of six months or less. We have created an allowance for doubtful finance loans receivable related to this book. Management has considered factors including the period of the finance loan outstanding, creditworthiness of the customers and the past payment history of the borrower when creating the allowance. We consider this policy to be appropriate taking into account factors such as historical bad debts, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns. However, additional allowances may be required should the ability of our customers to make payments when due deteriorate in the future. A significant amount of judgment is required to assess the ultimate recoverability of these finance loan receivables, including on-going evaluation of the creditworthiness of each customer.. Furthermore, since the commencement of SASSA's process of transitioning grant recipients to SAPO accounts, we have seen an increased incidence of our customers changing their primary bank accounts to other commercial banks or to SAPO. This has increased our recoverability risk and the risk that out allowance is insufficient.. Our working capital financing and supply chain solutions receivables expose us to credit risk and our allowance for doubtful working capital finance loans receivable may not be sufficient to absorb future write-offs.. We have created an allowance for doubtful working capital finance receivables related to our Mastertrading business and our Korean lending activities. We have considered factors including the period of the working capital receivable outstanding, creditworthiness of the customers and the past payment history of the borrower when creating the allowance. A significant amount of judgment is required to assess the ultimate recoverability of these and other working capital finance receivables because these are new offerings and we continue to refine and improve our processes, including the maximum amount of exposure per customer that we are willing to accept and the on-going evaluation of the creditworthiness of each customer.. A determination that requires a change in our allowance for doubtful working capital finance receivables, or a failure by one or more of our customers to pay a significant portion of outstanding working capital finance receivables, could have a negative impact on our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.. 17. We may face competition from other companies that offer innovative payment technologies and payment processing, which could result in the loss of our existing business and adversely impact our ability to successfully market additional products and services.. Our primary competitors in the payment processing market include other independent processors, as well as financial institutions, independent sales organizations, and, potentially card networks. Many of our competitors are companies who are larger than we are and have greater financial and operational resources than we have. These factors may allow them to offer better pricing terms or incentives to customers, which could result in a loss of our potential or current customers or could force us to lower our prices as well. Either of these actions could have a significant effect on our revenues and earnings.. In addition to competition that our UEPS system faces from the use of cash, checks, credit and debit cards, existing payment systems and the providers of financial services and low cost bank accounts, there are a number of other products that use smart card technology in connection with a funds transfer system. During the past several years, smart card technology has become increasingly prevalent. We believe that the most competitive product in this marketplace is EMV, a system that is promoted by most of the major card companies such as Visa, MasterCard, JCB and American Express. Also, governments and financial institutions are, to an increasing extent, implementing general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards as a low-cost alternative to provide financial services to the unbanked population. Moreover, as the acceptance of using a mobile phone to facilitate financial services has increased exponentially, other companies have introduced such services to the marketplace successfully and customers may prefer those services to ours, based on technology, price or other factors.. A prolonged economic slowdown or lengthy or severe recession in South Africa or elsewhere could harm our operations.. A prolonged economic downturn or recession could materially impact our results from operations. A recessionary economic environment could have a negative impact on mobile phone operators, our cardholders and retailers and could reduce the level of transactions we process, the sales of mobile phone starter packs, the take-up of the financial services we offer and the ability of our customers to repay our microloans or to pay their insurance premiums, which would, in turn, negatively impact our financial results. If financial institutions and retailers experience decreased demand for their products and services our hardware, software and related technology sales will reduce, resulting in lower revenue.. The loss of the services of certain of our executive officers would adversely affect our business.. Our future financial and operational performance depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management, in particular, Mr. Herman Kotzé, our Chief Executive Officer. Many of our key responsibilities in South Africa are currently performed by Mr. Kotzé, as well as by Messrs. Nanda Pillay, our Managing Director: Southern Africa and Nitin Soma, our Senior Vice President of Information Technology. The loss of the services of any of these executives would disrupt our development efforts or business relationships and our ability to continue to innovate and to meet customers' needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.. The success of our KSNET business depends heavily on the continued services of its president, Phil-Hyun Oh and the other senior members of the KSNET management team. In addition, the growth and future profitability of IPG is reliant on Mr. Philip Meyer's leadership, industry knowledge and contacts. We do not maintain any \"key person\" life insurance policies.. Similarly following the completion of our acquisition of DNI, the success of that business is heavily dependent on the continued involvement of Messrs. Andrew Dunn and Dave Smaldon and other senior officers of the DNI group of companies who have successfully built the business to its current position and are critical to its continued success.. We face a highly competitive employment market and may not be successful in attracting and retaining a sufficient number of skilled employees, particularly in the technical and sales areas and senior management.. Our future success depends on our ability to continue to develop new products and to market these products to our target users. In order to succeed in our product development and marketing efforts, we need to identify, attract, motivate and retain sufficient numbers of qualified technical and sales personnel. An inability to hire and retain such technical personnel would adversely affect our ability to enhance our existing intellectual property, to introduce new generations of technology and to keep abreast of current developments in technology. Demand for personnel with the range of capabilities and experience we require is high and there is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining these employees. The risk exists that our technical skills and sales base may be depleted over time because of natural attrition. Furthermore, social and economic factors in South Africa have led, and continue to lead, to numerous qualified individuals leaving the country, thus depleting the availability of qualified personnel in South Africa. In addition, our multi-country strategy will also require us to hire and retain highly qualified managerial personnel in each of these markets.. 18. If we cannot recruit and retain people with the appropriate capabilities and experience and effectively integrate these people into our business, it could negatively affect our product development and marketing activities.. System failures, including breaches in the security of our system, could harm our business.. We may experience system failures from time to time, and any lengthy interruption in the availability of our back-end system computer could harm our revenues and profits, and could subject us to the scrutiny of our customers.. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers and users to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to avoid our technology altogether, and could permanently harm our reputation and brands. These interruptions would increase the burden on our engineering staff, which, in turn, could delay our introduction of new applications and services. Finally, because our customers may use our products for critical transactions, any system failures could result in damage to our customers' businesses. These customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses. Even if unsuccessful, this type of claim could be time consuming and costly for us to address.. Although our systems have been designed to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.. Protection against fraud is of key importance to the purchasers and end users of our solutions. We incorporate security features, including encryption software, biometric identification and secure hardware, into our solutions to protect against fraud in electronic transactions and to provide for the privacy and integrity of card holder data. Our solutions may be vulnerable to breaches in security due to defects in the security mechanisms, the operating system and applications or the hardware platform. Security vulnerabilities could jeopardize the security of information transmitted using our solutions. If the security of our solutions is compromised, our reputation and marketplace acceptance of our solutions will be adversely affected, which would cause our business to suffer, and we may become subject to damage claims. We have not yet experienced any significant security breaches affecting our business.. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems with our system could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Our current business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures.. The period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the sale of our UEPS products or services to that customer tends to be long and may be subject to delays, which may have an impact on our revenues.. The period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the purchase of our UEPS products and services is often long and subject to delays associated with the budgeting, approval and competitive evaluation processes that frequently accompany significant capital expenditures. A lengthy sales cycle may have an impact on the timing of our revenues, which may cause our quarterly operating results to fall below investor expectations. A customer's decision to purchase our products and services is often discretionary, involves a significant commitment of resources, and is influenced by customer budgetary cycles. To sell our products and services successfully we generally must educate our potential customers regarding the uses and benefits of our products and services, which can require the expenditure of significant time and resources; however, there can be no assurance that this significant expenditure of time and resources will result in actual sales of our products and services.. Our proprietary rights may not adequately protect our technologies.. Our success depends in part on our obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark protection of our technologies in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as successfully enforcing this intellectual property and defending this intellectual property against third-party challenges. We will only be able to protect our technologies from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable intellectual property protections, such as patents or trade secrets, cover them. In particular, we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes. Furthermore, the degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage.. We cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. For example, we might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our patents and patent applications or to file patent applications and it is possible that none of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents. It is possible that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies. Also, our issued patents may not provide a basis for commercially viable products, or may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties.. 19. We also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We have confidentiality agreements with employees, and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how. These agreements may be breached and or may not have adequate remedies for such breach. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants or others may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. If we were to enforce a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, our enforcement efforts would be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome would be unpredictable. Moreover, if our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, it will be more difficult for us to enforce our rights and our business could be harmed. If we are not able to defend the patent or trade secret protection position of our technologies, then we will not be able to exclude competitors from developing or marketing competing technologies.. We also rely on trademarks to establish a market identity for some of our products. To maintain the value of our trademarks, we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks. Also, we might not obtain registrations for our pending trademark applications, and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending trademark applications from challenge by third parties.. Defending our intellectual property rights or defending ourselves in infringement suits that may be brought against us is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful.. Litigation to enforce our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets could result in substantial costs and may not be successful. Any loss of, or inability to protect, intellectual property in our technology could diminish our competitive advantage and also seriously harm our business. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws in countries where we currently have patent protection. Our means of protecting our intellectual property rights in countries where we currently have patent or trademark protection, or any other country in which we operate, may not be adequate to fully protect our intellectual property rights. Similarly, if third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights, we may be required to incur significant costs and devote substantial resources to the defense of such claims. We may be required to discontinue using and selling any infringing technology and services, to expend resources to develop non-infringing technology or to purchase licenses or pay royalties for other technology. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in defending any such third-party claims, we could suffer costly judgments and injunctions that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.. Our strategy of partnering with companies outside South Africa may not be successful.. In order for us to expand our operations into foreign markets, it may be necessary for us to establish partnering arrangements with companies outside South Africa, such as the one we have co-established in Namibia and our non-controlling investments in Nigeria, Liechtenstein and India. The success of these endeavors is, however, subject to a number of factors over which we have little or no control, such as finding suitable partners with the appropriate financial, business and technical backing and continued governmental support for planned implementations. In some countries, finding suitable partners and obtaining the appropriate support from the government involved may take a number of years before we can commence implementation. Some of these partnering arrangements may take the form of joint ventures in which we receive a non-controlling interest. Non-controlling ownership carries with it numerous risks, including dependence on partners to provide knowledge of local market conditions and to facilitate the acquisition of any necessary licenses and permits, as well as the inability to control the joint venture vehicle and to direct its policies and strategies.. Such a lack of control could result in the loss of all or part of our investment in such entities. In addition, our foreign partners may have different business methods and customs which may be unfamiliar to us and with which we disagree. Our joint venture partners may not be able to implement our business model in new areas as efficiently and quickly as we have been able to do in South Africa. Furthermore, limitations imposed on our South African subsidiaries by South African exchange control regulations, as well as limitations imposed on us by the Investment Company Act of 1940, may limit our ability to establish partnerships or entities in which we do not obtain a controlling interest.. We pre-fund certain merchant and customer payments in South Africa and South Korea and a significant level of payment defaults by these merchants or customers would adversely affect us.. We pre-fund social welfare grants through the merchants who participate in our merchant acquiring system in the South African provinces where we operate. We also pre-fund the settlement of funds to certain customers in South Korea. These pre-funding obligations expose us to the risk of default by these merchants and customers. Although we have not experienced any material defaults by merchants or customers in the return of pre-funded amounts to us, we cannot guarantee that material defaults will not occur in the future. A material level of merchant or customer defaults could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial position and results of operations. We expect this risk to remain after the conclusion of the SASSA contract as we will continue to service our EasyPay Everywhere cardholders and our financial services branch and ATM networks.. 20. We may incur material losses in connection with our distribution of cash through our payment infrastructure in South Africa.. Many cardholders use our services to access cash using their debit cards. We use armored vehicles and our own fixed ATM infrastructure to deliver large amounts of cash to rural areas across South Africa to enable these cardholders to receive this cash. In some cases, we also store the cash that will be delivered by the armored vehicles in depots overnight or over the weekend to facilitate delivery to these rural areas. We cannot insure against certain risks of loss or theft of cash from our delivery vehicles, ATMs or depots and we will therefore bear the full cost of certain uninsured losses or theft in connection with the cash handling process, and such losses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. We have not incurred any material losses resulting from cash distribution in recent years, but there is no assurance that we will not incur material losses in the future.. We depend upon third-party suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations, which could harm our business.. We obtain our smart cards, ATMs, POS devices and the other hardware we use in our business from a limited number of suppliers, and do not manufacture this equipment ourselves. We generally do not have long-term agreements with our manufacturers or component suppliers. If our suppliers become unwilling or unable to provide us with adequate supplies of parts or products when we need them, or if they increase their prices, we may not be able to find alternative sources in a timely manner and could be faced with a critical shortage. This could harm our ability to implement new systems and cause our revenues to decline. Even if we are able to secure alternative sources in a timely manner, our costs could increase. A supply interruption or an increase in demand beyond current suppliers' capabilities could harm our ability to distribute our equipment and thus, to acquire a new source of customers who use our UEPS technology. Any interruption in the supply of the hardware necessary to operate our technology, or our inability to obtain substitute equipment at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business.. Our Smart Life business exposes us to risks typically experienced by life assurance companies.. Smart Life is a life insurance company and exposes us to risks typically experienced by life assurance companies. Some of these risks include the extent to which we are able to continue to reinsure our risks at acceptable costs, reinsurer counterparty risk, maintaining regulatory capital adequacy, solvency and liquidity requirements, our ability to price our insurance products appropriately, the risk that actual claims experience may exceed our estimates, the ability to recover policy premiums from our customers and the competitiveness of the South African insurance market. If we are unable to maintain our desired level of reinsurance at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our exposure risk or reduce our insurance writings. If our reinsurers are unable to meet their commitments to us in a timely manner, or at all, we may be unable to discharge our obligations under our insurance contracts. As such, we are exposed to counterparty, including credit, risk of these reinsurers. Our product pricing includes long-term assumptions regarding investment returns, mortality, morbidity, persistency and operating costs and expenses of the business. Using the wrong assumptions to price our insurance products could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.. If our actual claims experience is higher than our estimates, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Finally, the South African insurance industry is highly competitive. Many of our competitors are well-established, represented nationally and market similar products and we may not be able to effectively penetrate the South African insurance market.. Risks Relating to Operating in South Africa and Other Foreign Markets. If we do not achieve applicable broad-based black economic empowerment objectives in our South African businesses, we risk losing our government and/or private contracts and/or risk not being in compliance with any government and/or private contracts which we have already entered into. In addition, it is possible that we may be required to increase the black shareholding of our company in a manner that could dilute your ownership and/or change the companies from which we purchase goods or procure services (to companies with a better BEE Contributor Status Level).. The legislative framework for the promotion of broad-based black economic empowerment, or BEE, in South Africa has been established through the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act, No. 53 of 2003, as amended from time to time, and the Amended BEE Codes of Good Practice, 2013, or BEE Codes, any sector-specific codes of good practice, or Sector Codes, published pursuant thereto. Sector Codes are fully binding between and among businesses operating in a sector for which a Sector Code has been published. Achievement of BEE objectives is measured by a scorecard which establishes a weighting for the various elements.. 21. Save for certain exempt entities (for example, micro enterprises and qualifying small enterprises), scorecards are independently reviewed by accredited BEE verification agencies which issue a certificate that presents an entity's BEE Contributor Status Level.. Certain of our South African businesses are subject to either the Information, Communications and Technology Sector Code, or ICT Sector Code, or the Financial Services Sector Code. The ICT Sector Code has been amended and aligned with the new BEE Codes, and was promulgated on November 7, 2016. Likewise, the Financial Service Sector Code has been amended and aligned with the new BEE Codes, and was promulgated on December 1, 2017.. We have taken a number of actions as a company to increase empowerment of black (as defined under applicable regulations) South Africans. However, it is possible that these actions may not be sufficient to enable us to achieve applicable BEE objectives. In that event, in order to avoid risking the loss of our government and private contracts, we may have to seek to comply through other means, including by selling or placing additional shares of Net1 or of our South African subsidiaries to black South Africans (either directly or indirectly). Such sales or placements of shares could have a dilutive impact on your ownership interest, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline.. We expect that our BEE Contributor Status Level will be important for us in order to remain competitive in the South African marketplace and we continually seek ways to improve our BEE Contributor Status Level, especially the ownership (so-called \"equity element\") element thereof. For instance, in April 2014, we implemented a BEE transaction pursuant to which we issued 4.4 million shares of our common stock to our BEE partners for ZAR 60.00 per share, which represented a 25% discount to the market price of our shares at the time that we negotiated the transaction. We entered into this transaction to improve our scoring on the ownership (equity) element of our BEE scorecard. We provided funding to the BEE partners in order for them to buy these shares from us. In June 2014, and in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreements, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million of these shares of our common stock in order for the BEE partners to repay the loans we provided to them. Furthermore, in August 2014, we entered into a Subscription and Sale of Shares Agreement with Business Venture Investments No 1567 Proprietary Limited (RF), or BVI, one of our BEE partners, in preparation for any new potential SASSA tender. Pursuant to the aforesaid agreement, we repurchased BVI's remaining shares of Net1 common stock and BVI subscribed for new ordinary shares of CPS, representing approximately 12.5% of CPS' ordinary shares outstanding after the subscription.. It is possible that we may find it necessary to issue additional shares to improve our BEE Contributor Status Level. If we enter into further BEE transactions that involve the issuance of equity, we cannot predict what the dilutive effect of such a transaction would be on your ownership or how it would affect the market price of our stock.. Fluctuations in the value of the South African rand have had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our reported results of operations, which may make it difficult to evaluate our business performance between reporting periods and may also adversely affect our stock price.. The South African rand, or ZAR, is the primary operating currency for our business operations while our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars. This means that as long as the ZAR remains our primary operating currency, depreciation in the ZAR against the U.S. dollar, and to a lesser extent, the South Korean won against the U.S. dollar, would negatively impact our reported revenue and net income, while a strengthening of the ZAR and the South Korean won would have the opposite effect. Depreciation in the ZAR may negatively impact the prices at which our stock trades. The U.S. dollar/ZAR exchange rate has historically been volatile and we expect this volatility to continue. We provide detailed information about historical exchange rates in Item 7 - \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Currency Exchange Rate Information.\". Due to the significant fluctuation in the value of the ZAR and its impact on our reported results, you may find it difficult to compare our results of operations between financial reporting periods even though we provide supplemental information about our results of operations determined on a ZAR basis. This difficulty may increase as we expand our business internationally and record additional revenue and expenses in the euro and other currencies. It may also have a negative impact on our stock price.. We generally do not engage in any currency hedging transactions intended to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations, other than economic hedging relating to our inventory purchases which are settled in U.S. dollars or euros. We have used forward contracts in order to hedge our economic exposure to the ZAR/U.S. dollar and ZAR/euro exchange rate fluctuations from these foreign currency transactions. We cannot guarantee that we will enter into hedging transactions in the future or, if we do, that these transactions will successfully protect us against currency fluctuations.. 22. South Africa's high levels of poverty, unemployment and crime may increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain a qualified workforce.. While South Africa has a highly developed financial and legal infrastructure, it also has high levels of crime and unemployment, relative to peer countries in Africa and other emerging economies, and there are significant differences in the level of economic and social development among its people, with large parts of the population, particularly in the rural areas, having limited access to adequate education, healthcare, housing and other basic services, including water and electricity. In addition, South Africa has a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Government policies aimed at alleviating and redressing the disadvantages suffered by the majority of citizens under previous governments may increase our costs and reduce our profitability, all of which could negatively affect our business. These problems may prompt emigration of skilled workers, hinder investment into South Africa and impede economic growth. As a result, we may have difficulties attracting and retaining qualified employees.. We may not be able to effectively and efficiently manage the electricity supply disruptions in South Africa, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and future growth.. Our businesses in South Africa are dependent on electricity generated and supplied by the state-owned utility, Eskom, in order to operate. In recent years, Eskom has been unable to generate and supply the amount of electricity required by South Africans, and the entire country experienced significant and largely unpredictable electricity supply disruptions. Eskom has implemented a number of short- and long-term mitigation plans to correct these issues and the number of supply disruptions has decreased since calendar 2016.. As part of our business continuity programs, we have installed back-up diesel generators in order for us to continue to operate our core data processing facilities in Cape Town and Johannesburg in the event of intermittent disruptions to our electricity supply. We have to perform regular monitoring and maintenance of these generators as well as sourcing and managing diesel fuel levels. We may also be required to replace these generators on a more frequent basis due to the additional burden placed on them.. Our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and future growth could be adversely affected if Eskom is unable to commission new electricity-generating power stations in accordance with its plans, or at all, or if we are unable to effectively and efficiently test, maintain, source fuel for and replace our generators.. The economy of South Africa is exposed to high inflation and interest rates, which could increase our operating costs and thereby reduce our profitability.. The economy of South Africa in the past has been, and in the future may continue to be, characterized by rates of inflation and interest rates that are substantially higher than those prevailing in the United States and other highly developed economies. High rates of inflation could increase our South African-based costs and decrease our operating margins. Higher interest rates increase the cost of our debt financing, though conversely they also increase the amount of income we earn on any cash balances.. South African exchange control regulations could hinder our ability to make foreign investments and obtain foreign-denominated financing.. South Africa's exchange control regulations restrict the export of capital from South Africa, the Republic of Namibia and the Kingdoms of Lesotho and Swaziland, known collectively as the Common Monetary Area, without the prior approval of SARB. While the South African government has relaxed exchange controls in recent years, it is difficult to predict whether or how it will further relax or abolish exchange control measures in the foreseeable future.. Although Net1 is a U.S. corporation and is not itself subject to South African exchange control regulations, these regulations do restrict the ability of our South African subsidiaries to raise and deploy capital outside the Common Monetary Area, to borrow money in currencies other than the South African rand and to hold foreign currency. Exchange control restrictions may also affect the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends to Net1 unless the affected subsidiary can show that any payment of such dividend will not place it in an over-borrowed position. As of June 30, 2018, approximately 54% of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our South African subsidiaries. Exchange control regulations could make it difficult for our South African subsidiaries to: (i) export capital from South Africa; (ii) hold foreign currency or incur indebtedness denominated in foreign currencies without the approval of SARB; (iii) acquire an interest in a foreign venture without the approval of SARB and first having complied with the investment criteria of SARB; or (iv) repatriate to South Africa profits of foreign operations. These regulations could also limit our ability to utilize profits of one foreign business to finance operations of a different foreign business.. 23. Under current exchange control regulations, SARB approval would be required for any acquisition of our company which would involve payment to our South African shareholders of any consideration other than South African rand. This restriction could limit our management in its ability to consider strategic options and thus, our shareholders may not be able to realize the premium over the current trading price of our shares.. Most of South Africa's major industries are unionized, and the majority of employees belong to trade unions. We face the risk of disruption from labor disputes and new South African labor laws.. Trade unions have had a significant impact on the collective bargaining process as well as on social and political reform in South Africa in general. Although only approximately 1% percent of our South African workforce is unionized and we have not experienced any labor disruptions in recent years, such labor disruptions may occur in the future. In addition, developments in South African labor laws may increase our costs or alter our relationship with our employees and trade unions, which may have an adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our operations.. Operating in South Africa and other emerging markets subjects us to greater risks than those we would face if we operated in more developed markets.. Emerging markets such as South Africa, as well as some of the other markets into which we have recently begun to expand, including African countries outside South Africa, South and Southeast Asia and Central Europe, are subject to greater risks than more developed markets.. While we focus our business primarily on emerging markets because that is where we perceive to be the greatest opportunities to market our products and services successfully, the political, economic and market conditions in many of these markets present risks that could make it more difficult to operate our business successfully.. Some of these risks include:. -              political and economic instability, including higher       rates of inflation and currency fluctuations;       -              high levels of corruption, including bribery of public       officials;       -              loss due to civil strife, acts of war or terrorism,       guerrilla activities and insurrection;       -              a lack of well-developed legal systems which could make       it difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property and contractual       rights;       -              logistical, utilities (including electricity and water       supply) and communications challenges;       -              potential adverse changes in laws and regulatory       practices, including import and export license requirements and       restrictions, tariffs, legal structures and tax laws;       -              difficulties in staffing and managing operations and       ensuring the safety of our employees;       -              restrictions on the right to convert or repatriate       currency or export assets;       -              greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer       collection cycles;       -              indigenization and empowerment programs;       -              exposure to liability under the U.K. Bribery Act; and           -              exposure to liability under U.S. securities and foreign       trade laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and       regulations established by the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of       Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC.. Many of these countries and regions are in various stages of developing institutions and political, legal and regulatory systems that are characteristic of democracies. However, institutions in these countries and regions may not yet be as firmly established as they are in democracies in the developed world. Many of these countries and regions are also in the process of transitioning to a market economy and, as a result, are experiencing changes in their economies and their government policies that can affect our investments in these countries and regions. Moreover, the procedural safeguards of the new legal and regulatory regimes in these countries and regions are still being developed and, therefore, existing laws and regulations may be applied inconsistently. In some circumstances, it may not be possible to obtain the legal remedies provided under those laws and regulations in a timely manner.. As the political, economic and legal environments remain subject to continuous development, investors in these countries and regions face uncertainty as to the security of their investments. Any unexpected changes in the political or economic conditions in these or neighboring countries or others in the region may have a material adverse effect on the international investments that we have made or may make in the future, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.. 24. Risks Relating to Government Regulation. The South African National Credit Regulator has applied to cancel the registration of our subsidiary, Moneyline Financial Services (Pty) Ltd, as a credit provider. If the registration is cancelled, we will not be able to provide loans to our customers, which would harm our business.. Moneyline provides microloans to our EasyPay Everywhere cardholders. Moneyline is a registered credit provider under the South African National Credit Act, or NCA, and is required to comply with the NCA in the operation of its lending business. In September 2014, the South African National Credit Regulator, or NCR, applied to the National Consumer Tribunal to cancel Moneyline's registration, based on an investigation concluded by the NCR.. The NCR has alleged, among other things, that Moneyline contravened the NCA by including child support grants and foster child grants in the affordability assessments performed by Moneyline prior to granting credit to these borrowers, and that the procedures followed and documentation maintained by Moneyline are not in accordance with the NCA. We believe that Moneyline has conducted its business in compliance with NCA and we are opposing the NCR's application. However, if the NCR's application is successful, Moneyline would be prohibited from operating its microlending business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.. We are required to comply with certain U.S. laws and regulations, including economic and trade sanctions, which could adversely impact our future growth.. We are subject to U.S. and other trade controls, economic sanctions and similar laws and regulations, including those in the jurisdictions where we operate. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to civil, criminal and administrative penalties and harm our reputation. Doing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of various foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations place restrictions on our operations, trade practices, partners and investment decisions. In particular, our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign trade control laws and regulations, including various export controls and economic sanctions programs, such as those administered by OFAC, as well as European sanctions. We monitor compliance in accordance with the 10 principles as set out in the United Nations Global Compact Principles, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development recommendations relating to corruption, and the International Labor Organization Protocol in terms of certain of the items to be monitored. As a result of doing business in foreign countries and with foreign partners, we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating trade control laws as well as sanctions regulations.. Economic sanctions programs restrict our business dealings with certain sanctioned countries, persons and entities. In addition, because we act through dealers and distributors, we face the risk that our dealers, distributors and customers might further distribute our products to a sanctioned person or entity, or an ultimate end-user in a sanctioned country, which might subject us to an investigation concerning compliance with OFAC or other sanctions regulations.. Violations of trade control laws and sanctions regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We have developed policies and procedures as part of a company-wide compliance program that is designed to assist our compliance with applicable U.S. and international trade control laws and regulations, including trade controls and sanctions programs administered by OFAC, and provide regular training to our employees to comply with these laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, consultants, partners, agents or other associated persons will not take actions in violation of our policies and these laws and regulations, or that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, or provide a defense to any alleged violation. In particular, we may be held liable for the actions that our local, strategic or joint venture partners take inside or outside of the United States, even though our partners may not be subject to these laws. Such a violation, even if our policies prohibit it, could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Our continued international expansion, including in developing countries, and our development of new partnerships and joint venture relationships worldwide, could increase the risk of OFAC violations in the future.. We are required to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the FCPA and U.K. Bribery Act, in the jurisdictions in which we operate our business, which could adversely impact our future growth.. The FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business, or securing any improper business advantage. It also requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions. As part of our business, we may deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees of which are considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA.. 25. In addition, we have to comply with the U.K. Bribery Act, or the U.K. Bribery Act, which includes provisions that extend beyond bribery of foreign public officials and also apply to transactions with individuals not employed by a government. The provisions of the U.K. Bribery Act are also more onerous than the FCPA in a number of other respects, including jurisdiction, non-exemption of facilitation payments and penalties. Some of the international locations in which we operate, lack a developed legal system and have higher than normal levels of corruption.. Any failure by us to adopt appropriate compliance procedures and ensure that our employees, agents and business partners comply with the FCPA could subject us to substantial penalties. In addition, the requirement that we comply with the FCPA could put us at a competitive disadvantage with companies that are not required to comply with the FCPA or could otherwise harm our business. For example, in many emerging markets, there may be significant levels of official corruption, and thus, bribery of public officials may be a commonly accepted cost of doing business. Our refusal to engage in illegal behavior, such as paying bribes, may result in us not being able to obtain business that we might otherwise have been able to secure or possibly even result in unlawful, selective or arbitrary action being taken against us by foreign officials.. Our current and potential competitors may use U.S. laws and regulations, including the FCPA, to disrupt our business operations and harm our reputation in the territories in which we operate or in which we intend to expand into. For instance, as we have previously reported, in November 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice commenced an investigation into whether we violated the FCPA and other U.S. federal criminal laws by engaging in a scheme to make corrupt payments to officials of the South Africa government in connection with securing our 2012 SASSA contract and whether we violated federal securities laws in connection with statements made by us in our SEC filings regarding this contract. The investigations commenced as a result of reports made to the relevant U.S. authorities by a losing bidder to the 2012 SASSA contract. While these investigations have all been concluded with no adverse findings against us, during the course of the investigations, management's time was diverted from other matters relating to our business and we suffered harm to our business reputation. Furthermore, in fiscal 2013, the FSB suspended Smart Life's insurance license. Our management has to spend a disproportionate amount of time explaining the circumstances surrounding, and the result of the investigations, when engaging new business partners, shareholders or regulators.. Violations of anti-corruption laws and regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We have developed policies and procedures as part of a company-wide compliance program that is designed to assist our compliance with applicable U.S. and international anti-corruption laws and regulations, and provide regular training to our employees to comply with these laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, consultants, partners, agents or other associated persons will not take actions in violation of our policies and these laws and regulations, or that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, or provide a defense to any alleged violation. In particular, we may be held liable for the actions that our local, strategic or joint venture partners take inside or outside of the United States, even though our partners may not be subject to these laws. Such a violation, even if our policies prohibit it, could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.. Since less developed countries present some of the best opportunities for us to expand our business internationally, restrictions against entering into transactions with those foreign countries, as well as with certain entities and individuals in those countries, can adversely affect our ability to grow our business.. Changes in current South African government regulations relating to social welfare grants could adversely affect our revenues and cash flows.. We derive a substantial portion of our current business from the provision of financial and other services to social grant recipients. Because social welfare eligibility and grant amounts are regulated by the South African government, any changes to or reinterpretations of the government regulations relating to social welfare may result in the non-renewal or reduction of grants for certain individuals, or a determination that currently eligible social welfare grant recipient cardholders are no longer eligible. If any of these changes were to occur, this could result in a reduction of our revenue, profits and cash flows.. We do not have a South African banking license and, therefore, we provide our social welfare grant distribution and EasyPay Everywhere solution through an arrangement with a third-party bank, which limits our control over this business and the economic benefit we derive from it. If this arrangement were to terminate, we would not be able to operate our social welfare grant distribution and EasyPay Everywhere business without alternate means of access to a banking license.. The South African retail banking market is highly regulated. Under current law and regulations, our South African social welfare grant distribution and EasyPay Everywhere business activities requires us to be registered as a bank in South Africa or to have access to an existing banking license.. 26. We are not currently so registered, but we have an agreement with Grindrod Bank that enables us to implement our social welfare grant distribution and EasyPay Everywhere solution in compliance with the relevant laws and regulations. If the agreement were to be terminated, we would not be able to operate these services unless we were able to obtain access to a banking license through alternate means. We are also dependent on Grindrod Bank to defend us against attacks from the other South African banks who may regard the rapid market acceptance of our UEPS/EMV product with biometric verification as disruptive to their funds transfer or other businesses and may seek governmental or other regulatory intervention. Furthermore, we have to comply with the strict anti-money laundering and customer identification regulations of the SARB when we open new bank accounts for our customers and when they transact. Failure to effectively implement and monitor these regulations may result in significant fines or prosecution of Grindrod Bank and ourselves.. In addition, the South African Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, 2002, requires persons who act as intermediaries between financial product suppliers and consumers in South Africa to register as financial service providers. Smart Life was granted an Authorized Financial Service Provider, or FSP, license on June 9, 2015, and Moneyline Financial Services (Pty) Ltd and Net1 Mobile Solutions (Pty) Ltd were each granted FSP licenses on July 11, 2017. If our FSP licenses are cancelled, we may be stopped from continuing our financial services businesses in South Africa.. Our payment processing businesses are subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements.. Our payment processing activities are subject to extensive regulation. Compliance with the requirements under the various regulatory regimes may cause us to incur significant additional costs and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability.. We may be subject to regulations regarding privacy, data use and/or security, which could adversely affect our business.. We are subject to regulations in a number of the countries in which we operate relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information about the people who use our products and services, in particular, \"Know Your Customer\", personal financial and health information. New laws in this area, such as GDPR, have been passed by several jurisdictions, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. The interpretation and application of user data protection laws are in a state of flux. These laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and our current data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with those interpretations and applications. Complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.. The General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, took effect on May 25, 2018, in the European Union and introduced direct compliance obligations for data controllers and data processors. National Data Protection Agencies, or NDPAs, are now able to impose fines for violations ranging from 2% to 4% of annual worldwide turnover, or 10 million to 20 million euro, whichever is greater. NDPAs have the power to carry out audits, request information, and obtain access to premises. Businesses must be able to demonstrate that the personal data of any data subject can be lawfully processed on one of the six specified grounds. The GDPR adopts a risk-based approach to compliance, under which businesses bear responsibility for assessing the degree of risk that their processing activities pose to data subjects. Businesses are required to perform data protection impact assessments before any processing that uses new technology and is likely to result in a high risk to data subjects. The GDPR requires businesses to maintain records of their processing activities. Clear rules around data breach notifications and the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific individual have been set out by the GDPR. In addition, under the GDPR, data subjects have new rights, for example, the right to request that businesses delete their personal data (the right to be forgotten); to object to their personal data being processed; and to obtain a copy of their personal data within a set time frame.. Complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any regulatory requirements or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity and adversely affect us. In addition, as noted above, we are subject to the possibility of security breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these laws.. 27. Risks Relating to our Common Stock. Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.. Our stock price has experienced recent significant volatility. During the 2018 fiscal year, our stock price ranged from a low of $8.05 to a high of $13.20. We expect that the trading price of our common stock may continue to be volatile as a result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to the following:. -              any adverse developments in litigation or regulatory       actions in which we are involved;       -              fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly the       U.S. dollar/ZAR exchange rate;       -              announcement of additional BEE transactions, especially       one involving the issuance or potential issuance of equity securities or       dilution or sale of our existing business in South Africa;       -              quarterly variations in our operating results, especially       if our operating results fall below the expectations of securities       analysts and investors;       -              announcements of acquisitions, disposals or impairments       of intangible assets;       -              the timing of or delays in the commencement,       implementation or completion of investments or major projects;       -              large purchases or sales of our common stock;       -              general conditions in the markets in which we operate;       and       -              economic and financial conditions.. The put right we have agreed to grant to the IFC Investors on the occurrence of certain triggering events may have adverse impacts on us.. In May 2016, we issued an aggregate of 9,984,311 shares of our common stock to the IFC Investors. We granted the IFC Investors certain rights, including the right to require us to repurchase any shares we have sold to the IFC Investors upon the occurrence of specified triggering events, which we refer to as a \"put right.\" Events triggering the put right relate to (1) us being the subject of a governmental complaint alleging, a court judgment finding or an indictment alleging that we (a) engaged in specified corrupt, fraudulent, coercive, collusive or obstructive practices; (b) entered into transactions with targets of economic sanctions; or (c) failed to operate our business in compliance with anti-money laundering or anti-terrorism laws; or (2) we reject a bona fide offer to acquire all of our outstanding shares at a time when we have in place or implement a shareholder rights plan, or adopt a shareholder rights plan triggered by a beneficial ownership threshold of less than twenty percent. The put price per share will be the higher of the price per share paid to us by the IFC Investors and the volume-weighted average price per share prevailing for the 60 trading days preceding the triggering event, except that with respect to a put right triggered by rejection of a bona fide offer, the put price per share will be the highest price offered by the offeror. If a put triggering event occurs, it could adversely impact our liquidity and capital resources. In addition, the existence of the put right could also affect whether or on what terms a third party might in the future offer to purchase our company. Our response to any such offer could also be complicated, delayed or otherwise influenced by the existence of the put right.. Approximately 38% of our outstanding common stock is owned by three shareholders. The interests of these shareholders may conflict with those of our other shareholders.. There is a concentration of ownership of our outstanding common stock because approximately 38% of our outstanding common stock is owned by three shareholders. Based on their most recent SEC filings disclosing ownership of our shares, IFC Investors, International Value Advisers, LLC, or IVA, and Allan Gray Proprietary Limited, beneficially owned approximately 18%, 15% and 5% of our outstanding common stock, respectively.. The interests of the IFC Investors, IVA and Allan Gray, may be different from or conflict with the interests of our other shareholders. As a result of the ownership by the IFC Investors, IVA and Allan Gray, they will be able, if they act together, to significantly influence our management and affairs and all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company, thus depriving shareholders of a premium for their shares, or facilitating a change of control that other shareholders may oppose.. We may seek to raise additional financing by issuing new securities with terms or rights superior to those of our shares of common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock.. We may require additional financing to fund future operations, including expansion in current and new markets, programming development and acquisition, capital costs and the costs of any necessary implementation of technological innovations or alternative technologies, or to fund acquisitions. Because of the exposure to market risks associated with economies in emerging markets, we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all.. 28. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the percentage ownership of our current shareholders will be reduced, and the holders of the new equity securities may have rights superior to those of the holders of shares of common stock, which could adversely affect the market price and voting power of shares of common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, the holders of these debt securities would similarly have some rights senior to those of the holders of shares of common stock, and the terms of these debt securities could impose restrictions on operations and create a significant interest expense for us.. We may have difficulty raising necessary capital to fund operations or acquisitions as a result of market price volatility for our shares of common stock.. In recent years, the securities markets in the United States have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility, and the market price of securities of many companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to the operations, performance, underlying asset values or prospects of such companies. For these reasons, our shares of common stock can also be expected to be subject to volatility resulting from purely market forces over which we will have no control. If our business development plans are successful, we may require additional financing to continue to develop and exploit existing and new technologies, to expand into new markets and to make acquisitions, all of which may be dependent upon our ability to obtain financing through debt and equity or other means.. Issuances of significant amounts of stock in the future could potentially dilute your equity ownership and adversely affect the price of our common stock.. We believe that it is necessary to maintain a sufficient number of available authorized shares of our common stock in order to provide us with the flexibility to issue shares for business purposes that may arise from time to time. For example, we could sell additional shares to raise capital to fund our operations or to acquire other businesses, issue shares in a BEE transaction, issue additional shares under our stock incentive plan or declare a stock dividend. Our board may authorize the issuance of additional shares of common stock without notice to, or further action by, our shareholders, unless shareholder approval is required by law or the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market. The issuance of additional shares could dilute the equity ownership of our current shareholders. In addition, additional shares that we issue would likely be freely tradable which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.. Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, especially over companies that we may acquire, could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes, we are required to furnish a management certification and auditor attestation regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We are required to report, among other things, control deficiencies that constitute a material weakness or changes in internal control that materially affect, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.. The requirement to evaluate and report on our internal controls over financial reporting also applies to companies that we acquire. As a private company, DNI was not required to comply with the requirements of Sarbanes prior to the time we acquired it. As DNI was acquired on June 30, 2018, there was not sufficient time, and therefore it was not possible for management to perform as assessment of the internal controls at DNI. Our management evaluation and auditor attestation regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018, excluded the operations of DNI. If we fail to successfully integrate the operations of these acquired companies into our internal control over financial reporting, our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective. The integration of DNI into our internal control over financial reporting requires significant time and resources from our management and other personnel and may increase our compliance costs.. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in our internal control related to our recognition of revenue from our SASSA contract during the three months ended June 30, 2018. As discussed in Item 3Legal ProceedingsConstitutional Court order regarding extension of contract with SASSA for 12 months, our SASSA contract was extended by, and is currently subject to the ongoing oversight of, the Constitutional Court. Specifically, they concluded that our procedures and controls did not appropriately assess the documentation specific to the provision of cash payment services during the three months ended June 30, 2018, which should have resulted in the Company concluding that there is no evidence of an arrangement at a fixed and determinable price other than that noted in the court order extension. This material weakness could have resulted in a material misstatement of our financial statements that would not have been prevented or detected. In the event that we are faced with a similar set of circumstances in the future, we intend to appoint an independent expert to assist us in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to our material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting or that they will prevent potential future material weaknesses.. 29. While we continue to dedicate resources and management time to ensuring that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on the markets perception of our business and our stock price.. You may experience   difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments   or bringing original actions based upon U.S. laws, including the federal   securities laws or other foreign laws, against us or certain of our directors   and officers and experts.. While Net1 is incorporated in the state of Florida, United States, the company is headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa and substantially all of the company's assets are located outside the United States. In addition, the majority of Net1's directors and all its officers reside outside of the United States and the majority of our experts, including our independent registered public accountants, are based in South Africa.. As a result, even though you could effect service of legal process upon Net1, as a Florida corporation, in the United States, you may not be able to collect any judgment obtained against Net1 in the United States, including any judgment based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, because substantially all of our assets are located outside the United States. Moreover, it may not be possible for you to effect service of legal process upon the majority of our directors and officers or upon our experts within the United States or elsewhere outside South Africa and any judgment obtained against any of our foreign directors, officers and experts in the United States, including one based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States and may not be enforced by a South African court.. South Africa is not a party to any treaties regarding the enforcement of foreign commercial judgments, as opposed to foreign arbitral awards. Accordingly, a foreign judgment is not directly enforceable in South Africa, but constitutes a cause of action which may be enforced by South African courts provided that:. <U+0095>              the court which pronounced the judgment had international       jurisdiction and competence to entertain the case according to the       principles recognized by South African law with reference to the       jurisdiction of foreign courts;       <U+0095>              the judgment is final and conclusive (that is, it cannot       be altered by the court which pronounced it);       <U+0095>              the judgment has not lapsed;       <U+0095>              the recognition and enforcement of the judgment by South       African courts would not be contrary to public policy in South Africa,       including observance of the rules of natural justice which require that no       award is enforceable unless the defendant was duly served with documents       initiating proceedings, that he was given a fair opportunity to be heard       and that he enjoyed the right to be legally represented in a free and fair       trial before an impartial tribunal;       <U+0095>              the judgment was not obtained by improper or fraudulent       means;       <U+0095>              the judgment does not involve the enforcement of a penal       or foreign revenue law or any award of multiple or punitive damages; and             <U+0095>              the enforcement of the judgment is not otherwise       precluded by the provisions of the Protection of Business Act 99 of 1978       (as amended), of the Republic of South Africa.. It has been the policy of South African courts to award compensation for the loss or damage actually sustained by the person to whom the compensation is awarded. South African courts have awarded compensation to shareholders who have suffered damages as a result of a diminution in the value of their shares based on various actions by the corporation and its management. Although the award of punitive damages is generally unknown to the South African legal system, that does not mean that such awards are necessarily contrary to public policy.. Whether a judgment was contrary to public policy depends on the facts of each case. Exorbitant, unconscionable, or excessive awards will generally be contrary to public policy. South African courts cannot enter into the merits of a foreign judgment and cannot act as a court of appeal or review over the foreign court. Further, if a foreign judgment is enforced by a South African court, it will be payable in South African currency. Also, under South Africa's exchange control laws, the approval of SARB is required before a defendant resident in South Africa may pay money to a non-resident plaintiff in satisfaction of a foreign judgment enforced by a court in South Africa.. It is doubtful whether an original action based on United States federal securities laws may be brought before South African courts. A plaintiff who is not resident in South Africa may be required to provide security for costs in the event of proceedings being initiated in South Africa. Furthermore, the Rules of the High Court of South Africa require that documents executed outside South Africa must be authenticated for the purpose of use in South African courts.. In reaching the foregoing conclusions in respect of South Africa, we consulted with our South African legal counsel, Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr Inc.. 30"
