[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Our business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and could cause the value of our common stock to decline.. Readers should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting us. However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our capital stock and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INVESTMENTS. Our growth depends on external sources of capital that are outside of our control and may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could limit our ability to, among other things, meet our capital and operating needs or make the cash distributions to our stockholders necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT.. <U+FEFF>. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required under the Code to, among other things, distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain. In addition, we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, including any net capital gains. Because of these distribution requirements, we are not able to retain significant earnings to fund future capital needs, including our investments in self-storage facilities, and must rely largely on third-party sources to fund our capital needs. In addition, we have not yet generated sufficient cash flow from operations or investment activities to enable us to cover our distributions to our stockholders. As a result, we are dependent on our Credit Facility, our ability to issue shares of our Series A Preferred Stock and other access to third-party sources of capital to continue our investing activities and pay distributions to our stockholders. Our access to third-party sources depends, in part, on:. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tgeneral market conditions;. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tthe market's perception of our financial strength and growth potential;. <U+FEFF>. u \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tour debt levels;. <U+FEFF>. u \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tour earnings and expected earnings;. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tour cash flows and cash distributions; and. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tthe market price per share of our common stock.. <U+FEFF>. If we are unable to obtain capital from third-party sources, we may not be able to fund the obligations in our portfolio or make the cash distributions to our stockholders at current levels, as required by our preferred stock or necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT.. Because we are focused on the self-storage industry, our revenues will be significantly influenced by supply and demand dynamics in the self-storage sector generally, and over-building in particular markets and/or a decrease in demand for self-storage units would likely have a greater adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations than if we owned a more diversified investment portfolio.. While we intend to diversify our portfolio of investments within the self-storage market, we are not required to observe specific diversification criteria. Our investment portfolio consists primarily of loans on self-storage facilities, which subject us to risks inherent in investments for a single industry. An over-supply of or decrease in the demand for self-storage units would likely have a greater adverse effect on our revenues than if we owned a more diversified investment portfolio. Over-supply can occur when developers over-build the self-storage needs of a particular market or sub-market. Demand for self-storage units has been and could be adversely affected by weakness in the national, regional and local economies and changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing self-storage facilities in an area. To the extent that any of these conditions occur, they are likely to have a negative impact on the value of our investments, which could cause a decrease in our revenue. Any such decrease could impair our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. We do not expect to invest in other real estate or businesses to hedge against the risk that industry trends might decrease the profitability of our self-storage-related investments.. 20. <U+FEFF>. Substantially all of our portfolio investments are recorded at fair value and, as a result, there will be uncertainty as to the value of these investments.. Substantially all of our portfolio investments are, and will continue to be, in the form of loans and positions or securities that are recorded at fair value and are not publicly traded. Personnel employed by our Manager will perform valuations of our investments in consultation with professionals who provide advice as to methodology and data validity. That said, such personnel employed by our Manager are not valuation experts. The fair value of securities and other investments that are not publicly traded may be difficult to determine and may involve substantial judgment on the part of our Manager. We will value these investments quarterly at fair value, which likely will include use of and reliance on inputs that do not involve market quotations or other objective, transparent or observable characteristics. Because such valuations are subjective, the fair value of certain of our assets may fluctuate over short periods of time and our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed. Factors which might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement include changes in market yields, discount rates, our borrowers' earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), exit date, prevailing cap rates for self-storage properties, volatility, market conditions, and other events. Our results of operations and the value of our common stock could be adversely affected if the fair value of our investments significantly decreases from period to period or if our determinations regarding the fair value of these investments were materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon their disposal. The valuation process can be particularly challenging during periods of economic turmoil, such as were experienced during the last financial crisis, making valuations during such times more unpredictable and volatile.. <U+FEFF>. If our Manager overestimates the yields or incorrectly prices the risks of our investments, we may experience losses.. Our Manager values our potential investments based on yields and risks, taking into account estimated future losses on the mortgage loans and the collateral underlying them and the estimated impact of these losses on expected future cash flows and returns. Our Manager's loss estimates may not prove accurate, as actual results may vary from estimates. If our Manager underestimates the asset-level losses relative to the price we pay for a particular investment, we may experience losses with respect to such investment.. <U+FEFF>. Interest rate fluctuations could increase our financing costs and reduce our ability to generate income on our investments, each of which could lead to a significant decrease in our results of operations, cash flows and the market value of our investments.. Our primary interest rate exposures relate to the interest rates and other yield on our investments and the financing cost of our debt, as well as our exposure to interest rate swaps that we may utilize for hedging purposes either with respect to our assets or our indebtedness. Changes in interest rates will affect our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning investments and the interest expense we incur in financing these investments. Interest rate fluctuations resulting in our interest expense exceeding interest income would result in reduced net interest income and, possibly, operating losses for us. Changes in the level of interest rates also may affect our ability to originate and close debt investments, the value of our investments and our ability to realize gains from the disposition of assets. Changes in interest rates may also affect borrower default rates.. As of December 31, 2017, we had $732,000 of floating-rate indebtedness, none of which was outstanding under the Credit Facility. Further, all future borrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to floating rates. To the extent that our financing costs are determined by reference to floating rates, such as LIBOR or a Treasury index, plus a margin, the amount of such costs will depend on a variety of factors, including, without limitation, (a) for collateralized debt, the value and liquidity of the collateral, and for non-collateralized debt, our credit, (b) the level and movement of interest rates, and (c) general market conditions and liquidity. In a period of rising interest rates, our interest expense on floating rate debt would increase, while any additional interest income we earn on our floating rate investments may not compensate for such increase in interest expense. At the same time, the interest income we earn on our fixed rate investments would not change and the market value of our fixed rate investments would decrease. Similarly, in a period of declining interest rates, our interest income on floating rate investments would decrease, while any decrease in the interest we are charged on our floating rate debt may not compensate for such decrease in interest income and interest we are charged on our fixed rate debt would not change. Any such scenario could materially and adversely affect us.. Our operating results will depend, in part, on differences between the income earned on our investments and our financing costs. For any period during which our investments are not match-funded, the income earned on such investments may respond more slowly to interest rate fluctuations than the cost of our borrowings. Consequently, changes in interest rates, particularly short-term interest rates, may immediately and significantly decrease our results of operations and cash flows and the market value of our investments.. <U+FEFF>. The Credit Facility restricts our ability to engage in certain business activities, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness and make certain investments.. The Credit Facility contains customary negative covenants and other financial and operating covenants that, among other things:. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\trestrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness;. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\trestrict our ability to incur additional liens;. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   \t\t  \t\t\t21  \t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t   \t\t     \t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\trestrict our ability to make certain investments;. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\trestrict our ability to merge with another company;. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\trestrict our ability to make distributions to our stockholders above our existing dividend per share, subject to other limitations; and. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\trequire us to satisfy minimum financial coverage ratios, minimum tangible net worth requirements, maximum leverage ratios and minimum liquidity ratios.. <U+FEFF>. These limitations restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution and our ability to service our debt obligations.. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our development investments.. Further, the Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our development investments that have achieved a certificate of occupancy. If we are unable to repay or refinance the Credit Facility upon maturity or otherwise have an event of default under the Credit Facility, then the assets securing the Credit Facility could be foreclosed upon, or we might be forced to dispose of some of our assets on disadvantageous terms, with a consequent loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure or disadvantageous disposal on one or more of our assets could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay distributions on, and the market price of, our common stock.. <U+FEFF>. We may be unable to make distributions at historical levels, which could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock.. We intend to continue to pay regular quarterly distributions to our stockholders. All distributions will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based upon, among other factors, our historical and projected results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, maintenance of our REIT qualification and other tax considerations, capital expenditure and other expense obligations, debt covenants, contractual prohibitions or other limitations and applicable law and such other matters as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. In addition, we are required to pay to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, a quarterly dividend in cash and in additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock or shares of our common stock, at the election of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock. We are also required to pay quarterly cash distributions to the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock. The quarterly dividends payable to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock rank senior to the rights of our common stock with respect to distributions. If sufficient cash is not available for distribution from our operations, we may have to fund distributions from working capital, borrow to provide funds for such distributions, or reduce the amount of such distributions. To the extent we borrow to fund distributions, our future interest costs would increase, thereby reducing our earnings and cash available for distribution from what they otherwise would have been. If cash available for distribution generated by our assets is less than our current estimate, or if such cash available for distribution decreases in future periods from expected levels, our inability to make the expected distributions could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock.. As a result of the foregoing, we may not be able to make distributions in the future, and our inability to make distributions, or to make distributions at expected levels, could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock.. <U+FEFF>. We operate in a competitive market for investment opportunities and competition may limit our ability to originate or acquire desirable investments in our target investments and could also affect the pricing of these securities.. A number of entities compete with us to make the types of investments that we seek to make. Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to originate or acquire our target investments on attractive terms. In originating or acquiring our target investments, we compete with a variety of institutional investors, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial finance and insurance companies and other financial institutions. Several other REITs have raised, or are expected to raise, significant amounts of capital, and may have investment objectives that overlap with ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities. Many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have considerably greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. Some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us, such as the U.S. Government. Many of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT tax compliance or maintenance of an exemption from the 1940 Act. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments, deploy more aggressive pricing and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, competition for originations of and investments in our target investments may lead to the price of such assets increasing, which may further limit our ability to generate desired returns. We cannot assure that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, as a result of this competition, desirable investments in our target investments may be limited in the future and we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, as we can provide no assurance that we will be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objectives.. 22. <U+FEFF>. We face risks associated with property acquisitions.. In connection with our development property investments and bridge loans, we have typically received ROFRs to acquire the self-storage facilities underlying our investments. In addition, from time-to-time, our developer partners offer to sell us their interests in projects we finance, providing us the opportunity to be the sole owner of such projects. Subject to acquisition prices being consistent with our investment objective to create long-term value for our stockholders, we intend to acquire a significant number of the self-storage facilities that we have financed either through the exercise of ROFRs or through privately negotiated transactions with our developer partners.. <U+FEFF>. Those acquisitions that we consummate would increase our size and may potentially alter our capital structure. Although we believe that future acquisitions that we complete will enhance our financial performance, the success of acquisitions is subject to the risks that acquired properties may fail to perform as expected or we may not be able to acquire properties we wish to because we are unable to obtain financing on attractive terms, or at all. The failure to make such acquisitions or the failure of acquisitions to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders.. <U+FEFF>. The JV Agreement contains a \"put\" provision with respect to certain development property investments, the exercise of which could require us to expend significant capital to reacquire development property investments at a time when such capital might not be readily available, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.. The JV Agreement contains a provision that permits Heitman to cause us to repurchase from Heitman its share of its interests in the developer entities (the \"Developer Equity Interests\"). Under the JV Agreement, if a developer causes to be refinanced a self-storage facility with respect to which we have made a development property investment and such refinancing does not coincide with a sale of the underlying self-storage facility, then at any time after the fourth anniversary of the commencement of the SL1 Venture, Heitman may either put to us its share of the Developer Equity Interests in respect of each such development property investment, or sell Heitman's Developer Equity Interests to a third party. The exercise by Heitman of its put right with respect to any development property investment at a time when we lack capital could result in our being in default under the JV Agreement, in which event we could lose some or all of our economic benefit from the SL1 Venture, including, but not limited to, being removed as the managing member of the SL1 Venture. Moreover, if we are required to use our capital to pay the price of any put by Heitman, we may be unable to fund other commitments or add investments in the future, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.. Heitman has certain rights of first offer/refusal on follow-on joint ventures and other similar financings during the pendency of the SL1 Venture, which could materially adversely affect our ability to source other equity capital on a competitive basis.. Under the JV Agreement, during the pendency of the SL1 Venture, and as long as the SL1 Venture holds any assets, Heitman has the right of first offer to participate in any joint venture or similar program pursued by us on substantially the same terms as those set forth in the JV Agreement. This right of first offer is extensive, and includes any investment of debt or equity or otherwise, directly or indirectly, in one or more new joint ventures or similar programs for the purposes of funding or providing development loans or financing, directly or indirectly, for the development, construction or conversion of self-storage facilities. Heitman's possession of such rights could materially adversely affect our ability to obtain joint venture terms from another prospective joint venture partner that could be more favorable to us than the terms of the SL1 Venture and have a corresponding adverse impact on our business.. <U+FEFF>. The SL1 Venture is subject to certain provisions triggered by a change in control of the Company that would permit Heitman to serve as managing member of the SL1 Venture instead of us or, in the alternative, cause a sale of the SL1 Venture's assets, which could result in the Developer Equity Interests held by the SL1 Venture being liquidated at a time prior to their achieving their full value or Heitman obtaining control of the assets of the SL1 Venture, which could materially adversely affect the relationship between the SL1 Venture and developers/borrowers to the material detriment of maximizing the value of the assets of the SL1 Venture.. The JV Agreement provides that if we experience a change in control, which is defined as (i) the sale of all or substantially all of our assets (excluding the assets of the SL1 Venture), (ii) any merger, reorganization, share exchange, recapitalization, restructuring, or consolidation or similar transaction, which would result in a change in ownership of more than a majority of our outstanding common stock,(iii) the acquisition by any person of an aggregate of a majority of the beneficial ownership of our common stock unless current directors or directors who are selected, nominated or approved by our current directors or future approved directors continue to comprise a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company following such acquisition, (iv) the replacement of a majority of our current directors or directors who are selected, nominated or approved by our current directors or future approved directors, (v) the de-registration of our common stock, or (vi) our bankruptcy or insolvency, then Heitman may either remove and replace us as managing member of the SL1 Venture or cause the SL1 Venture to sell all of its assets. If we are removed as managing member of the SL1 Venture, then the relationship between the SL1 Venture and the developer/borrowers under the development property investments held by the SL1 Venture could be adversely affected, prompting such developer/borrowers to prematurely sell assets at less than optimal value. Further, if we are removed as the managing member upon an event of default (as defined in the JV Agreement) or a change in control, we will lose any reimbursement or fees earned during or attributable to the period prior to our removal and we only will be entitled to promote distributions, if any, based on the fair market value of the assets as of the date of our removal. The sale of assets of the SL1 Venture at a time prior to the Developer Equity Interests underlying the development property investments fully maturing could have a material adverse effect on us.. 23. Under the JV Agreement, Heitman has the right to approve all \"Major Decisions\" of the SL1 Venture, which may materially impact our ability to control our development property investments and operate our business.. Under the JV Agreement, Heitman has the right to approve all \"Major Decisions\" of the SL1 Venture. These \"Major Decisions\" include, but are not limited to, the incurrence of any indebtedness by the SL1 Venture, the sale or disposition of assets of the SL1 Venture, the replacement of the managing member, the acceptance of new members into the SL1 Venture and the liquidation of the SL1 Venture. This right to approve all Major Decisions may impact our ability to acquire or dispose of the assets in the SL1 Venture, make other critical investment decisions to maximize the value of the assets in the Heitman Joint Activity, or close on other attractive investment opportunities. To the extent such approvals or consents are required, we may experience difficulty in, or may be prevented from, implementing our plans and strategies with respect to expansion, development, property management, on-going operations, financing, or other aspects of our business.. <U+FEFF>. The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.. The illiquidity of our target investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need or desire arises. A majority of our investments involve loans to finance new construction, which are particularly illiquid due to their potential unsuitability for securitization, the lack of current income from the underlying property and the greater difficulty of recovery in the event of a borrower's default. In addition, most of the loans in which we invest will not be registered under the relevant securities laws, resulting in a prohibition against their transfer, sale, pledge or their disposition except in a transaction that is exempt from the registration requirements of, or otherwise in accordance with, those laws. Further, investments in real estate are generally illiquid and cannot be sold quickly. In particular, the tax laws applicable to REITs also generally require that we hold real estate for investment. As a result, we expect most of our investments will be illiquid, and if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our investments. As a result, our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be relatively limited, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.. Hedging against interest rate exposure may adversely affect our earnings, which could reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders.. Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, we may pursue various hedging strategies to reduce our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates. Our hedging activity will vary in scope based on the level and volatility of interest rates, the type of assets held and debt incurred and other changing market conditions. Interest rate hedging may fail to protect or could adversely affect us because, among other things:. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tinterest rate hedging can be expensive, particularly during periods of rising and volatile interest rates;. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tavailable interest rate hedges may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought;. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tdue to a credit loss, the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability;. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tthe amount of income that a REIT may earn from hedging transactions (other than hedging transactions that satisfy certain requirements of the Code or that are done through a taxable REIT subsidiary, or \"TRS\") to offset interest rate losses is limited by U.S. federal income tax provisions governing REITs;. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tthe credit quality of the hedging counterparty owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction; and. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tthe hedging counterparty owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay. In addition, we may fail to recalculate, readjust and execute hedges in an efficient manner.. <U+FEFF>. Any hedging activity in which we engage may materially and adversely affect our business. Therefore, while we may enter into such transactions seeking to reduce interest rate risks, unanticipated changes in interest rates may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions or liabilities being hedged may vary materially. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio positions or liabilities being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss.. 24. Hedging instruments often are not traded on regulated exchanges or guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house, and involve risks and costs that could result in material losses.. The cost of using hedging instruments increases as the period covered by the instrument increases and during periods of rising and volatile interest rates; we may increase our hedging activity and thus increase our hedging costs during periods when interest rates are volatile or rising and hedging costs have increased. In addition, hedging instruments involve risk since they often are not traded on regulated exchanges or guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house. Consequently, there are no requirements with respect to record keeping, financial responsibility or segregation of customer funds and positions. Furthermore, the enforceability of agreements underlying hedging transactions may depend on compliance with applicable statutory and commodity and other regulatory requirements and, depending on the identity of the counterparty, applicable international requirements. The business failure of a hedging counterparty with whom we enter into a hedging transaction will most likely result in its default. Default by a party with whom we enter into a hedging transaction may result in the loss of unrealized profits and force us to cover our commitments, if any, at the then current market price. Although generally we will seek to reserve the right to terminate our hedging positions, it may not always be possible to dispose of or close out a hedging position without the consent of the hedging counterparty and we may not be able to enter into an offsetting contract in order to cover our risk. We cannot assure you that a liquid secondary market will exist for hedging instruments purchased or sold, and we may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration, which could result in significant losses.. Changes to derivatives regulation imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act could increase our costs of entering into derivative transactions, which could adversely impact our results of operation, financial condition and business.. Through its comprehensive new regulatory regime for derivatives, the Dodd-Frank Act will impose mandatory clearing, exchange-trading and margin requirements on many derivatives transactions (including formerly unregulated over the-counter derivatives) in which we may engage. The Dodd-Frank Act also creates new categories of regulated market participants, such as \"swap dealers,\" \"security-based swap dealers,\" \"major swap participants,\" and \"major security-based swap participants\" that will be subject to significant new capital, registration, recordkeeping, reporting, disclosure, business conduct and other regulatory requirements. The details of these requirements and the parameters of these categories remain to be clarified through rulemaking and interpretations by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the SEC, the Federal Reserve Board and other regulators in a comprehensive regulatory implementation process that is currently underway.. Nonetheless, based on information available, the possible effect of the Dodd-Frank Act will be likely to increase our overall costs of entering into derivatives transactions. In particular, new margin requirements, position limits and capital charges, even if not directly applicable to us, may cause an increase in the pricing of derivatives transactions sold by market participants to whom such requirements apply. Administrative costs, due to new requirements such as registration, recordkeeping, reporting, and compliance, even if not directly applicable to us, may also be reflected in higher pricing of derivatives. New exchange-trading and trade reporting requirements may lead to reductions in the liquidity of derivative transactions, causing higher pricing or reduced availability of derivatives, or the reduction of arbitrage opportunities for us, adversely affecting the performance of certain of our trading strategies.. In addition, it is possible that we may be determined by a governmental authority to be a swap dealer, major swap participant, security-based swap dealer, major security-based swap participant or otherwise become subject to new entity level regulation as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act. This additional regulation could lead to significant new costs which could materially adversely affect our business.. A prolonged economic slowdown, a lengthy or severe recession or further declines in real estate values could impair our growth and harm our operations.. We believe the risks associated with our business will be more severe during periods of economic slowdown or recession if these periods are accompanied by declining real estate values. Declining real estate values would likely reduce the level of new mortgage and other real estate-related loan originations since borrowers often use appreciation in the value of their existing facilities to support the purchase or investment in additional facilities. Borrowers may also be less able to pay principal and interest on our loans if the value of real estate weakens. Further, declining real estate values significantly increase the likelihood that we will incur losses on or material decreases in the fair value of our investments. Any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could adversely affect our Manager's ability to invest in or sell loans, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and business and our ability to pay dividends to stockholders.. Our real estate investments are subject to risks particular to real property. These risks may result in a reduction or elimination of, or return from, a loan secured by a particular facility.. We own and in the future may own more commercial real estate directly as a result of a default of mortgage or other real estate-related loans or the acquisition of real estate assets from our development borrowers or otherwise.

If any of these or similar events occurs, it may reduce our return from an affected facility or investment and reduce or eliminate our ability to pay dividends to stockholders.. Investments in non-conforming and non-investment grade rated loans or securities involve increased risk of loss.. A substantial majority of our investments do not conform to conventional loan standards applied by traditional lenders. Virtually all of our investments are not rated, and, if they were rated, would be rated as non-investment grade by the rating agencies. The non-investment grade ratings for these assets typically result from the overall leverage of the loans, the lack of a strong operating history for the facilities underlying the loans, the borrowers' credit history, the underlying facilities' cash flow or other factors. As a result, these investments should be expected to have a higher risk of default and loss than investment grade rated assets. Any loss we incur may be significant and may reduce distributions to our stockholders and adversely affect the market value of our common stock. There are no limits on the percentage of unrated or non-investment grade rated assets we may hold in our investment portfolio.. Our mezzanine loan assets will involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by income-producing facilities.. We may originate or acquire mezzanine loans, which take the form of loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the facility or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the facility. These types of assets involve a higher degree of risk than long-term senior mortgage lending secured by income-producing real property, because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender. In the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security, we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan. If a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt. As a result, we may not recover some or all of our initial expenditure. In addition, mezzanine loans may have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the facility and increasing the risk of loss of principal. Significant losses related to our mezzanine loans would result in operating losses for us and may limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.. For assets recorded at cost, we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets.. A decline in the fair market value of any investment that is recorded and carried at \"cost\" may require us to recognize an \"other-than-temporary\" impairment against such assets under GAAP if we were to determine that, with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the original acquisition cost of such assets. If such a determination were to be made, we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale. If we experience a decline in the fair value of our assets, our results of operations, financial condition and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be materially and adversely affected.. Insurance on mortgage loans and real estate securities collateral may not cover all losses.. There are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, terrorism or acts of war, which may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors, including terrorism or acts of war, also might result in insurance proceeds insufficient to repair or replace a facility if it is damaged or destroyed. Under these circumstances, the insurance proceeds received with respect to a facility relating to one of our investments might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to our investment. Any uninsured loss could result in the loss of cash flow from, and the asset value of, the affected facility and the value of our investment related to such facility.. 26. Acquired properties may expose us to unknown liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect us.. We may acquire self-storage facilities subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities. In addition, purchase and sale agreements may contain only limited warranties, representations and indemnifications that will only survive for a limited period after the closing. Unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties may include, but are not limited to, liabilities for cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination, liabilities for failure to comply with the applicable terms and conditions of government housing assistance programs, liabilities for failure to comply with fire, health, life - safety and similar regulations, claims by residents, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties, liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties. If a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it and may lose some or all of our invested capital in the property, as well as the loss of rental income from that property, which could materially and adversely affect us.. <U+FEFF>. The revenues from our wholly-owned properties are dependent on the ability of our third-party property managers to successfully manage those properties.. <U+FEFF>. Each of our wholly-owned properties is, and we expect for the foreseeable future will be, managed by a third-party property manager. We do not control these third-party property managers, and are accordingly subject to various risks associated with outsourcing the management of day-to-day activities. Our revenues from our wholly-owned properties are dependent on the ability of the third-party property manager of each wholly-owned property to successfully manage the property. Such third-party property managers generally compete with other companies in the management of properties, including competing in, among other things, the quality of care provided, reputation, physical appearance of the property, and price and location. The inability of one of our third-party property managers to successfully compete with other companies in one or more of the foregoing areas could reduce the revenues from our wholly-owned properties, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, because we do not control our third-party property managers, the occurrence of adverse events such as issues related to insufficient internal controls, cybersecurity incidents or other adverse events may impact our revenues from our wholly-owned properties. We may be unable to anticipate such adverse events or properly assess their magnitude.. <U+FEFF>. Liabilities relating to environmental matters may impact the value of self-storage facilities that we may acquire.. While we preform customary environmental due diligence on all of our investments, and while we seek reasonable assurances from our developers about environmental issues, we may be subject to environmental liabilities arising from self-storage facilities that we acquire. Under various U.S. federal, state and local laws, an owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal of certain hazardous substances released on its property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances.. The presence of hazardous substances may adversely affect an owner's ability to sell real estate or borrow using real estate as collateral. To the extent that an owner of a property underlying one of our debt investments becomes liable for removal costs, the ability of the owner to make payments to us may be reduced, which in turn may adversely affect the value of the relevant mortgage asset held by us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.. The presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell the property that we own and we may incur substantial remediation costs, thus harming our financial condition. The discovery of material environmental liabilities attached to such properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.. <U+FEFF>. A cybersecurity incident and other technology disruptions could result in a violation of law or negatively impact our reputation and relationships with our developers or property managers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. Information and security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. We use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations, and we also use mobile devices and other online activities to connect with our employees, our developers and our third-party property managers. Such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including developers', third-party property managers', suppliers' and employees' personally identifiable information and financial and strategic information about us.. <U+FEFF>. If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with our operations, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we and our suppliers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us and our suppliers to entirely mitigate this risk. Further, in the future we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance information security measures and/or to. 27. investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. We can provide no assurances that the measures we have implemented to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents will be effective in the event of a cyber-attack.. <U+FEFF>. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third-parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, violation of privacy laws, loss of tenants, potential liability and competitive disadvantage, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on financial condition or results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. RISKS RELATED TO OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR MANAGER AND ITS AFFILIATES. Our future success depends on our Manager and its key personnel, and we may not find a suitable replacement for our Manager if our Management Agreement is terminated or if such key personnel or investment professionals leave the employment of our Manager or otherwise become unavailable to us.. We currently rely completely on our Manager to source, originate, underwrite, execute, service and manage all of our investments. Our executive officers also serve as officers of our Manager. Our Manager has significant discretion as to the implementation of our investment and operating policies and strategies. Accordingly, we believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts, experience, diligence, skill and network of business contacts of the officers and key personnel of our Manager. The officers and key personnel of our Manager evaluate, negotiate, execute and monitor our investments; therefore, our success depends on their continued service. The departure of any of the officers or key personnel of our Manager could have a material adverse effect on our business.. In addition, we can offer no assurance that our Manager will remain our investment manager or that we will continue to have access to our Manager's officers and key personnel. The initial term of our Management Agreement with our Manager only extends to April 1, 2020, with automatic one-year renewals thereafter. Our Manager may decline to renew the Management Agreement with 180 days' written notice to us. If the Management Agreement is terminated and no suitable replacement is found to manage us, we may not be able to execute our investment strategy or manage our investment portfolio.. Our future success depends, in part, upon our Manager's ability to hire and retain highly skilled managerial, investment, financial and operational personnel, and the past performance of our senior management may not be indicative of future results.. The implementation of our business plan may require that our Manager employ additional qualified personnel. Competition for highly skilled managerial, investment, financial and operational personnel is intense. We cannot assure our stockholders that our Manager will be successful in attracting and retaining such skilled personnel. If our Manager is unable to hire and retain qualified personnel as required, our growth and operating results could be adversely affected. Our stockholders should not rely upon the past performance of our senior management, as their past performance in the self-storage business or their other prior professional endeavors may not be indicative of our future results.. There are various conflicts of interest in our relationship with our Manager that could result in decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders.. In the course of our investing activities, we pay base management fees to our Manager and reimburse our Manager for all expenses it incurs except the salaries and bonuses of our Manager's chief executive officer, and chief financial officer and a portion of the salary of our president and chief operating officer, regardless of the performance of our investment portfolio. The Manager may, at its option, elect not to seek reimbursement for certain expenses during a quarterly period, which determination shall not be deemed to construe a waiver of reimbursement for similar expenses in future periods. As a result, investors in our common stock invest on a \"gross\" basis and receive distributions on a \"net\" basis after expenses, resulting in, among other things, a lower rate of return than one might achieve through direct investments. Because we pay a base management fee and reimburse expenses regardless of how our portfolio performs, our Manager's interests may be less aligned with our stockholders' interests than if we were internally managed and our management team was compensated largely based on performance.. Our code of business conduct and ethics contains a conflicts of interest policy that prohibits our directors, officers and employees from engaging in any transaction that involves an actual conflict of interest with us without the approval of the audit committee of our Board of Directors. However, we do not have a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, officers, security holders or affiliates from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. In addition, our Management Agreement with our Manager does not prevent our Manager and its affiliates from engaging in additional management or investment opportunities, some of which could compete with us, and our code of business conduct and ethics acknowledges that such activities shall not be deemed a conflict of interest.. The Management Agreement with our Manager was not negotiated on an arm's length basis and may not be as favorable to us as if it had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.. We currently do not have any employees and rely completely on our Manager to provide us with investment advisory services. Our executive officers also serve as officers of our Manager. Our Management Agreement was negotiated between related parties and its terms, including fees payable, may not be as favorable to us as if it had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party. We pay our Manager substantial base management fees regardless of the performance of our investment portfolio. Our Manager's entitlement to a base management fee, which is not based upon performance metrics or goals, might reduce its incentive to devote its time and effort to seeking investments that provide attractive. 28. risk-adjusted returns for our portfolio. This in turn could hurt both our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the market price of our common stock.. Terminating the Management Agreement for unsatisfactory performance of the Manager or electing not to renew the Management Agreement may be difficult and terminating the agreement in certain circumstances requires payment of a substantial termination fee.. <U+FEFF>. The Management Agreement may not be terminated by us during its initial five-year term except for cause. After the initial term, termination of the Management Agreement with our Manager without cause is difficult and costly. Our independent directors will review our Manager's performance and the management fees annually and, following the initial term, the Management Agreement may be terminated annually upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors based upon: (a) our Manager's unsatisfactory performance that is materially detrimental to us; or (b) a determination that the management fees payable to our Manager are not fair, subject to our Manager's right to prevent termination based on unfair fees by accepting a reduction of management fees agreed to by at least two-thirds of our independent directors. We must provide our Manager with 180 days' prior notice of any such termination. Additionally, upon such a termination, the Management Agreement provides that we will pay our Manager a termination fee equal to the greater of three times the sum of the average annual base management fee and incentive fee received by our Manager during the prior 24-month period before such termination, calculated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter, or the internalization price that would be payable pursuant to the formula set forth in our Management Agreement. This provision increases the cost to us of terminating the Management Agreement and adversely affects our ability to terminate our Manager without cause. See \"Item 1 - Relationship with our Manager\".. The incentive fee payable to our Manager under the Management Agreement may cause our Manager to select investments in more risky assets to increase its incentive compensation and the price it would receive upon internalization of our Manager.. Our Manager is entitled to receive incentive compensation based upon our achievement of targeted levels of Core Earnings. In evaluating investments and other management strategies, the opportunity to earn incentive compensation based on Core Earnings may lead our Manager to place undue emphasis on the maximization of Core Earnings at the expense of other criteria, such as preservation of capital, in order to achieve higher incentive compensation. Moreover, to the extent such higher incentive compensation increases the EBITDA of our Manager, the internalization sale price described in our Management Agreement increases by a multiple of such increased EBITDA. Investments with higher yield potential are generally riskier or more speculative, and a focus on these higher yielding investments could result in increased risk of loss of value of our investment portfolio. See \"Item 1 - Relationship with our Manager - Incentive Fees\".. <U+FEFF>. If we internalize the advisory and management services provided by our Manager, we will become exposed to new costs and risks.. <U+FEFF>. If we internalize the advisory and management services provided by our Manager, we will become exposed to new costs and risks. For example, while we would no longer bear the external costs of the management fee paid to our Manager if we become self-advised, our direct overhead may increase, as we would be responsible for compensation and benefits of our officers and other employees that were previously paid by our Manager. As a direct employer, we would also be subject to those potential liabilities that are commonly faced by employers, such as workers disability and compensation claims, potential labor disputes and other employee-related liabilities and grievances. Accordingly, if we internalize the advisory and management services provided by our Manager, our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. We may choose not to exercise our right under the Management Agreement to internalize our Manager. If we choose not to internalize or we are unable to complete an internalization transaction, our business and growth could be negatively affected and we may still be obligated to pay a termination fee upon termination of the Management Agreement.. <U+FEFF>. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, our Manager is obligated to present to us an initial proposal to internalize our Manager no later than 180 days prior to the end of the initial term of the Management Agreement. If an internalization of our Manager has not occurred prior to March 31, 2023, the last day of the last renewal term, then the Company is required to internalize the Manager to be effective as of that date and all assets of the Manager (or, alternatively, all of the equity interests in the Manager) shall be conveyed to and acquired by our Operating Company in exchange for the internalization price. Any proposal from our Manager will be the subject of definitive documentation and negotiation between us and our Manager to conclude an internalization transaction, which could adversely affect our business and growth. If we choose not to internalize our Manager and not to renew the Management Agreement or we terminate the Management Agreement at any time after the initial term other than for cause, we will be obligated to pay our Manager a termination fee equal to the greater of (A) three times the sum of the average annual base management fee and incentive fee earned by our Manager during the 24-month period prior to such termination, calculated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter prior to the date of termination, or (B) the Internalization Price. If we internalize our Manager automatically following the expiration of the last renewal term, we will pay an internalization price equal to the termination fee. In addition, if we choose not to internalize and terminate our Management Agreement, we would be required to identify and retain new management, which would be costly, disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.. <U+FEFF>. 29. Our Manager manages our portfolio in accordance with very broad investment guidelines and our Board of Directors does not approve each investment and financing decision made by our Manager, which may result in riskier investments.. While our Board of Directors periodically reviews our investment portfolio, they do not review all of our proposed investments. In addition, in conducting periodic reviews, our Board of Directors may rely primarily on information provided to them by our Manager. Our investment guidelines may be changed from time to time. Furthermore, our Manager may cause us to enter into investments utilizing complex strategies and transactions that may be difficult or impossible to unwind by the time they are reviewed by our directors. Our Manager has great latitude in determining the types of assets that are proper investments for us, which could result in investment returns that are substantially below expectations or that result in losses, which would materially and adversely affect our business operations and results. In addition, our Manager is not subject to any limits or proportions with respect to the mix of target investments that we originate or acquire other than as necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT and our exclusion from registration under the 1940 Act. Decisions made and investments entered into by our Manager may not fully reflect our stockholders' best interests.. Our Manager may change its investment process without stockholder consent, or elect not to follow it, at any time, which may adversely affect our investments.. Our Manager may change its investment process without stockholder consent at any time. In addition, there can be no assurance that our Manager will follow its investment process in relation to the identification and underwriting of prospective investments. Changes in our Manager's investment process may result in inferior due diligence and underwriting standards, which may adversely affect the performance of our investment portfolio.. <U+FEFF>. Our Manager's liability is limited under the Management Agreement, and we will indemnify our Manager against certain liabilities. As a result, we could experience poor performance or losses for which our Manager would not be liable.. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, our Manager does not assume any responsibility other than to render the services called for thereunder and is not responsible for any action of our Board of Directors in following or declining to follow its advice or recommendations. Under the terms of the Management Agreement, our Manager, its officers, members, managers, directors, personnel, any person controlling or controlled by our Manager and any person providing services to our Manager will not be liable to us, any subsidiary of ours, our stockholders or partners or any subsidiary's stockholders or partners for acts or omissions performed in accordance with and pursuant to the Management Agreement, except by reason of acts constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of their duties under the Management Agreement. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify our Manager, its officers, stockholders, members, managers, directors, personnel, any person controlling or controlled by our Manager and any person providing services to our Manager with respect to all expenses, losses, damages, liabilities, demands, charges and claims arising from acts of our Manager not constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of duties, performed in good faith in accordance with and pursuant to the Management Agreement.. <U+FEFF>. Our Manager and its affiliates have limited experience managing a portfolio of assets in the manner necessary to maintain our exclusion under the 1940 Act.. In order to maintain our exclusion from registration under the 1940 Act, the assets in our portfolio are subject to certain restrictions that meaningfully limit our operations. Our Manager has limited experience managing a portfolio in the manner necessary to maintain our exclusion from registration under the 1940 Act. A failure to maintain an exclusion from registration under the 1940 Act could have a material adverse effect on our business.. RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.. The capital and credit markets have recently experienced a period of extreme volatility and disruption. The market price and liquidity of the market for shares of our common stock may be significantly affected by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance.. <U+FEFF>.

As noted above, market factors unrelated to our performance could also negatively impact the market price of our common stock. One of the factors that investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell our common stock is our distribution rate as a percentage of our stock price relative to market interest rates. If market interest rates increase, prospective investors may demand a higher distribution rate or seek alternative investments paying higher dividends or interest. As a result, interest rate fluctuations and conditions in the capital markets can affect the market value of our common stock. For instance, if interest rates rise, it is likely that the market price of our common stock will decrease as market rates on interest-bearing securities increase.. Common stock eligible for future sale may have adverse effects on our share price.. We cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of our common stock, or the availability of shares for future sales, on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock or the perception that such sales could occur may adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock. We may issue additional shares in subsequent public offerings or private placements to make new investments or for other purposes. We are not required to offer any such shares to existing stockholders on a preemptive basis. Therefore, it may not be possible for existing stockholders to participate in such future share issuances, which may dilute the existing stockholders' interests in us.. We have been and may continue to be unable to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations to make distributions to our stockholders at any time in the future.. We are generally required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital. 31. gains, for us to qualify as a REIT, which requirement we currently intend to satisfy through quarterly distributions of all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income in such year, subject to certain adjustments. Our ability to pay distributions may be adversely affected by a number of factors. All distributions will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, our financial condition, debt covenants, maintenance of our REIT qualification and other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. We believe that a change in any one of the following factors could adversely affect our results of operations and impair our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders:. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tour ability to make profitable investments;. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tmargin calls or other expenses that reduce our cash flow;. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tdefaults in our asset portfolio or decreases in the value of our portfolio; and. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tthe fact that anticipated operating expense levels may not prove accurate, as actual results may vary from estimates.. <U+FEFF>. As a result, no assurance can be given that we will be able to make distributions to our stockholders at any time in the future or that the level of any distributions we do make to our stockholders will achieve a market yield or increase or even be maintained over time, any of which could materially and adversely affect us.. In addition, distributions that we make to our stockholders out of current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and not designated by us as capital gain dividends generally will be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary income. However, a portion of our distributions may be designated by us as capital gain dividends and generally will be taxed to our stockholders as long-term capital gain to the extent that such distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year, without regard to the period for which the stockholder that receives such distribution has held its stock. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and not designated by us as capital gain dividends will constitute a return of capital. A return of capital is not taxable, but has the effect of reducing the basis of a stockholder's investment in our common stock, but not below zero. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits that exceed a stockholder's basis are included in such stockholder's income as capital gain.. We have issued and will continue to issue shares of our Series A Preferred Stock that ranks senior to our common stock in priority of dividend payment and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and has additional corporate governance rights, materially adversely affect our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock and the trading price of our common stock.. As of December 31, 2017, we had 40,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding with an aggregate liquidation preference of $40.0 million, with the ability to issue up to an aggregate of $125.0 million of Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, in February 2018, we issued an additional 20,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to a quarterly distribution payable in cash and in either additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock or shares of our common stock, at the holders' election, as well as a cash premium upon the occurrence of certain triggering events. The Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock with respect to priority of such dividend payments, as well as to rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. As a result, distributions on the Series A Preferred Stock may limit our ability to make distributions to holders of our common stock. Further, upon our liquidation, holders of our Series A Preferred Stock will receive a distribution of our available assets before common stockholders in an amount equal to the greater of $1,000 per share, plus all accumulated but unpaid dividends thereon to, but not including, the date of any liquidation or the amount that would be paid on such date in the event of a redemption following a change of control. Holders of shares of our common stock bear the risk that our future issuances of equity securities, including additional shares of our Series A Preferred Stock and/or shares of our common stock as quarterly dividend payments to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, will dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock, and may negatively affect our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.. In addition, so long as any shares of our Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting as a single class, are entitled to nominate and elect one individual to serve on our Board of Directors. Further, if we are unable to pay the full amount of the Series A Preferred Stock quarterly dividends for six or more quarterly dividend periods, whether or not consecutive dividend periods, we are required to increase the size of our Board of Directors by two members, and the holders of the our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to elect two additional directors to serve on our Board of Directors until we pay the full amount of accumulated and unpaid dividends. Moreover, if at any time that the Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding, Dean Jernigan, our current Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, voluntarily leaves the position of Chief Executive Officer, and is not serving as the Executive Chairman of the Board, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will have the right to accept or reject the service of any person as Chief Executive Officer (or such person serving as the principal executive officer) of the Company. Such additional governance rights may grant the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock additional control rights, which may impact our ability to run our business, and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.. 32. Mandatory redemption of our Series A Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of certain future events may require us to make substantial payments to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, which may limit our ability to pay distributions to the holders of our common stock in the future.. Until July 27, 2019, upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, the holders of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock have the option to cause us to redeem their shares at a redemption price of $1,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, plus a make-whole premium designed to provide the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock with a return on the redeemed shares equal to a 14.0% internal rate of return through July 27, 2019.. The redemption of our Series A Preferred Stock may require us to make substantial payments to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, which would limit our ability to pay distributions to the holders of our common stock and may affect materially our ability to fund our investment portfolio.. <U+FEFF>. The rights of our common stockholders are limited by and subordinate to the rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock and these rights may have a negative effect on the value of shares of our common stock.. <U+FEFF>. The holders of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock have rights and preferences generally senior to those of the holders of our common stock. The existence of these senior rights and preferences may have a negative effect on the value of shares of our common stock. These rights are more fully set forth in the articles supplementary governing our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, and include, but are not limited to: (i) the right to receive a liquidation preference, prior to any distribution of our assets to the holders of our common stock; and (ii) the right to convert into shares of our common stock upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the articles supplementary governing the respective series of preferred stock), which may be adjusted as set forth therein. In addition, the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock rank senior to our common stock with respect to priority of such dividend payments, which may limit our ability to make distributions to holders of our common stock.. <U+FEFF>. Mandatory redemption of our Series A Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of certain future events, including a change of control, may require us to make substantial payments to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, which may limit our ability to pay distributions to the holders of our common stock and Series B Preferred Stock in the future or to effect a special redemption at our option of the Series B Preferred Stock, even if such events constitute a change of control under the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock.. Until July 27, 2019, upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, the holders of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock have the option to cause us to redeem their shares at a redemption price of<U+2009> $1,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, plus a make-whole premium designed to provide the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock with a return on the redeemed shares equal to a 14.0% internal rate of return through July 27, 2019.. The redemption of our Series A Preferred Stock may require us to make substantial payments to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, which would limit our ability to pay distributions to holders of our common stock and Series B Preferred Stock and may materially and adversely affect our ability to fund our investment portfolio. The payment of the redemption price to holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may limit our ability to effect a special redemption at our option of the Series B Preferred Stock or adversely affect the market value of the common stock.. The change of control conversion feature of our Series B Preferred Stock and the change of control redemption feature of our Series A Preferred Stock may make it more difficult for a party to take over our company or discourage a party from taking over our company.. Upon the occurrence of a change of control as defined in the articles supplementary defining the terms of our Series B Preferred Stock, holders of our Series B Preferred Stock will have the right, subject to certain limitations, to convert some or all of their Series B Preferred Stock into our common stock (or equivalent value of alternative consideration). The Change of Control conversion features of our Series B Preferred Stock, as well as the mandatory redemption option conferred to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock upon certain events constituting a change of control under the Series A Preferred Stock, may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for our company or of delaying, deferring or preventing certain change of control transactions of our company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-current market price or that stockholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests.. Future offerings of debt or equity securities, which would rank senior to our common stock, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.. If we decide to issue debt or equity securities in the future, which would rank senior to our common stock, it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock. We and, indirectly, our stockholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our. 33. control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings in us.. <U+FEFF>. RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE. <U+FEFF>. Our Board of Directors may change our investment strategy or guidelines, financing strategy or leverage policies without stockholder consent.. Our Board of Directors may change our investment strategy or guidelines, financing strategy or leverage policies with respect to investments, originations, acquisitions, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and distributions at any time without the consent of our stockholders, which could result in an investment portfolio with a different risk profile than that of our existing investment portfolio or of a portfolio comprised of our target investments. A change in our investment strategy may increase our exposure to interest rate risk, default risk and real estate market fluctuations. Furthermore, a change in our asset allocation could result in our making investments in asset categories different from those asset categories presently owned. These changes could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.. Changes in laws or regulations governing our operations, changes in the interpretation thereof or newly enacted laws or regulations (including, without limitation, laws and regulations having the effect of exempting mortgage REITs from the 1940 Act) and any failure by us to comply with these laws or regulations, could require changes to certain of our business practices, negatively impact our operations, cash flow or financial condition, impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business.. We are subject to laws and regulations at the local, state and federal levels. These laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation, may change from time to time, and new laws and regulations may be enacted. Accordingly, any change in these laws or regulations, changes in their interpretation, or newly enacted laws or regulations and any failure by us to comply with these laws or regulations, could require changes to certain of our business practices, negatively impact our operations, cash flow or financial condition, impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business. Furthermore, if regulatory capital requirements imposed on our private lenders change, they may be required to limit, or increase the cost of, financing they provide to us. In general, this could potentially increase our financing costs and reduce our liquidity or require us to sell assets at an inopportune time or price.. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\"). Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have had extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and have required extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities. While many of the rules required to be written have been promulgated, some have not yet been implemented. Although the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on us may not be known for an extended period of time, the Dodd-Frank Act, including the rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules, along with other legislative and regulatory proposals directed at the financial services industry or affecting taxation that are proposed or pending in the U.S. Congress, may negatively impact our operations, cash flows or financial condition, impose additional costs on us, intensify the regulatory supervision of us or otherwise adversely affect our business.. Over the last several years, there also has been an increase in regulatory attention to the extension of credit outside of the traditional banking sector, raising the possibility that some portion of the non-bank financial sector will be subject to new regulation. While it cannot be known at this time whether any regulation will be implemented or what form it will take, increased regulation of non-bank credit extension could negatively impact our operations, cash flows or financial condition, impose additional costs on us, intensify the regulatory supervision of us or otherwise adversely affect our business.. The Maryland General Corporation Law (the \"MGCL\") prohibits certain business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us to be acquired.. Under the MGCL, \"business combinations\" between a Maryland corporation and an \"interested stockholder\" or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities. An interested stockholder is defined as: (a) any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding voting stock of the corporation; or (b) an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding stock of the corporation.. A person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the Board of Directors approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. However, in approving a transaction, the Board of Directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the Board of Directors.. After the expiration of the five-year period described above, any business combination between the Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder must generally be recommended by the Board of Directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least:. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of the then-outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation; and. 34. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\ttwo-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation, other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected, or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder.. These supermajority vote requirements do not apply if the corporation's common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under the MGCL, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares. The MGCL also permits various exemptions from these provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by the Board of Directors before the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Pursuant to the statute, our Board of Directors has adopted a resolution exempting any business combination with our Manager or any of its affiliates. Consequently, the five-year prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to business combinations between us and our Manager or any of its affiliates. As a result, our Manager or any of its affiliates may be able to enter into business combinations with us that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders, without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and the other provisions of the statute. The business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.. Stockholders have limited control over changes in our policies and operations.. Our Board of Directors determines our major policies, including with regard to financing, growth, debt capitalization, REIT qualification and distributions. Our Board of Directors may amend or revise these and other policies without a vote of the stockholders. Under our charter and the MGCL, our stockholders generally have a right to vote only on the following matters:. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tthe election or removal of directors;. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tthe amendment of our charter, except that our Board of Directors may amend our charter without stockholder approval to:. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tchange our name;. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tchange the name or other designation or the par value of any class or series of stock and the aggregate par value of our stock;. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tincrease or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock that we have the authority to issue;. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tincrease or decrease the number of our shares of any class or series of stock that we have the authority to issue;. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\teffect certain reverse stock splits;. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tour liquidation and dissolution; and. <U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+FEFF> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t<U+F0B7> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tour being a party to a merger, consolidation, sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets or statutory share exchange. All other matters are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors.. Our authorized but unissued shares of common and preferred stock may prevent a change in our control.. Our charter authorizes us to issue up to 500 million shares of common stock and 100 million shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval. In addition, our Board of Directors may, without stockholder approval, amend our charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of our stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue and classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common or preferred stock and set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. As a result, our Board of Directors may establish a class or series of shares of common or preferred stock that could delay or prevent a merger, third-party tender offer or similar transaction or a change in incumbent management that might involve a premium price for shares of our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.. <U+FEFF>. Maintenance of our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act imposes significant limits on our operations. Your investment return may be reduced if we are required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act.. We intend to conduct our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act. We believe we will not be considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act because we will not engage, or propose to engage, primarily, or hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Further, we intend to conduct our business in a manner so that neither we, nor our Operating Company, own investment securities in excess of the 40% test set forth in Section 3(a)(1)(C) discussed herein. Because we are a holding company that will conduct its businesses primarily through wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries, this means the securities issued by these subsidiaries that are excepted from the definition of \"investment company\" under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, together with any other investment securities we may own, may not have a combined value in excess of 40% of the value of our (or our Operating Company's) total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. This requirement limits the types of businesses in which we may engage. 35. through our subsidiaries. In addition, the assets we and our subsidiaries may originate or acquire are limited by the provisions of the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated under the 1940 Act, which may adversely affect our business.. If the value of securities issued by our subsidiaries that are excepted from the definition of \"investment company\" by Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, together with any other investment securities we own, exceeds 40% of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis, or if one or more of such subsidiaries fail to maintain an exception or exemption from the 1940 Act, we could, among other things, be required either (a) to substantially change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company, (b) effect sales of our assets in a manner that, or at a time when, we would not otherwise choose to do so, or (c) to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act, any of which could negatively affect our business, the value of our common stock, the sustainability of our business model, and our ability to make distributions, which also could have an adverse effect on our business and the market price for our shares of common stock. If we or any of our subsidiaries were required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act, the registered entity would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to capital structure (including restrictions on the ability to use leverage), management, operations, prohibitions on transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the 1940 Act), portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration, and compliance with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations that would significantly change our operations. Additionally, our Manager may terminate our Management Agreement if we are required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act.. Failure to meet an exception from the definition of \"investment company\" from the 1940 Act would require us to significantly restructure our investment strategy. For example, because affiliate transactions are generally prohibited under the 1940 Act, we would not be able to enter into transactions with any of our affiliates if we are required to register as an investment company, and we might be required to terminate our Management Agreement and any other agreements with affiliates, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and pay distributions. If we were required to register us as an investment company but failed to do so, we would be prohibited from engaging in our business, and criminal and civil actions could be brought against us. In addition, our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court required enforcement, and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our business.. We expect certain subsidiaries that we may form in the future to rely upon the exception from the definition of \"investment company\" set forth in Section 3(c) (5)(C) of the 1940 Act, which applies to entities \"primarily engaged\" in the business of \"purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.\" This exception, as interpreted by the staff of the SEC, generally requires that at least 55% of a subsidiary's assets must be comprised of qualifying assets and the remaining 45% of the subsidiary's portfolio be comprised of real estate-related assets (as such terms have been interpreted by the staff of the SEC). SEC staff no-action letters have indicated that the foregoing real estate-related assets test will be met if at least 25% of such subsidiary's assets are invested in real estate-related assets, which threshold is subject to reduction to the extent that the subsidiary invested more than 55% of its total assets in qualifying assets, and no more than 20% of such subsidiary's total assets are invested in miscellaneous investments. We expect each of our subsidiaries relying on Section 3(c)(5)(C) to rely on guidance published by the SEC staff and on our analyses of such guidance to determine which assets are qualifying real estate assets and real estate-related assets. However, the SEC's guidance was issued in accordance with factual situations that may be substantially different from the factual situations we may face, and much of the guidance was issued more than 20 years ago. No assurance can be given that the SEC staff will concur with our classification of our assets. In addition, the SEC staff may, in the future, issue further guidance that may require us to re-classify our assets for purposes of qualifying for an exception from the definition of \"investment company\" under the 1940 Act. If we are required to re-classify our subsidiaries' assets, they may no longer be in compliance with the exception from the definition of an \"investment company\" provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act. To the extent that the SEC staff publishes new or different guidance with respect to any assets we have determined to be qualifying or real estate-related assets, we may be required to adjust our strategy accordingly. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make certain investments and these limitations could result in a subsidiary holding assets we might wish to sell or not acquiring or selling assets we might wish to hold.. In addition, our Operating Company and/or our subsidiaries may rely upon other exclusions, including the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(6) of the 1940 Act (which excludes, among other things, parent entities whose primary business is conducted through majority-owned subsidiaries relying upon the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C), discussed above), from the definition of an investment company and the registration requirements under the Investment Company Act. The SEC staff has issued little interpretive guidance with respect to Section 3(c)(6) and any guidance published by the staff could require us to adjust our strategy accordingly.. We determine whether an entity is one of our majority-owned subsidiaries. The 1940 Act defines a majority-owned subsidiary of a person as a company 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of which are owned by such person, or by another company which is a majority-owned subsidiary of such person. The 1940 Act further defines voting securities as any security presently entitling the owner or holder thereof to vote for the election of directors of a company. We treat companies in which we own at least a majority of the outstanding voting securities as majority-owned subsidiaries for purposes of the tests discussed above. We have not requested the SEC to approve our treatment of any company as a majority-owned subsidiary and the SEC has not done so. If the SEC were to disagree with our treatment of one or more companies as majority-owned subsidiaries, we would need to adjust our strategy and our assets in order to continue to pass the 40% test. Any such adjustment in our strategy could have a material adverse effect on us.. In August 2011, the SEC solicited public comment on a wide range of issues relating to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act, including the nature of the assets that qualify for purposes of the exemption and whether mortgage REITs should be regulated in a manner similar to investment companies. There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the 1940 Act status of REITs, including the SEC or. 36. its staff providing more specific or different guidance regarding these exemptions, will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations.. Rapid and steep declines in the values of our self-storage-related investments may make it more difficult for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT or exemption from the 1940 Act.. If the market value or income potential of our self-storage-related investments declines as a result of increased interest rates or other factors, we may need to increase our real estate investments and income and/or liquidate our non-qualifying assets in order to maintain our REIT qualification or exemption from the 1940 Act. If the decline in real estate asset values and/or income occurs quickly, this may be especially difficult to accomplish. This difficulty may be exacerbated by the illiquid nature of any non-qualifying assets that we may own. We may have to make investment decisions that we otherwise would not make absent the REIT and 1940 Act considerations.. Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to recover on claims against our directors and officers are limited, which could reduce your and our recovery against them if they negligently cause us to incur losses.. The MGCL provides that a director has no liability in such capacity if he performs his duties in good faith, in a manner he reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. A director who performs his or her duties in accordance with the foregoing standards should not be liable to us or any other person for failure to discharge his or her obligations as a director.. In addition, our charter provides that our directors and officers will not be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages unless the director or officer actually received an improper personal benefit or profit in money, property or services, or is adjudged to be liable to us or our stockholders based on a finding that his or her action, or failure to act, was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and was material to the cause of action adjudicated in the proceeding. Our charter also requires us, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, to indemnify and, without requiring a preliminary determination of the ultimate entitlement to indemnification, pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding to any individual who is a present or former director or officer and who is made or threatened to be made a party to the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity or any individual who, while a director or officer and at our request, serves or has served as a director, officer, partner, trustee, member or manager of another corporation, REIT, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise and who is made or threatened to be made a party to the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity. With the approval of our Board of Directors, we may provide such indemnification and advance for expenses to any individual who served a predecessor of us in any of the capacities described above and any employee or agent of us or a predecessor of us, including our Manager and its affiliates.. We also are permitted, and intend, to purchase and maintain insurance or provide similar protection on behalf of any directors, officers, employees and agents, including our Manager and its affiliates, against any liability asserted which was incurred in any such capacity with us or arising out of such status. This may result in us having to expend significant funds, which will reduce the available cash for distribution to our stockholders.. Ownership limitations may restrict change of control or business combination opportunities in which our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares.. In order for us to qualify as a REIT for each taxable year after 2015, no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals during the last half of any calendar year. \"Individuals\" for this purpose include natural persons, private foundations, some employee benefit plans and trusts, and some charitable trusts. To preserve our REIT qualification, our charter generally prohibits any person from directly or indirectly owning more than 9.8% in value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock or more than 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock. This ownership limitation could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of our common stock might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price or which holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests.. U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RISKS. Our failure to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal income tax and potentially state and local tax, and would adversely affect our operations and the market price of our common stock.. We elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2015. However, we may terminate our REIT election if our Board of Directors determines that not qualifying as a REIT is in the best interests of our stockholders, or our REIT election may be inadvertently terminated. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. We continue to be organized and operate in a manner designed to satisfy all the requirements for qualification as a REIT. The REIT qualification requirements are extremely complex and interpretation of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing qualification as a REIT is limited. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in operating so we can qualify or remain qualified as a REIT. Our ability to satisfy the REIT asset tests depends on our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. Our compliance with the REIT income or quarterly asset requirements also depends on our ability to successfully manage the. 37. composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, if certain of our operations were to be recharacterized by the IRS, such recharacterization could jeopardize our ability to satisfy all the requirements for qualification as a REIT.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, on December 22, 2017, legislation informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law by the U.S. President. Although we are not aware of any provision in the final tax reform legislation or any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to operate as a REIT, new legislation, as well as new regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions may be introduced, enacted, or promulgated from time to time, that could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification, in a manner that is adverse to our stockholders. Furthermore, future legislative, judicial or administrative changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws could be applied retroactively, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT.. If we fail to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year, and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates. In addition, we would generally be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year of losing our REIT qualification. Losing our REIT qualification would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability. In addition, distributions to stockholders would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction, and we would no longer be required to make distributions. If this occurs, we might be required to borrow funds or liquidate some investments in order to pay the applicable tax.. REITs, in certain circumstances, may incur tax liabilities that would reduce our cash available for distribution to you.. Even if we qualify and maintain our status as a REIT, we may become subject to U.S. federal income taxes and related state and local taxes. For example, net income from the sale of properties (including self-storage facilities or mortgage loans) that are \"dealer\" properties sold by a REIT (a \"prohibited transaction\" under the Code) will be subject to a 100% penalty tax (the \"prohibited transactions tax\"). Also, we may not make sufficient distributions to avoid certain excise taxes applicable to REITs. Similarly, if we were to fail an income test (and did not lose our REIT status because such failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect) we would be subject to tax on the income that does not meet the income test requirements. We also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from the sale or other disposition of our property and pay income tax directly on such income. In that event, our stockholders would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly. However, stockholders that are tax-exempt, such as charities or qualified pension plans, would have no benefit from their deemed payment of such tax liability unless they file U.S. federal income tax returns and thereon seek a refund of such tax. We also may be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property, including franchise, payroll, mortgage recording and transfer taxes, either directly or at the level of the other companies through which we indirectly own our assets, such as our TRSs, which are subject to full U.S. federal, state, local and foreign corporate-level income taxes. Any taxes we pay directly or indirectly will reduce our cash available for distribution to you.. To qualify as a REIT we must meet annual distribution requirements, which may force us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions. This could delay or hinder our ability to meet our investment objectives and reduce your overall return.. In order to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income and net capital gain and will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (a) 85% of our ordinary income, (b) 95% of our capital gain net income and (c) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. These requirements could cause us to distribute amounts that otherwise would be used to fund loans, and it is possible that we might be required to borrow funds, possibly at unfavorable rates, or sell assets to fund these distributions. Although we intend to make distributions sufficient to meet the annual distribution requirements and to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our earnings while we qualify as a REIT, it is possible that we might not always be able to do so.. <U+FEFF>. Certain of our business activities are potentially subject to the prohibited transaction tax, which could reduce the return on your investment.. For so long as we qualify as a REIT, our ability to dispose of property during the first few years following acquisition may be restricted to a substantial extent as a result of our REIT qualification.. Under applicable provisions of the Code regarding prohibited transactions by REITs, we will be subject to the prohibited transactions tax on any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of any property (other than foreclosure property, but including self-storage facilities and mortgage loans held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business) that we own, directly or through any subsidiary entity, but generally excluding our TRSs, that is deemed to be inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. Whether property is inventory or otherwise held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding each property. While we qualify as a REIT, we may avoid the 100% prohibited transaction tax by (a) conducting activities that may otherwise be considered prohibited transactions through a TRS (but such TRS will incur income taxes), (b) conducting our operations in such a manner so that no sale or other disposition of an asset we own, directly or through any subsidiary, will be treated as a prohibited transaction, or (c) structuring certain dispositions of our assets to comply with a prohibited transaction safe harbor available under the Code for assets held for at least two years. However, no assurance can be given that any. 38. particular asset we own, directly or through any subsidiary entity, but generally excluding any TRS of ours, will not be treated as inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.. The tax on prohibited transactions will limit our ability to engage in transactions, including certain methods of securitizing mortgage loans that would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.. A REIT's net income from prohibited transactions is subject to the prohibited transactions tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property. We might be subject to this tax if we were to sell or securitize loans in a manner that was treated as a sale of the loans for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, in order to avoid the prohibited transactions tax, we may choose not to engage in certain sales of loans, other than through a TRS, and we may be required to limit the structures we use for our loan sales, even though such sales or structures might otherwise be beneficial for us. If we sell a first mortgage loan through a TRS, it is possible that gain from the sale of the loan will be recharacterized as though we sold the loan directly. Even if the sale of a loan by a TRS is not recharacterized, any gain on the sale by the TRS will be subject to regular corporate income tax.. TRSs are subject to corporate-level taxes and our dealings with any TRSs we establish may be subject to 100% excise tax.. A REIT may own up to 100% of the stock of one or more TRSs. Both the subsidiary and the REIT must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a TRS. A corporation of which a TRS directly or indirectly owns more than 25% of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a TRS. Overall, no more than 20% of the gross value of a REIT's assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs. In addition, the TRS rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a TRS to its parent REIT to assure that the TRS is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation. The rules also impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's length basis.. TRSs that we may form will pay U.S. federal, state and local income tax on their taxable income, and their after-tax net income will be available for distribution to us but will not be required to be distributed to us, unless necessary to maintain our REIT qualification. While we will monitor the aggregate value of the securities of any TRSs we form and intend to conduct our affairs so that such securities will represent less than 20% of the value of our total assets, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the TRS limitation in all market conditions.. Our investments in certain debt instruments may cause us to recognize \"phantom income\" for U.S. federal income tax purposes even though no cash payments have been received on the debt instruments and certain modifications of such debt by us could cause the modified debt to not qualify as a good REIT asset, thereby jeopardizing our REIT qualification.. Our taxable income may substantially exceed our net income as determined based on GAAP, or differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash may occur. For example, we may acquire assets, including debt securities requiring us to accrue original issue discount, or OID, or recognize market discount income, that generates taxable income in excess of economic income or in advance of the corresponding cash flow from the assets (referred to as \"phantom income\"). Furthermore, if we own an equity interest in an entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes (or are treated as owning such an interest for federal income tax purposes), we may be required to include taxable income without a corresponding cash distribution from such entity. In addition, if a borrower with respect to a particular debt instrument encounters financial difficulty rendering it unable to pay stated interest as due, we may nonetheless be required to continue to recognize the unpaid interest as taxable income with the effect that we will recognize income but will not have a corresponding amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders.. <U+FEFF>. Also, our investment structures may consist of a mortgage loan or mortgage loans as well as a profits or other equity interest in the borrower. It is possible the IRS could disagree with the amount of our investment that we allocate to the mortgage loan or loans (or between such loans) and the profits or other equity interest. If the IRS successfully allocated less of our investment to the mortgage loan or loans, it is possible such allocation could result in an increased amount of OID with respect to such loans. As described above, the OID could generate phantom income.. As a result of the foregoing, we may generate less cash flow than taxable income in a particular year and find it difficult or impossible to meet the REIT distribution requirements in certain circumstances. In such circumstances, we may be required to (a) sell assets in adverse market conditions, (b) borrow on unfavorable terms, (c) distribute amounts that would otherwise be used for future acquisitions or used to repay debt, or (d) make a taxable distribution of our shares of common stock as part of a distribution in which stockholders may elect to receive shares of common stock or (subject to a limit measured as a percentage of the total distribution) cash, in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements.. The failure of a mezzanine loan to qualify as a real estate asset would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.. In order for a loan to be treated as a qualifying real estate asset producing qualifying income for purposes of the REIT asset and income tests, generally the loan must be secured by real property. We may originate or acquire mezzanine loans that are not directly secured by real property but instead secured by equity interests in a partnership or limited liability company that directly or indirectly owns real property. In Revenue Procedure 2003-65, the IRS provided a safe harbor pursuant to which a mezzanine loan that is not secured by real estate would, if it meets each of the requirements contained in the Revenue Procedure, be treated by the IRS as a qualifying real estate asset. Although the Revenue Procedure provides a safe harbor on which taxpayers may rely, it does not prescribe rules of substantive tax law and in many cases it may not. 39. be possible for us to meet all the requirements of the safe harbor. We cannot provide assurance that any mezzanine loan in which we invest would be treated as a qualifying asset producing qualifying income for REIT qualification purposes. If any such loan fails either the REIT income or asset tests, we may be disqualified as a REIT.. We may own equity participations in the form of equity interests in our borrowers, in which case our ability to qualify as a REIT could be affected by our borrowers' compliance with various operating covenants.. Some of our equity participations are structured as equity interests in our borrowers. For purposes of the REIT asset and income tests, our equity interest in a borrower that is a partnership for federal income tax purposes will represent an interest in the borrower's income or assets based on our capital interest in the partnership. We intend to obtain covenants from borrowers in which we own an equity interest that require the borrower to hold nearly all qualifying assets for purposes of the REIT 75% asset test and earn nearly all of its income from qualifying income for purposes of the REIT 75% and 95% income tests. If a borrower does not comply with such covenants, our ability to qualify as a REIT could be adversely affected. Alternatively, we may hold equity interests in borrowers through a TRS, in which case income derived from the equity interest may be subject to U.S. federal, state or local income tax.. Our qualification as a REIT and exemption from U.S. federal income tax with respect to certain assets may be dependent on the accuracy of legal opinions or advice rendered or given or statements by the issuers of assets that we acquire, and the inaccuracy of any such opinions, advice or statements may adversely affect our REIT qualification and result in significant corporate-level tax.. When purchasing securities, we may rely on opinions or advice of counsel for the issuer of such securities, or statements made in related offering documents, for purposes of determining whether such securities represent debt or equity securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and also to what extent those securities constitute real estate assets for purposes of the asset tests and produce qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test. The inaccuracy of any such opinions, advice or statements may adversely affect our REIT qualification and result in significant corporate-level tax.. <U+FEFF>. We may choose to make distributions in our own stock, in which case you may be required to pay income taxes in excess of the cash dividends you receive.. In connection with our qualification as a REIT, we are required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. In order to satisfy this requirement, we may make distributions that are payable in cash and/or shares of our common stock (which could account for up to 80% of the aggregate amount of such distributions) at the election of each stockholder. Taxable stockholders receiving such distributions will be required to include the full amount of such distributions as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. stockholders may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such distributions in excess of the cash portion of the distribution received. Accordingly, stockholders receiving a distribution of our shares may be required to sell shares received in such distribution or may be required to sell other stock or assets owned by them, at a time that may be disadvantageous, in order to satisfy any tax imposed on such distribution. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock that it receives as part of the distribution in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount it must include in income with respect to the distribution, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such distribution, including in respect of all or a portion of such distribution that is payable in stock, by withholding or disposing of part of the shares included in such distribution and using the proceeds of such disposition to satisfy the withholding tax imposed. In addition, if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividend income, such sale may put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock.. Various tax aspects of such a taxable cash/stock distribution are uncertain and have not yet been addressed by the IRS. No assurance can be given that the IRS will not impose requirements in the future with respect to taxable cash/stock distributions, including on a retroactive basis, or assert that the requirements for such taxable cash/stock distributions have not been met.. Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.. Qualified dividend income payable to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is subject to the reduced maximum tax rate applicable to capital gains. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. The more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including our common stock. Our ordinary dividends generally are taxed at the higher tax rates applicable to ordinary income, the current maximum rate of which is 37%. However, for taxable years prior to 2026, individual stockholders are generally allowed to deduct 20% of the aggregate amount of ordinary dividends distributed by us, subject to certain limitations, which would reduce the maximum marginal effective tax rate for individuals on the receipt of such ordinary dividends to 29.6%.. 40. Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.. The REIT provisions of the Code may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities. Any income from a hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes, price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets, if properly identified under applicable Treasury Regulations, does not constitute \"gross income\" for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions will likely be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRSs would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses in a TRS generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward against future taxable income of such TRS.. Complying with REIT requirements may force us to forgo and/or liquidate otherwise attractive investment opportunities.. To qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that we meet the REIT gross income tests annually and that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets, including certain mortgage loans and certain kinds of mortgage-related securities. The remainder of our investment in securities (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our assets (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 25% of the value of our total securities can be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we may be required to liquidate assets from our portfolio or not make otherwise attractive investments in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.. <U+FEFF>. We may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could increase our tax liability, reduce our operating flexibility and reduce the price of our common stock.. In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in shares of our common stock. Additional changes to the tax laws are likely to continue to occur, and we cannot assure you that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder. Any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our shares or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets. You are urged to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the impact of recent legislation on your investment in our shares and the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our shares. You also should note that our counsel's tax opinion is based upon existing law, applicable as of the date of its opinion, all of which will be subject to change, either prospectively or retroactively.. Although REITs generally receive better tax treatment than entities taxed as regular corporations, it is possible that future legislation would result in a REIT having fewer tax advantages, and it could become more advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a corporation. As a result, our charter provides our Board of Directors with the power, under certain circumstances, to revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election and cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation, without the vote of our stockholders.
