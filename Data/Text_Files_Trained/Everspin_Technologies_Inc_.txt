[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors.. The following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or such other risks actually occurs, our business could be harmed.. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Our Industry. We have a history of losses which may continue in the future, and we cannot be certain that we will achieve or sustain profitability.. We have incurred net losses since our inception. We incurred net losses of $21.1 million, $16.7 million and $18.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $117.5 million. We expect to incur significant expenses related to the continued development and expansion of our business, including in connection with our efforts to develop and improve upon our products and technology, maintain and enhance our research and development and sales and marketing activities and hire additional personnel. While our products offer unique benefits over other industry memory technologies, our per-bit cost to product our product is currently higher than competing technologies. As a result, our ability to capture market share and generate sufficient revenue to transition to profitability and generate consistent positive cash flows is uncertain. We do not know whether our revenue will grow rapidly enough to absorb these costs, and our limited operating history makes it difficult to assess the extent of these expenses, or their impact on our results of operations.. Further, our revenue may not increase or may decline for a number of possible reasons, many of which are outside our control, including a decline in demand for our products, increased competition, business conditions that adversely affect the semiconductor memory industry, including reduced demand for products in the end markets that we serve, or our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities. If we fail to generate sufficient revenue to support our operations, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects.. We have been in existence as a stand-alone company since 2008, when Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. spun-out its MRAM business as Everspin. We have been shipping magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) products since our incorporation in 2008, and we have experienced a high rate of growth for our products. However, we may not be able to sustain the growth rate for sales of these products and our revenue could decline. We are just starting the manufacture of Spin Transfer Torque MRAM, (STT-MRAM) products. Adoption of these products is important to the future growth of our business, but revenue associated with these products has not been material to date.. Our limited operating history and limited experience selling products, combined with the rapidly evolving and competitive nature of our market, makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects. In addition, we have limited insight into emerging trends that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, including unpredictable and volatile revenue and increased expenses as we continue to grow our business. The viability and demand for our products may be affected by many factors outside of our control, such as the factors affecting the growth of the industrial, automotive and transportation, and enterprise storage industries and changes in macroeconomic conditions. If we do not manage these risks and overcome these difficulties successfully, our business will suffer.. 13. Table of Contents. We may be unable to match production with customer demand for a variety of reasons including our inability to accurately forecast customer demand or the capacity constraints of our suppliers, which could adversely affect our operating results.. We make planning and spending decisions, including determining production levels, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of product demand and customer requirements. Our products are typically purchased pursuant to individual purchase orders. While our customers may provide us with their demand forecasts, they are not contractually committed to buy any quantity of products beyond purchase orders. Furthermore, many of our customers may increase, decrease, cancel or delay purchase orders already in place without significant penalty. The short-term nature of commitments by our customers and the possibility of unexpected changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements. On occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production, which can strain our resources, necessitate more onerous procurement commitments and reduce our gross margin. If we overestimate customer demand, we may purchase products that we may not be able to sell, which could result in decreases in our prices or write-downs of unsold inventory. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand or if sufficient manufacturing capacity is unavailable, we could lose sales opportunities and could lose market share or damage our customer relationships. We manufacture MRAM products at our 200mm facility we lease in Chandler, Arizona and use a single foundry, GLOBALFOUNDRIES Singapore Pte. Ltd., for production of higher density products on advanced technology nodes, which may not have sufficient capacity to meet customer demand. The rapid pace of innovation in our industry could also render significant portions of our inventory obsolete. Excess or obsolete inventory levels could result in unexpected expenses or write-downs of inventory values that could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.. We may require additional capital to fund our business, which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all.. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017, coupled with our anticipated growth and sales levels, and net proceeds from the follow-on underwritten public offering in February 2018, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months from the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities, the timing and cost of establishing additional sales and marketing capabilities, and the introduction of new products. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing, and we cannot assure you that any such additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate sufficient cash from operations to adequately fund our operations, we will need to curtail planned activities to reduce costs. Doing so will likely harm our ability to execute on our business plan.. If we raise additional funds through issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.. As we expand into new potential markets, we expect to face intense competition, including from our customers and potential customers, and may not be able to compete effectively, which could harm our business.. We expect that our new and future MRAM products will be applicable to markets in which we are not currently operating. Selling into these markets, including higher density memory markets and the module business could put us into direct competition with our current or potential customers or other competitors with substantially more resources and experience than us. The markets in which we operate and may operate in the future are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change, continuous evolving customer requirements and declining average selling prices. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or potential competitors, which include our current or potential customers as they seek to internally develop solutions competitive with ours or as we develop products potentially competitive with their existing products. If we do not compete successfully, our market share and revenue may decline. We compete with large semiconductor manufacturers and designers and others, and our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources and name recognition and a larger base of customers than we do. This may allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging. 14. Table of Contents. technologies or changes in customer requirements. In addition, these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential customers. Some of our current and potential customers with their own internally developed solutions may choose not to purchase products from third-party suppliers like us.. We rely on third parties to distribute, manufacture, package, assemble and test our products, which exposes us to a number of risks, including reduced control over manufacturing and delivery timing and potential exposure to price fluctuations, which could result in a loss of revenue or reduced profitability.. Although we operate an integrated magnetic fabrication line located in Chandler, Arizona, we purchase wafers from third parties and outsource the manufacturing, packaging, assembly and testing of our products to third-party foundries and assembly and testing service providers. We use a single foundry, GLOBALFOUNDRIES Singapore Pte. Ltd., for production of higher density products on advanced technology nodes. Our primary product package and test operations are located in China, Taiwan and other Asian countries. We also use standard CMOS wafers from third-party foundries, which we process at our Chandler, Arizona, facility.. Relying on third-party distribution, manufacturing, assembly, packaging and testing presents a number of risks, including but not limited to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour interests could diverge from those of our foundries, or we may not be able to agree with them on ongoing development, manufacturing and operational activities, or on the amount, timing, or nature of further investments in our joint development;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcapacity and materials shortages during periods of high demand;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduced control over delivery schedules, inventories and quality;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe unavailability of, or potential delays in obtaining access to, key process technologies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability to achieve required production or test capacity and acceptable yields on a timely basis;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmisappropriation of our intellectual property;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe third party's ability to perform its obligations due to bankruptcy or other financial constraints;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texclusive representatives for certain customer engagements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimited warranties on wafers or products supplied to us; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential increases in prices.. We currently do not have long-term supply contracts with our third-party contract manufacturers for our MRAM products, including NXP, United Microelectronics Corporation, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Limited (TSMC), United Test and Assembly Center (UTAC), Global Testing Corporation (GTC), ChipMos, OSE Taiwan, and Amkor, and we typically negotiate pricing on a per-purchase order basis and in some cases on an annual basis. Therefore, they are not obligated to perform services or supply components to us for any specific period, in any specific quantities, or at any specific price, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. During periods of high demand and tight inventories, our third-party foundries and packaging, assembly and testing contractors may allocate capacity to the production of other companies' products while reducing deliveries to us, or significantly raise their prices. In particular, they may allocate capacity to other customers that are larger and better financed than us or that have long-term agreements, decreasing the capacity available to us. Shortages of capacity available to us may be caused by the actions of their other, large customers that may be difficult to predict, such as major product launches.. Our manufacturing agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES includes a customary forecast and ordering mechanism for the supply of certain of our wafers, and we are obligated to order and pay for, and GLOBALFOUNDRIES is obligated to supply, wafers consistent with the binding portion of our forecast. However, our manufacturing arrangement is also subject to both a minimum and maximum order quantity that while we believe currently addresses our projected foundry capacity needs, may not address our maximum foundry capacity requirements in the future. We may also be obligated to pay for unused capacity if our demand decreases in the future, or if our estimates prove inaccurate. GLOBALFOUNDRIES also has the ability to discontinue its manufacture of any of our wafers upon due notice and completion of the notice period. This could cause us to have to find another foundry to manufacture those wafers or redesign our core technology and would mean that we may not have products to sell until such time. Any time spent. 15. Table of Contents. engaging a new manufacturer or redesigning our core technology could be costly and time consuming and may allow potential competitors to take opportunities in the market place. Moreover, if we are unable to find another foundry to manufacture our products or if we have to redesign our core technology, this could cause material harm to our business and operating results.. If we need other foundries or packaging, assembly and testing contractors, or if we are unable to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from our providers, we might not be able to cost-effectively and quickly retain other vendors to satisfy our requirements. Because the lead-time needed to establish a relationship with a new third-party supplier could be several quarters, there is no readily available alternative source of supply for any specific component. In addition, the time and expense to qualify a new foundry could result in additional expense, diversion of resources or lost sales, any of which would negatively impact our financial results.. If any of our current or future foundries or packaging, assembly and testing subcontractors significantly increases the costs of wafers or other materials or services, interrupts or reduces our supply, including for reasons outside of their control, or if any of our relationships with our suppliers is terminated, our operating results could be adversely affected. Such occurrences could also damage our customer relationships, result in lost revenue, cause a loss in market share or damage our reputation.. Our joint development agreement and strategic relationships involve numerous risks.. We have entered into strategic relationships to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products. These relationships include our joint development agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES to develop advanced MTJ technology and STT-MRAM. These relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations. These risks include the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour interests could diverge from those of our foundries, or we may not be able to agree with them on ongoing development, manufacturing and operational activities, or on the amount, timing, or nature of further investments in our joint development;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may experience difficulties in transferring technology to a foundry;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may experience difficulties and delays in getting to and/or ramping production at foundries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour control over the operations of foundries is limited;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdue to financial constraints, our joint development collaborators may be unable to meet their commitments to us and may pose credit risks for our transactions with them;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdue to differing business models or long-term business goals, our collaborators may decide not to join us in funding capital investment, which may result in higher levels of cash expenditures by us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour cash flows may be inadequate to fund increased capital requirements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may experience difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from our collaborators;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe terms of our arrangements may turn out to be unfavorable;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe are migrating toward a fabless model as 300mm production becomes required and this increases risks related to less control over our critical production processes; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in tax, legal, or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes in our agreements.. Further, GLOBALFOUNDRIES may terminate the joint development agreement with us if we materially breach a term of the agreement, such as, but not limited to, by our failing to pay any undisputed sum which has been outstanding for 45 or more days from the date of invoice, and fail to remedy the breach within 60 days after receiving notice from GLOBALFOUNDRIES. If GLOBALFOUNDRIES terminates the joint development agreement, our ability to continue to develop our MRAM technology will be significantly impaired.. If our strategic relationships are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.. 16. Table of Contents. The market for semiconductor memory products is characterized by declines in average selling prices, which we expect to continue, and which could negatively affect our revenue and margins.. Our customers expect the average selling price of our products to decrease year-over-year and we expect this trend to continue. When such pricing declines occur, we may not be able to mitigate the effects by selling more or higher margin units, or by reducing our manufacturing costs. In such circumstances, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Our stand-alone and embedded MRAM products have experienced declining average selling prices over their life cycle. The rate of decline may be affected by a number of factors, including relative supply and demand, the level of competition, production costs and technological changes. As a result of the decreasing average selling prices of our products following their launch, our ability to increase or maintain our margins depends on our ability to introduce new or enhanced products with higher average selling prices and to reduce our per-unit cost of sales and our operating costs. We may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own manufacturing, assembly and testing facilities, and our costs may even increase because we rely in part on third parties to manufacture, assemble and test our products, which could also reduce our gross margins. In addition, our new or enhanced products may not be as successful or enjoy as high margins as we expect. If we are unable to offset any reductions in average selling prices by introducing new products with higher average selling prices or reducing our costs, our revenue and margins will be negatively affected and may decrease.. The semiconductor memory market is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns in the past, generally as a result of wide fluctuations in supply and demand, constant and rapid technological change, continuous new product introductions and price erosion. During downturns, periods of intense competition, or the presence of oversupply in the industry, the selling prices for our products may decline at a high rate over relatively short time periods as compared to historical rates of decline. We are unable to predict selling prices for any future periods and may experience unanticipated, sharp declines in selling prices for our products.. Unfavorable economic and market conditions, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. We have significant customer sales both in the U.S. and internationally. We also rely on domestic and international suppliers, manufacturing partners and distributors. We are therefore susceptible to adverse U.S. and international economic and market conditions. If any of our manufacturing partners, customers, distributors or suppliers experience serious financial difficulties or cease operations, our business will be adversely affected. In addition, the adverse impact of an unfavorable economy may adversely impact customer spending, which may adversely impact demand for our products.. We must continuously develop new and enhanced products, and if we are unable to successfully market our new and enhanced products for which we incur significant expenses to develop, our results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.. To compete effectively in our markets, we must continually design, develop and introduce new and improved products with improved features in a cost-effective manner in response to changing technologies and market demand. This requires us to devote substantial financial and other resources to research and development. We are developing new products, which we expect to be one of the drivers of our revenue growth in the future. However, as it is taking us longer than we expected to develop our 1Gb STT-MRAM product, we may not succeed in developing and marketing this and other new and enhanced products. We also face the risk that customers may not value or be willing to bear the cost of incorporating our new and enhanced products into their products, particularly if they believe their customers are satisfied with current solutions. Regardless of the improved features or superior performance of our new and enhanced products, customers may be unwilling to adopt our solutions due to design or pricing constraints, or because they do not want to rely on a single or limited supply source. Because of the extensive time and resources that we invest in developing new and enhanced products, if we are unable to sell customers our new products, our revenue could decline and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be negatively affected. For example, we generated limited revenue from sales of our STT-MRAM products to date. While we expect revenue from our STT-MRAM products to increase, if we are unable to scale MRAM to gigabit densities to address applications currently served by DRAM, we may not be able to materially increase our revenue. If we are unable to successfully develop and market our new and enhanced products that we have incurred significant expenses developing, our results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.. 17. Table of Contents. Our success and future revenue depend on our ability to secure design wins and on our customers' ability to successfully sell the products that incorporate our solutions. Securing design wins is a lengthy, expensive and competitive process, and may not result in actual orders and sales, which could cause our revenue to decline.. We sell to customers that incorporate MRAM into their products. A design win occurs after a customer has tested our product, verified that it meets the customer's requirements and qualified our solutions for their products. We believe we are dependent on the adoption of our 256Mb and 1Gb MRAM products by our customers to secure design wins. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded revenue for our first sale of 40nm 256Mb STT-MRAM products and we are in process of ramping up production in 2018. To date we have not sold any of our 1Gb MRAM products. Our customers may need several months to years to test, evaluate and adopt our product and additional time to begin volume production of the product that incorporates our solution. Due to this generally lengthy design cycle, we may experience significant delays from the time we increase our operating expenses and make investments in our products to the time that we generate revenue from sales of these products. Moreover, even if a customer selects our solution, we cannot guarantee that this will result in any sales of our products, as the customer may ultimately change or cancel its product plans, or efforts by our customer to market and sell its product may not be successful. We may not generate any revenue from design wins after incurring the associated costs, which would cause our business and operating results to suffer. Any delay in the development of our 256Mb and 1Gb MRAM products, or failure of our customers to adopt our 256Mb and 1Gb MRAM products, could inhibit revenue growth or cause declines, which would significantly harm our business and prevent us from becoming profitable.. If a current or prospective customer designs a competitor's solution into its product, it becomes significantly more difficult for us to sell our solutions to that customer because changing suppliers involves significant time, cost, effort and risk for the customer even if our solutions are superior to other solutions and remain compatible with their product design. Our ability to compete successfully depends on customers viewing us as a stable and reliable supplier to mission critical customer applications when we have less production capacity and less financial resources compared to most of our larger competitors. If current or prospective customers do not include our solutions in their products and we fail to achieve a sufficient number of design wins, our results of operations and business may be harmed.. We rely on our relationships with OEMs and ODMs to enhance our solutions and market position, and our failure to continue to develop or maintain such relationships in the future would harm our ability to remain competitive.. We develop our products for leading OEMs and ODMs that serve a variety of end markets and are developing devices for automotive, transportation, industrial and storage applications. For each application, manufacturers create products that incorporate specialized semiconductor technology, which makers of memory products use as the basis for their products. These manufacturers set the specifications for many of the key components to be used on each generation of their products and, in the case of memory components, generally qualify only a few vendors to provide memory components for their products. As each new generation of their products is released, vendors are validated in a similar fashion. We must work closely with OEMs and ODMs to ensure our products become qualified for use in their products. As a result, maintaining close relationships with leading OEMs and ODMs that are developing devices for automotive, transportation, industrial and storage applications is crucial to the long-term success of our business. We could lose these relationships for a variety of reasons, including our failure to qualify as a vendor, our failure to demonstrate the value of our new solutions, declines in product quality, or if OEMs or ODMs seek to work with vendors with broader product suites, greater production capacity or greater financial resources. If our relationships with key industry participants were to deteriorate or if our solutions were not qualified by our customers, our market position and revenue could be materially and adversely affected.. The loss of one or several of our customers or reduced orders or pricing from existing customers may have a significant adverse effect on our operations and financial results.. We have derived and expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small group of customers during any particular period due in part to the concentration of market share in the semiconductor industry. Our four largest end customers together accounted for 28% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, but none of these customers individually accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue during the period. Our four largest end customers together accounted for 32% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, but none of these customers individually accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue during the period. Our four largest end customers together accounted for 41% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, and two customers each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue during the period. The loss of a significant customer, a business. 18. Table of Contents. combination among our customers, a reduction in orders or decrease in price from a significant customer or disruption in any of our commercial or distributor arrangements may result in a significant decline in our revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.. Our results of operations can fluctuate from period to period, which could cause our share price to fluctuate.. Our results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate from period to period in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include the following factors, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this report:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe receipt, reduction, delay or cancellation of orders by large customers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe gain or loss of significant customers or distributors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing and success of our launch of new or enhanced products and those of our competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmarket acceptance of our products and our customers' products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of growth or decline in the industrial, automotive and transportation, enterprise storage and other markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing and extent of research and development and sales and marketing expenditures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in our product mix;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompetitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in sales by and inventory levels of OEMs and ODMs that incorporate our memory products in their products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in the manufacturing yields of our third-party manufacturers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tquality issues that arise from manufacturing issues at our third-party manufacturers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tevents that impact the availability of production capacity at our third-party subcontractors and other interruptions in the supply chain including due to geopolitical events, natural disasters, materials shortages, bankruptcy or other causes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsupply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our customers' products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing of expenses related to the acquisition of technologies or businesses;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct rates of return or price concessions in excess of those expected or forecasted;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcosts associated with the repair and replacement of defective products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunexpected inventory write-downs or write-offs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcosts associated with litigation over intellectual property rights and other litigation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe length and unpredictability of the purchasing and budgeting cycles of our customers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in accounting standards, such as revenue recognition, which we are required to adopt beginning in 2018;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in tax laws, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 recently enacted;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of key personnel or the inability to attract qualified engineers; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeopolitical events, such as war, threat of war or terrorist actions, or the occurrence of natural disasters.. 19. Table of Contents. The semiconductor memory industry is highly cyclical and our markets may experience significant cyclical fluctuations in demand as a result of changing economic conditions, budgeting and buying patterns of customers and other factors. As a result of these and other factors affecting demand for our products and our results of operations in any given period, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indicative of our future revenue or operating performance. Fluctuations in our revenue and operating results could also cause our stock price to decline.. If sales of our customers' products decline or if their products do not achieve market acceptance, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.. Our revenue depends on our customers' ability to commercialize their products successfully. The markets for our customers' products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change. Competition in our customers' markets is based on a variety of factors including price, performance, product quality, marketing and distribution capability, customer support, name recognition and financial strength. As a result of rapid technological change, the markets for our customers' products are characterized by frequent product introductions, short product life cycles, fluctuating demand and increasing product capabilities. As a result, our customers' products may not achieve market success or may become obsolete. We cannot assure you that our customers will dedicate the resources necessary to promote and commercialize their products, successfully execute their business strategies for such products, or be able to manufacture such products in quantities sufficient to meet demand or cost-effectively manufacture products at a high volume. Our customers do not have contracts with us that require them to manufacture, distribute or sell any products. Moreover, our customers may develop internally, or in collaboration with our competitors, technology that they may utilize instead of the technology available to them through us. Our customers' failure to achieve market success for their products, including as a result of general declines in our customers' markets or industries, could negatively affect their willingness to utilize our products, which may result in a decrease in our revenue and negatively affect our business and operating results.. Our revenue also depends on the timely introduction, quality and market acceptance of our customers' products that incorporate our solutions. Our customers' products are often very complex and subject to design complexities that may result in design flaws, as well as potential defects, errors and bugs. We incur significant design and development costs in connection with designing our solutions for customers' products. If our customers discover design flaws, defects, errors or bugs in their products, or if they experience changing market requirements, failed evaluations or field trials, or issues with other vendors, they may delay, change or cancel a project. If we have already incurred significant development costs, we may not be able to recoup those costs, which in turn would adversely affect our business and financial results.. We face competition and expect competition to increase in the future. If we fail to compete effectively, our revenue growth and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.. The global semiconductor market in general, and the semiconductor memory market in particular, are highly competitive. We expect competition to increase and intensify as other semiconductor companies enter our markets, many of which have greater financial and other resources with which to pursue technology development, product design, manufacturing, marketing and sales and distribution of their products. Increased competition could result in price pressure, reduced profitability and loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, revenue and operating results. Currently, our competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of traditional memory technologies to companies specializing in other alternative, specialized emerging memory technologies. Our primary memory competitors include Cypress, Fujitsu, Integrated Silicon Solution, Macronix, Microchip, Micron, Renesas, Samsung, and Toshiba. The main competition for sensor products includes AMR, Crocus, GMR and Hall Effect. These technologies directly compete with our products and are supplied by Alps, Asahi Kasei Microdevices, Fairchild, Invensys (now Schneider), Kionix and Micronas. In addition, as the MRAM market opportunity grows, we expect new entrants such as Avalanche will enter this market and existing competitors, including leading semiconductor companies, may make significant investments to compete more effectively against our products. These competitors could develop technologies or architectures that make our products or technologies obsolete.. Our ability to compete successfully depends on factors both within and outside of our control, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe functionality and performance of our products and those of our competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour relationships with our customers and other industry participants;. 20. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprices of our products and prices of our competitors' products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to develop innovative products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour competitors' greater resources to make acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to obtain adequate capital to finance operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to retain high-level talent, including our management team and engineers; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe actions of our competitors, including merger and acquisition activity, launches of new products and other actions that could change the competitive landscape.. Competition could result in pricing pressure, reduced revenue and loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects. In the event of a market downturn, competition in the markets in which we operate may intensify as our customers reduce their purchase orders. Our competitors that are significantly larger and have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, customer support and other resources or more established market recognition than us may be better positioned to accept lower prices and withstand adverse economic or market conditions.. Our customers require our products and our third-party contractors to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, our business and operating results would suffer.. Prior to selecting and purchasing our products, our customers typically require that our products undergo extensive qualification processes, which involve testing of our products in the customers' systems, as well as testing for reliability. This qualification process may continue for several months or years. However, obtaining the requisite qualifications for a memory product does not assure any sales of the product. Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision in our third-party contractors' manufacturing process or our selection of a new contract manufacturer may require a new qualification process, which may result in delays and excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified and selected, it can and often does take several months or more before the customer commences volume production of systems that incorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, to qualify our products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, sales of those products may be precluded or delayed, which may impede our growth and harm our business.. Our costs may increase substantially if we or our third-party manufacturing contractors do not achieve satisfactory product yields or quality.. The fabrication process is extremely complicated and small changes in design, specifications or materials can result in material decreases in product yields or even the suspension of production. From time to time, we and/or the third-party foundries that we contract to manufacture our products may experience manufacturing defects and reduced manufacturing yields. In some cases, we and/or our third-party foundries may not be able to detect these defects early in the fabrication process or determine the cause of such defects in a timely manner. There may be a higher risk of product yield issues in newer STT-MRAM products.. Generally, in pricing our products, we assume that manufacturing yields will continue to improve, even as the complexity of our products increases. Once our products are initially qualified either internally or with our third-party foundries, minimum acceptable yields are established. We are responsible for the costs of the units if the actual yield is above the minimum set with our third-party foundries. If actual yields are below the minimum we are not required to purchase the units. Typically, minimum acceptable yields for our new products are generally lower at first and gradually improve as we achieve full production, but yield issues can occur even in mature processes due to break downs in mechanical systems, equipment failures or calibration errors. Unacceptably low product yields or other product manufacturing problems could substantially increase overall production time and costs and adversely impact our operating results. Product yield losses will increase our costs and reduce our gross margin. In addition to significantly harming our results of operations and cash flow, poor yields may delay shipment of our products and harm our relationships with existing and potential customers.. 21. Table of Contents. The complexity of our products may lead to defects, which could negatively impact our reputation with customers and result in liability.. Products as complex as ours may contain defects when first introduced to customers or as new versions are released. Delivery of products with production defects or reliability, quality or compatibility problems could significantly delay or hinder market acceptance of the products or result in a costly recall and could damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers. Defects could cause problems with the functionality of our products, resulting in interruptions, delays or cessation of sales of these products to our customers. We may also be required to make significant expenditures of capital and resources to resolve such problems. We cannot assure you that problems will not be found in new products, both before and after commencement of commercial production, despite testing by us, our suppliers or our customers. Any such problems could result in:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelays in development, manufacture and roll-out of new products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadditional development costs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of, or delays in, market acceptance;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tclaims for damages by our customers or others against us; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of credibility with our current and prospective customers.. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We may experience difficulties in transitioning to new wafer fabrication process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration, which may result in reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses.. We aim to use the most advanced manufacturing process technology appropriate for our solutions that is available from our third-party foundries. As a result, we periodically evaluate the benefits of migrating our solutions to other technologies to improve performance and reduce costs. These ongoing efforts require us from time to time to modify the manufacturing processes for our products and to redesign some products, which in turn may result in delays in product deliveries. We may face difficulties, delays and increased expense as we transition our products to new processes, and potentially to new foundries. We will depend on our third-party foundries as we transition to new processes. We cannot assure you that our third-party foundries will be able to effectively manage such transitions or that we will be able to maintain our relationship with our third-party foundries or develop relationships with new third-party foundries. If we or any of our third-party foundries experience significant delays in transitioning to new processes or fail to efficiently implement transitions, we could experience reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses, any of which could harm our relationships with our customers and our operating results.. As smaller line width geometry manufacturing processes become more prevalent, we intend to move our future products to increasingly smaller geometries to reduce costs while integrating greater levels of functionality into our products. This transition will require us and our third-party foundries to migrate to new designs and manufacturing processes for smaller geometry products. We may not be able to achieve smaller geometries with higher levels of design integration or to deliver new integrated products on a timely basis. We periodically evaluate the benefits, on a product-by-product basis, of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs and increase performance. We are dependent on our relationships with our third-party foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. We cannot assure you that our third-party foundries will be able to effectively manage any such transition. If we or our third-party foundries experience significant delays in any such transition or fail to implement a transition, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.. Changes to industry standards and technical requirements relevant to our products and markets could adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.. Our products are only a part of larger electronic systems. All products incorporated into these systems must comply with various industry standards and technical requirements created by regulatory bodies or industry participants to operate efficiently together. Industry standards and technical requirements in our markets are evolving and may change significantly over time. For our products, the industry standards are developed by the Joint Electron Device Engineering. 22. Table of Contents. Council, an industry trade organization. In addition, large industry-leading semiconductor and electronics companies play a significant role in developing standards and technical requirements for the product ecosystems within which our products can be used. Our customers also may design certain specifications and other technical requirements specific to their products and solutions. These technical requirements may change as the customer introduces new or enhanced products and solutions.. Our ability to compete in the future will depend on our ability to identify and comply with evolving industry standards and technical requirements. The emergence of new industry standards and technical requirements could render our products incompatible with products developed by other suppliers or make it difficult for our products to meet the requirements of certain of our customers in automotive, transportation, industrial, storage and other markets. As a result, we could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards and requirements. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards and technical requirements for a significant period of time, we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins, our revenue may decline and we may incur significant expenses to redesign our products to meet the relevant standards, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.. Failure to protect our intellectual property could substantially harm our business.. Our success and ability to compete depend in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, mask work protection, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and know-how, in the United States and other jurisdictions. The steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate, particularly in foreign jurisdictions such as China. Any patents we hold may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights or our products against competitors, and third parties may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of our issued patents, which third parties may have significantly more financial resources with which to litigate their claims than we have to defend against them. In addition, other parties may independently develop similar or competing technologies designed around any patents or patent applications that we hold. Some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application, as we do not believe patent protection of these products and technologies is critical to our business strategy at this time. A failure to timely seek patent protection on products or technologies generally precludes us from seeking future patent protection on these products or technologies.. In addition to patents, we also rely on contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, distributors, employees and consultants, and we implement security measures designed to protect our trade secrets and know-how. However, we cannot assure you that these contractual protections and security measures will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our customers, suppliers, distributors, employees or consultants will not assert rights to intellectual property or damages arising out of such contracts.. We may initiate claims against third parties to protect our intellectual property rights if we are unable to resolve matters satisfactorily through negotiation. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management. It could also result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property, as an adverse decision could limit our ability to assert our intellectual property rights, limit the value of our technology or otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, any enforcement of our patents or other intellectual property may provoke third parties to assert counterclaims against us. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could materially harm our business.. We may face claims of intellectual property infringement, which could be time-consuming, costly to defend or settle, result in the loss of significant rights, harm our relationships with our customers and distributors, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. The semiconductor memory industry is characterized by companies that hold patents and other intellectual property rights and that vigorously pursue, protect and enforce intellectual property rights. These companies include patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may provide little or no deterrence. From time to time, third parties may assert against us and our customers' patent and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business. We have in the past, and may in the future, face such claims.. 23. Table of Contents. Claims that our products, processes or technology infringe third-party intellectual property rights, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly to defend or settle and could divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners in connection with any such litigation, which could result in increased costs. Infringement claims also could harm our relationships with our customers or distributors and might deter future customers from doing business with us. If any such proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products, processes or technology;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpay substantial damages for infringement;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpend significant resources to develop non-infringing products, processes or technology, which may not be successful;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlicense technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcross-license our technology to a competitor to resolve an infringement claim, which could weaken our ability to compete with that competitor; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpay substantial damages to our customers to discontinue their use of or to replace infringing technology sold to them with non-infringing technology, if available.. Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our exposure to the foregoing risks may also be increased if we acquire other companies or technologies. For example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. In addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to the acquisition.. We make significant investments in new technologies and products that may not achieve technological feasibility or profitability or that may limit our revenue growth.. We have made and will continue to make significant investments in research and development of new technologies and products, including new and more technically advanced versions of our MRAM technology.. Investments in new technologies are speculative and technological feasibility may not be achieved. Commercial success depends on many factors including demand for innovative technology, availability of materials and equipment, selling price the market is willing to bear, competition and effective licensing or product sales. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product investments for a number of years, if at all. Moreover, new technologies and products may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically or originally anticipated. Our inability to capitalize on or realize substantial revenue from our significant investments in research and development could harm our operating results and distract management, harming our business.. Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, and our failure to do so could harm our ability to grow our business and execute our business strategies.. Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain our key employees, including our management team and experienced engineers. Competition for personnel in the semiconductor memory technology field, and in the MRAM space in particular, is intense, and the availability of suitable and qualified candidates is limited. We compete to attract and retain qualified research and development personnel with other semiconductor companies, universities and research institutions. Given our experience as an early entrant in the MRAM space, our employees are frequently contacted by MRAM startups and MRAM groups within larger companies seeking to employ them. The members of our management and key employees are at-will employees and although we issued refresh equity awards to our personnel in connection with our initial public offering, and repriced options in mid-December 2016 to reflect our then current stock price, there can be no assurance that these awards will be effective to retain our key employees. If we lose the services of any key senior management member or employee, we may not be able to locate suitable or qualified replacements, and may incur additional expenses to recruit and train new personnel, which could severely impact our business and prospects. The loss. 24. Table of Contents. of the services of one or more of our key employees, especially our key engineers, or our inability to attract and retain qualified engineers, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We may not be able to effectively manage our growth, and we may need to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements of our growth, either of which could harm our business and operating results.. As we continue to expand our business, we expect our headcount and overall size of our operations to grow significantly. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to expand our operational, engineering and financial systems, procedures and controls and to improve our accounting and other internal management systems, such as our new ERP system that we have recently implemented. This may require substantial managerial and financial resources, and our efforts in this regard may not be successful. Our current systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we fail to adequately manage our growth, or to improve our operational, financial and management information systems, or fail to effectively motivate or manage our new and future employees, the quality of our products and the management of our operations could suffer, which could adversely affect our operating results.. We may engage in acquisitions of, or investments in, other companies, each of which may divert our management's attention, result in additional dilution to stockholders or use resources that are necessary to operate our business.. We may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our business, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. However, our term loan and revolving credit facility prohibits our ability to merge with or acquire any other entity. Even if we were allowed to pursue such acquisitions or investments, they could create risks for us, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties in assimilating acquired personnel, operations and technologies or realizing synergies expected in connection with an acquisition, particularly with acquisitions of companies with large and widespread operations, complex products or that operate in markets in which we historically have had limited experience;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunanticipated costs or liabilities, including possible litigation, associated with the acquisition;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincurrence of acquisition-related costs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiversion of management's attention from other business concerns;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tuse of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tuse of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate an acquisition.. A significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. If such acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our earnings based on this impairment assessment process, which could harm our results of operations.. We may be unable to complete acquisitions at all or on commercially reasonable terms, which could limit our future growth. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt, which could adversely affect our operating results and result in a decline in our stock price and further restrict our ability to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results may suffer.. We maintain operations outside of the United States and intend to expand our international operations, which exposes us to significant risks.. We have limited operations in Europe and Asia. We intend to expand our operations internationally. The success of our business depends, in large part, on our ability to operate successfully from geographically disparate locations and to further expand our international operations and sales. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and subjects us to regulatory, economic and political risks that are different from those we face in the United States. We cannot be sure that further international expansion will be successful. In addition, we face risks in doing business internationally that could expose us to reduced demand for our products, lower prices for our products or other adverse effects on our operating results. Among the risks we believe are most likely to affect us are:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties, inefficiencies and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;. 25. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlonger and more difficult customer qualification and credit checks;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgreater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe need for various local approvals to operate in some countries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties in entering some foreign markets without larger-scale local operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompliance with local laws and regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunexpected changes in regulatory requirements, including the elimination of tax holidays;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse tax consequences as a result of repatriating cash generated from foreign operations to the United States;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse tax consequences, including potential additional tax exposure if we are deemed to have established a permanent establishment outside of the United States;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe effectiveness of our policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and similar regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could increase the prices of our products to customers outside of the United States, increase the expenses of our international operations by reducing the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk if, in the future, we denominate our international sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnew and different sources of competition; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical and economic instability, and terrorism.. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our operations and reduce our revenue.. To comply with environmental laws and regulations, we may need to modify our activities or incur substantial costs, and if we fail to comply with environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or be required to have our suppliers alter their processes.. The semiconductor memory industry is subject to a variety of international, federal, state and local governmental regulations directed at preventing or mitigating environmental harm, as well as to the storage, discharge, handling, generation, disposal and labeling of toxic or other hazardous substances. Failure to comply with environmental regulations could subject us to civil or criminal sanctions and property damage or personal injury claims. Compliance with current or future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our business or require us to modify processes or incur other substantial expenses which could harm our business. In response to environmental concerns, some customers and government agencies impose requirements for the elimination of hazardous substances, such as lead (which is widely used in soldering connections in the process of semiconductor packaging and assembly), from electronic equipment. For example, the European Union adopted its Restriction on Hazardous Substance Directive which prohibits, with specified exceptions, the sale in the EU market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing more than agreed levels of lead or other hazardous materials and China has enacted similar regulations. Environmental laws and regulations such as these could become more stringent over time, causing a need to redesign technologies, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, which could seriously harm our business.. Some of the facilities of our suppliers are located near known earthquake fault zones, and the occurrence of an earthquake or other catastrophic disaster could damage our facilities, which could cause us to curtail our operations.. Some of our foundries and suppliers' facilities in Asia are located near known earthquake fault zones and, therefore, are vulnerable to damage from earthquakes. We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, such as power loss, fire, floods and similar events. If any such disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business could be seriously impaired. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other similar significant business interruptions. Any significant losses that are not recoverable under our insurance policies could seriously impair our business and financial condition.. 26. Table of Contents. Provisions of our credit facility may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.. Borrowings under our existing credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets, except for intellectual property. Our term loan facility prohibits our ability to, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdispose of or sell assets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconsolidate or merge with other entities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur additional indebtedness;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcreate liens on our assets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpay dividends;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake investments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into transactions with affiliates; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tredeem subordinated indebtedness.. These restrictions are subject to certain exceptions. In addition, our existing credit facility requires that we meet certain operating covenants, such as maintaining insurance on the collateral and meeting certain financial covenants, such as a minimum liquidity ratio. The operating restrictions and covenants in the term loan facility, as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into, may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet those covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the credit facility, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness thereunder to either become immediately due and payable or increase by five percent of the interest rate charged during the period of the unremedied breach.. The recently enacted tax reform bill could adversely affect our business and financial condition.. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"2017 Tax Act\"), which significantly amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The 2017 Tax Act, among other things, reduces the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limits the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings, eliminates net operating loss carrybacks, imposes a one-time tax on offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, allows immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifies or repeals many business deductions and credits. The rate reduction took effect on January 1, 2018. Under the new corporate income tax rate of 21%, we expect deferred income tax assets will decrease by $14.8 million and the valuation allowance will decrease by $14.8 million. The net effect of the tax reform enactment on the financial statements is $0 as of December 31, 2017. We continue to examine the impact these changes may have on the business. We are currently analyzing the 2017 Tax Act and this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not fully discuss the 2017 Tax Act or the manner in which it might affect us or holders of our common stock. We urge our stockholders, including potential purchasers of our common stock, to consult with their legal and tax advisers with respect to the 2017 Tax Act and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock.. Our ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.. In general, under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \"ownership change\" is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income, and tax credits to offset tax. As of December 31, 2017, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $100.1 million which will begin to expire in 2028 if not utilized, and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $39.3 million which will begin to expire in 2023 if not utilized. The federal NOLs generated prior to 2018 will continue to be governed by the NOL tax rules as they existed prior to the adoption of the new Tax Act, which means that generally they will expire 20 years after they were generated if not used prior thereto. The federal NOLs generated prior to 2018 will continue to be governed by the NOL tax rules as they existed prior to the adoption of the new Tax Act, which means that generally they will expire 20 years after they were generated if not used prior thereto. We may experience an ownership change in the future, and our ability to utilize our NOLs and tax credits could be further limited by Section 382 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, many. 27. Table of Contents. of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Our net operating losses and tax credits could also be impaired under state laws. As a result, we might not be able to utilize a material portion of our state NOLs and tax credits.. If we fail to retain finance personnel and strengthen our financial reporting systems and infrastructure, we may not be able to timely and accurately report our financial results or comply with the requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC reporting requirements.. We have hired additional accounting and finance staff members to augment our current staff and to improve the effectiveness of our closing and financial reporting processes. Any inability to retain such personnel would have an adverse impact on our ability to accurately and timely prepare our financial statements. We may be unable to locate and hire qualified professionals with requisite technical and public company experience when and as needed. In addition, new employees will require time and training to learn our business and operating processes and procedures. If our finance and accounting organization is unable for any reason to respond adequately to the demands of being a public company, the quality and timeliness of our financial reporting may suffer, which could result in the identification of material weaknesses in our internal controls. Any consequences resulting from inaccuracies or delays in our reported financial statements could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.. Interruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.. We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant disruption to our systems or networks, including, but not limited to, new system implementations, computer viruses, security breaches, facility issues, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures or energy blackouts, could have a material adverse impact on our operations, sales and financial results. Such disruption could result in a loss of our intellectual property or the release of sensitive competitive information or supplier, customer or employee personal data. Any loss of such information could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence, and cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by any such disruptions or security breaches. Additionally, any failure to properly manage the collection, handling, transfer or disposal of personal data of employees and customers may result in regulatory penalties, enforcement actions, remediation obligations, litigation, fines and other sanctions.. We may experience attacks on our data, attempts to breach our security and attempts to introduce malicious software into our IT systems. If attacks are successful, we may be unaware of the incident, its magnitude, or its effects until significant harm is done. Any such attack or disruption could result in additional costs related to rebuilding of our internal systems, defending litigation, responding to regulatory actions, or paying damages. Such attacks or disruptions could have a material adverse impact on our business, operations and financial results.. Third-party service providers, such as wafer foundries, assembly and test contractors, distributors and other vendors have access to certain portions of our and our customers' sensitive data. In the event that these service providers do not properly safeguard the data that they hold, security breaches and loss of data could result. Any such loss of data by our third-party service providers could negatively impact our business, operations and financial results, as well as our relationship with our customers.. If we experience material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.. As a result of being a public company, we are required, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual and interim financial statements will not be detected or prevented on a timely basis. In connection with the audit of our financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in the standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board of the United States. Although we enhanced our internal controls, processes and related documentation necessary to remediate. 28. Table of Contents. our material weakness and to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404, and have concluded that we do not currently have any material weaknesses, there can be no assurances that we will not have any material weaknesses in the future.. When we cease to be an \"emerging growth company\" under the federal securities laws, our auditors will be required to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls. If we are unable to confirm that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.. The issuance of new accounting standards or future interpretations of existing accounting standards could adversely affect our operating results.. We prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. A change in those principles could have a significant effect on our reported results and might affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced. GAAP is issued and subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and various other bodies formed to promulgate and interpret accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. For example, beginning with our first quarter of 2018, we will adopt the new revenue recognition standard, which will change the way we recognize revenue. We do not expect the adoption of the standard to have a material impact on our quarterly and/or annual statement of operations, however the exact impact will be dependent on facts and circumstances that could vary from quarter to quarter. The issuance of new accounting standards or future interpretations of existing accounting standards, or changes in our business practices or estimates, could result in future changes in our revenue recognition or other accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.. Regulations related to \"conflict minerals\" may force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers.. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC has adopted requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements will require companies to perform diligence and disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of our products, and affect our costs and relationships with customers, distributors and suppliers as we must obtain additional information from them to ensure our compliance with the disclosure requirement. In addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free and these customers may discontinue, or materially reduce, purchases of our products, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected.. Risks Related to Our Common Stock. An active trading market may not be sustained.. Prior to the initial public offering of our common stock in October 2016, there was no public market for our common stock. Although our stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, an active trading market may not be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair the value of your shares and your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them. An inactive market may also impair our ability to both raise capital by selling shares and acquire other complementary products, technologies or businesses by using our shares as consideration.. 29. Table of Contents. We expect that the price of our common stock will fluctuate substantially.. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to many factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or others in our industry;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisputes or other developments with respect to our or others' intellectual property rights;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct liability claims or other litigation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tquarterly variations in our results of operations or those of others in our industry;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers and directors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.. In recent years, the stock markets generally have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may significantly affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. These fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our common stock.. In addition, in the past, class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market price. Securities litigation brought against us following volatility in our stock price, regardless of the merit or ultimate results of such litigation, could result in substantial costs, which would hurt our financial condition and operating results and divert management's attention and resources from our business.. These and other factors may make the price of our stock volatile and subject to unexpected fluctuation.. Securities analysts may not publish favorable research or reports about our business or may publish no information at all, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.. The trading market for our common stock will be influenced to some extent by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. As a newly public company, we may be slow to attract research coverage and the analysts who publish information about our common stock will have had relatively little experience with our company or industry, which could affect their ability to accurately forecast our results and could make it more likely that we fail to meet their estimates. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if any of the analysts who cover us provide inaccurate or unfavorable research or issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock price, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports covering us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.. We are an \"emerging growth company\" and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \"emerging growth companies\" will make our common stock less attractive to investors.. We are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \"emerging growth companies.\" In particular, while we are an \"emerging growth company\" (1) we will not be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) we will be exempt from any rules that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotations or a supplement to the auditor's report on financial statements, (3) we will be subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and (4) we will not be required to hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.. We may remain an \"emerging growth company\" until as late as December 31, 2021, the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, though we may cease to be an \"emerging growth. 30. Table of Contents. company\" earlier under certain circumstances, including (1) if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30, in which case we would cease to be an \"emerging growth company\" as of the following December 31, or (2) if our gross revenue exceeds $1.07 billion in any fiscal year.. Investors may find our common stock less attractive if we rely on the exemptions and relief granted by the JOBS Act. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may decline or become more volatile.. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall.. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.. Our directors, officers and principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders.. Our officers, directors and principal stockholders each holding more than 5% of our common stock, collectively, control a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if they act together, will be able to control the management and affairs of our company and most matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders.. Our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.. We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. We have designed our disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.. Provisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. Among others, these provisions include that:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour board of directors has the right to expand the size of our board of directors and to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;. 31. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour stockholders may not act by written consent or call special stockholders' meetings; as a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to take certain actions other than at annual stockholders' meetings or special stockholders' meetings called by the board of directors, the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer or the president;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 - 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of voting stock, voting as a single class, will be required (a) to amend certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, including provisions relating to the size of the board, removal of directors, special meetings, actions by written consent and cumulative voting and (b) to amend or repeal our bylaws, although our bylaws may be amended by a simple majority vote of our board of directors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstockholders must provide advance notice and additional disclosures to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock; the ability to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.. Moreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner."
